11	rant	i know i definitely don’t make a big effort to maintain friendships if they’re not that big for me but at the same time i don’t get why people complain that i never contact them because they never contact me either so can people stop making it like it’s not a 2 people issue
7	It’s just an obligatory social formality. Something that (fake) people say to ease what they perceive as tension in the moment because they cannot comprehend that some people really, truly have no problem with solitude.\n\nSo to keep from feeling awkward about not reaching out more, they say dumb shit like, “omg it’s been FOREVER! We should TOTALLY hang out more, why don’t you ever call me?!” and then we nod and smile, knowing we won’t. It’s all a dumb charade.\n
6	I hate when people do this too. It's like they want to hear from you but not enought to put forth their own effort. It's so disingenuous and hypocritical. Hate it! 
2	Right????? 
2	True to that! People who do this are playing a dirty game, trying to put us in a guilty position.\n\nI would tell them that next time you miss me, don't wait up for me calling you, you can call me too you know! So why didn't you?
12	Frustrated when people aren't candid with you	When they're playing a part and got their walls up and it's so obvious (but they think it's not) do you ever get frustrated and just rage quit? Happened with a guy I've been talking to, I just felt like he wouldn't be real with me so I said my bye byes. Suddenly he gets real asking what happened. I straight up told him I was bored. In truth I was frustrated and tired and understimulated and just not having it. Well he asked me out pretty soon after that, no more games or playing coy.\n\nI think people really don't value each other. Just feeding each other fake bullshit to protect themselves. If there's one thing I can appreciate about ISFPs it's that we seek what's real and if it's real, we don't judge it, we respect the balls on someone who can be candid and we respect human nature. In fact without the real we *wither*. You can feel it in the exhaustion and frustration that seems to come from nowhere as you interact with someone. I mean when something is manufactured it isn't emotionally stimulating and we can feel it it's so transparent. How dissociated do you have to be to get used to that. We shouldn't have to get used to that lifeless bullshit nor should we waste our energy on what doesn't give us life. \n\nSorry but I'm just not coping with that for anyone anymore. Life is too short to waste energy on what doesn't nourish you. If someone wants to be in your life, make sure they've earned a spot by actually being brave enough to show up with you the way you show up with them. Otherwise are they really worth your time?
8	Hoy FUCK this is exactly what has been going on with me.\n\nI started seeing my old.,,. not boyfriend, not FWB, but something in between again. But he is SO. BORING.\n\nSo boring. I will pour my heart out and he will reply with “you’re silly.” or he’ll pick and choose what to reply to in a conversation. \n\nEvery day it was a “How are you?” or a “What are you up to?” and I started getting really frustrated because I want REAL conversations and he only wants small talk. I want him to talk to me about real shit and not ask me “What’s up? Oh cool. Silly. I miss you.”\n\nI can’t explain it well. Basically I ended up straight up telling him I didn’t have feelings for him multiple times but it seems he never comprehends shit I say, so.\n\nI ended up telling him a few days ago that we have nothing in common and he replied, with something to say finally, that “We have more in common than you do with most people” (this was after he said “smfh” and that I was “saying mean things out of the blue”) and I got really pissed off at this. He meant it as in he knows me the most because he’s known me for “so long”. \n\nHe doesn’t talk to be about anything of value, he doesn’t know shit about me as a grown woman, the last time I saw him I was 19 and apparently he thinks I’m still a teenage girl bowing down to his existence for giving me slight attention, and he has the audacity to act like he knows me more than my friends and shit, I BARELY remember any of our past conversations. I barely remember him at all.\n\nHe said “we have more in common than you do with most people”, as in ME, but then he NEVER mentioned himself. He didn’t say “than I do with most people”, as in, he finds that I have a lot in common with him, he said ME. So he’s my knight in shining armer who thinks I’m this sad lonely woman who has nobody to relate to, but like, he has a million others he finds things in common with? Like, should I say thank you??? \n\nI try multiple times to tell his thick skull I’m not interested and I don’t like him and that we should stop talking. He likes to make me feel guilty and he tries to hurt my feelings when I try cutting him off though. I’m too ugly to deal with this, that’s supposed to be the one benefit I as an ugly woman gets, damn it.\n\nHowever, I noticed he’s following a 14 y/o on instagram and liking her posts and I don’t wanna assume anything but I’m gonna go ahead say fuck no on this one.\n\nUh. Sorry.\n\nFeel free to downvote me fam. It turned into a rant....\nI just.... I just.... I had to let this out somewhere.\n\n.... \nAnyway.\n\nTldr: \n\nI feel you, same.\n
3	Yes. Preach. 
3	infp here-  pretty focused on authenticity too but also walled and defensive. I'll never be fake but I need to feel safe and I guess..wanted? when I'm opening up.\n\nI have a close isfp friend I think is getting bored with my candidness though. I can't really tell, he rarely answers anything I say with something clear and meaningful. He says he appreciates honesty and realness but in the moment when I'm putting myself out there he doesn't seem to appreciate the vulnerability or that i'm waiting nervously to see how he responds. Answering with nothing and telling his own story or changing the subject makes me wonder if there's any point in opening up to him. It's just...really tiring feeling like I'm talking to open air.
2	Couldn't agree more. It's definitely noticeable. \n\nSometimes it doesn't even fully matter what they say; often the bravery and honesty of just being real/open is **soo** damn beautiful.\n\nI wish more people understood that. I am literally the least judgemental person you will ever come across. I think we all are.
10	ISFP of all ages, what do you look for in a partner?	Is it:\n- Someone who you could admire?\n- Someone who is creative?\n- Someone physically attractive?\n- Someone who is intellectual / knowledgeable?\n- Someone who is emotionally aware?\n- Someone who is structured and ordered?\n- Someone who is good with people?\n- Someone who is solution oriented?\n\nOr maybe someone who has some other qualities or interesting quirks?\n\nWhat do you look for? Or what are some of the qualities your partner has that you adore?\n\nHope you can state your sex as well, because different sexes could potentially prioritize different qualities
2	Out of the things you listed, I prefer a man who I can admire, is emotionally aware, structured and ordered and good with people. I'm a 20 y/o woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the best trait is emotional inteligence. If I go too detailed, I will never find my man so... Well heck I love big and tall men too.
1	I am an 18 y/o woman and i look for partners who are emotionally mature, good communicators, and supportive/nonjudgmental. I also prefer fiscally responsible men who understand the value of money and men who are decisive without being domineering. 
1	27M, ISFP  \n\n\n1) Definitely someone I can admire  \n2) I love creative people  \n3) I don't give much thought to physical attractiveness. Again, this is a debatable  and everyone has different views.  \n4) Definitively someone who is knowledgeable. If I find interest in that particular subject, it's a Win-Win  \n5) ISFP's are emotionally aware people. It would be horrible if our partners were unemotional. Generally speaking, if I am communicating with someone who doesn't show emotions, I stop communicating. Not worth my time.   \n6) I'm extremely laid back and messy. But I wouldn't mind someone with a certain degree of structure and order  \n7) Definitely. Someone who is a douchebag to others would eventually be a douchebag towards you at some point.  \n8) Being able to find solutions is a great ability. Sometimes I get pissed at people suggesting solutions because I just wanted to vent (to make myself feel better).\n\n:)
1	27 Male\n\nHonestly I just want someone clingy. Clingy people know just how to make you feel appreciated. I'll take a fucking psycho at this point in my life. Sounds exciting.
1	Someone reasonably attractive, emotionally attuned, open to new things and able to engage in a wide variety of deeper conversation topics. I don't care too much about the rest. 28F
1	Honestly most of the men I've been most attracted to have been INTx. I feel like they balance me out. It would be nice to be with someone who was more in touch with their emotions but those guys also tend to bore me unfortunately.
1	24M - someone in good shape who cares about their appearance and fashion. women who work out(resistance training) and have a good shape are most attractive. creativity is great as well, I love when someone likes to draw/paint/make music and is passionate about it, and can appreciate art + aesthetics of things. I am really into pale, blonde women, but like other skin/hair colors as well- this is just my favorite skin/hair combination.\n\noverall a relaxed personality is great, but I like them to be into me enough that I don't have to go out of my way too much to initiate things. \n\nalso someone I can talk to about everything with, like a very good friend. very important too that she's kind and playful\n
1	(19/m)\n\nDon't really want a relationship, but if I had to think of the perfect girlfriend:\n\n* Physically attractive.\n\n* Tough exterior, soft interior. Type of person that doesn't take other people's bullshit and calls them out on their crap, but isn't a troubleseeker. Tries to maintain peace and be pleasant unless provoked. Only shows their soft, caring side to people close to them, and really cares for those. Still has a bit of a playful, spunky side to them in general. \n\n* Has similar interests. \n\n* Open minded and flexible, helps me out of my tunnelvision and challenges me in some ways, but sometimes just more down to earth as well.\n\n* Deeply cares for the things and people she loves.\n\n* Honest and authentic. Clever and aware of things.\n\n(I wonder which type she'd be)
1	I found out I'm too unstable for relationships. 
3	What do you like and dislike about your personality?	
3	I like: Im never angry or arquing about something stupid.\nI dislike: child like and quite shy
3	I am way too shy and closed off when I first meet or encounter someone \n\non the other hand I think I enjoy talking to people and getting to know them genuinely 
1	Pros: Extremely chill, almost never angry, got hella good humor\n\nCons: Will almost never strike up a convo first. Unless I actually need it. Hate breaking the ice, and apprehensive around people.
3	Married/engaged/widowed/etc ISFPs: how did you meet your significant others?	Also, did you kind of *know* or whatever when you met them?? Idk, that’s always seemed like a very Ni-ish thing to me, just curious if any of you have ACTUALLY experienced that:).
1	/crickets
19	What emotion(s) do you feel the most?	This was an interesting question friend my asked me yesterday. It took me a while to think about it. I wanted to say happy, however I don't feel happiness all the time. It's not like I'm sad all the time either tho. So I just said I feel 'at peace'. I don't know wether that is an emotion or not but that was my answer haha. 
24	Anger.
10	We feel all emotions. Sometimes within minutes apart between emotions. ISFP's are sensitive towards that. 
9	According to my observations, Fi doms give off a vibe of seething inner rage. Ni doms seem merely sad/grieving. Happiness seems to belong to extroverted P types. Explosive anger to Te types. I get no vibes from Ti doms :P
7	Im blessed and almost never feel depressed/sad. I wont even quantify that feeling with something as high as 1% of the time because that would still be an overestimate. I am a bundle of joy like 90% of the time, and filled with white hot rage the other 10%. It can change from one to the other as easily as a light switch is flipped. My mood swings are like Hades in Disney's Hercules.
4	does emo count as an emotion?...
5	Emptiness.
3	It takes considerable effort for me to not be a doomer. Despair I guess
2	Lol hope this isn’t TMI but... I’ve cried while having sex 3 different times. Once out of pure love. Another time was from being upset with my partner and feeling emotionally disconnected like I couldnt stop thinking about the issues in our relationship. 
2	The most? Discontentment. I'm an extreme perfectionist and no matter what something can be made better. The aesthetics of my environment, of myself, my knowledge, my emotional intelligence, my sense of humor, cooking skills, there's always something to improve and it's like I never have any rest, never have that feeling that something is done and I can stop. I'm like 90% pretty sure it's what lead to my eating disorder.
2	Lost 
3	Either love/joy, or disgust/anger. I don't get sad or fearful often. \n\nI know there is a lot more variety and nuances to emotions tho...\n\nEdit: INTP here.
1	Anxiety
1	I mostly feel anger, joy, anxiety, and contentment if I had to narrow down the feelings. \n\nHowever, I find that I’m most susceptible to the feelings of those around me, and the empath in me will begin to pick up on those feelings and react accordingly. 
1	Exasperation and dismay
1	Frustration \n\nToo many things that I want to do and I'm just not in the position to do. 
1	sadness and boredom
12	I wish my Brain would make up its Mind...	Hi all, I’ve had a really weird thing the last few days which I get quite often and does my head in. So I’m currently on my week off from work and I’ve been having some time alone at home, my brain will go into the, ‘I want to talk to someone’ faze, my cousin will get home after some time and my brain will just be like ‘omg I want to be alone, jeez’ and I’ll be sitting there in afterwards like, can you make up your mind please!! Does this happen to other ISFP’s often? 
7	Yeap. That's about as ISFP as it gets. Completely normal. 
2	Yeah, it’s normal. I think it also depends just how much social activity you personally can take. I think I can take quite a bit, and I definitely crave it sometimes. However it also doesn’t take me long to want to hide away and regroup. Just the introversion in us, you’re all good!
2	I think we prefer the company of people rather than purely talking to them. I hate being home alone when my housemates are away but lol I don't actually wanna talk to them. 
1	How do you deal with your friends Alienating you?	
7	Go into a deep depression for a couple of hours, take a nap, wake up, get over it. 🤷‍♀️
5	Welp as the friend alienator myself my advice to you would be dont take it personally.\n\nBut then again i allienate everyone equally. If  youre being singled out then that does suck and im sorry. In that case id probably say, allienate them back? Idk what id do.
1	Allow myself to feel angry and sad, until I go to bed. The next morning, it's almost as if they never existed, no matter how attached I felt I was to them. I think the "INFJ Doorslam" is actually "ISFP Doorslam".
19	venting	i want a girlfriend that loves me or hates me.\n\ni want to sleep 17 hours in a row.\n\ni want two buckets of chocolate ice cream.\n\nI want someone to believe in me.\n\n I want to be kissed and relieved when I go to sleep, no matter that I already am an adult.\n\ni want people to invite me out.\n\n I want people to value my songs and that everyone knows who I am.\n\ni want a lot of friends.\n\n I want to be more handsome.\n\ni want to be understood.\n\ni want to be so fucking persistently texted and wanted by a girlfriend and knowing that Im important for her.\n\n I want to have a fight with someone and my face broken.\n\n I want to get off on a rope instead of the ladders in my college.\n\nI want a giraffe costume.\n\ni want to cry while i eat shit and play videogames.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nunmade bed confident keyboard comprehensive bedroom
10	You sound bipolar
8	I wish I was a little bit taller  \nI wish I was a baller  \nI wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her  \nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat  \nAnd a six four Impala
5	Sounds gloomy, miserable, yearning and upsetting. 
5	People will love you when you love yourself. Work on yourself and all these things will come 
3	I hope all of your wishes come true. Especially the giraffe costume ;)
2	Sounds cute x) I hope you get all of it except the broken face part xd
1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsbv27QaQ-U
1	Why a girlfriend who hates you?
1	You can have your wishes. You have to build faith in yourself.
50	Sounds familiar...	
13	My farthest future planning is just an overall ambition
4	For me I have “plans” but not necessarily a time frame to do them, which is weird. 
1	You guys don't have a chatroom?
8	Does the weather affect your mood?	I'm super moody on days like this. Just want the sun to come out. Everything just looks grey and unmotivating. How do you cope with shitty weather? 
3	I can reassure you now that seasonal depression is definitely a thing. Once winter hits where I am, my mood and mental state can get much worse. You just need to keep in mind that it's only temporary, and it's going to get better come spring/summer. Everyone gets it.
3	I prefer sunny, warm, bright days. Days like that makes me want to be productive and just feels good. Rainy days makes me feel nostalgic and laid back. I don't let it bother me too much because I can't change the weather. I just endure it and hope for better days to come. 
2	Sleep as much as possible tbh. A bitch got insomnia and shitty rainy days where you don't feel like driving and going out can be a blessing. I I take advantage of my depression, fam. 
2	Yea i get bummed out all winter pretty much. It snowed the other day and i almost cried when i saw it haha
2	Very. I feel totally dead inside and moody with typical autumn/winter weather/settings around. Grey skies, dead trees, coldness, etc. Blue skies with clouds, sun, warm weather and trees full of leaves make me happy.\n\nI don't really mind rain, though. (Unless I'm outside while it rains)
6	What goes through your head when creating art/anything? Could you explain it if asked?	I’ll try to keep the explanation short, I’ll have a TL;DR at the bottom anyway.\n\nSo, a couple weeks back I was in English class, when we had a mock exam. There was two options for this writing paper; description of a given picture, or a “story where something unexpected happens” . I thought a bit, until I had this idea and wrote about two people on a them park ride gone awry. \n\nAnyway, I finished the paper but wasn’t massively happy with it. I thought it was decent, but nothing special. Fast forward to a couple weeks later, and my teacher absolutely loves it. Top marks. I’m not sure why, and honestly the compliments fell on deaf ears. Still, it was nice to hear. She read it out to the class as i sat there surprisingly uncomfortable. It was a nice gesture but god, I felt I was shrivelling up in my seat.\n\nShe finishes the story, I receive compliments and whatever. Mainly glad it’s over. But then she asks a question. She comes out with “so, what was going through your head when you wrote this?” And I just froze. Not out of anxiety, but genuine confusion. What was going through my head? I sat for a few moments, saying nothing. She rephrases. “Honestly it’s fine, I just want to know your thought process?” And the best I could come out with was “uh.. i just had an idea? I didn’t plan it”. \n\nI just thought it was an interesting thing. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? Just completely unable to provide an explanation for something, particularly something you made?\n\nTL;DR: Wrote a short story. When asked by a teacher to explain how I created it, couldn’t find a genuine answer.
5	I don't have an explanation either. With drawings something pops up in my head and as I draw it I "fix the imagination holes".
5	Yeah I can’t really explain it, it’s kinda best when nothing is going thru my head. I get into “the zone” and it’s all instinct. I’m an audio engineer so most of what I do is very abstract anyway and it’s more about a feeling than any analytical thought process\n\nI know what you mean about compliments, my work is never good enough for me but often people are amazed by it
2	 I mean, it's very cool that you received such a response. and i want to read your thing now, too.  \n  \n*do you read a lot? were you aware of using writing techniques learned in your lessons?* i guess that's the sort of thing they might've been after.  \n  \nAnyway - nice one! hope you feel encouraged if it's something you enjoy doing.
2	I always just have a very vivid idea and once I do it I can alter it and flesh it out however I want. Usually I just try to think of a style or feel I want and something fitting that description eventually comes to me
2	It's always striking to me to learn that a well loved piece of music/art/writing was looked upon as subpar by its creator (Maurice Ravel's *Bolero*, for instance).  It's at once encouraging, that beauty is indeed in the eye, or ear, of the beholder, and discouraging, that someone perceives such depth in something created under less than inspired circumstances.  Art is so weird.\n\nWhatever goes through my head as I'm creating is unique to the piece, and I'm usually happy to give a somewhat superficial explanation of the process.  Sometimes the process is nobody's business.  Like I'm kind of surprised at your teacher's presumption that you'd be willing to share it in front of everyone.
2	Just comes from our subconscious I'd say. 
3	Survey on Personality and Flirting Behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
2	Error with questions 218 and 219 onwards. They both say “I remove clothing” as an example of flirting (now call me insane but I think that is). Unless my monitor is acting up, that’s quite a lot of questions with the same error. 
3	Damn, survey is long. I think adding a "nonbinary" gender option would help some folks :)\nAlso, survey asks about sexuality but defaults to questions about the opposite sex?\nHope the study goes well!
5	Dating an INTJ	What's your experience being like dating an INTJ? 
3	 I have never dated an INTJ in my life. I only had a very close friend with that MBTI type. \n\nPersonality wise what makes you attracted to him/her? 
1	INTx types are my type, apparently, as pretty much every dude I've been very attracted to has been one. My current boyfriend is an INTP. I have dated INTJ's in the past but I don't think I could ever be in a serious relationship with one. I am a hardcore P type and J types in general are just way too structured for me (and conversely my lack of organization and planning would probably be really annoying to them). I like the NT combo though, I feel like they help round me out and get me to think about things more holistically.
8	Can Someone Explain the ISFP Cognitive Functions to Me?	I'm not well learned on the subject and I would love to know all the types of functions and how they affect me.
8	It’s not specific to ISFP, but check out the Personality Hacker podcast, episode 225.\nIn general, it’s a cool podcast for anyone interested in personality types and how they affect our daily interactions. Episode 225 delves into how to determine the cognitive function stack for each personality type.
7	This site did a good job explaining the first four https://www.typeinmind.com/fise
6	DaveSuperPowers has probably the most accurate explanation. His explanations are super simple and not wishy washy or contradictory like all the crap you find on the internet. Start there. 
3	Your functions are Fi Se Ni Te, in that order. Fi and  Se are your conscious functions, which means they are under your control, and Ni and Te are your subconscious functions, which means they are less under your control. Fi is introverted feeling, Se is extroverted sensing, Ni is introverted intuition, and Te is extroverted thinking. Fi is to do with your personal moral values, what is right and wrong to you, such as being authentic, being honest, and being true to yourself. I find that these are common ISFP values, though they might not be true for all ISFPs. Each ISFP decides what his personal values are. Se is how you express those values. Namely, Se is your ‘doing’ function, so you prefer to express your values through your deeds rather than your words. This is what I like most about ISFPs, you are doers, not talkers.\n\nOf course there’s a lot more to Se than that, but that’s a good overview, and you can look up how subconscious Ni and Te effects your psyche at the other aforementioned websites. I hope this helped you start off. Happy self-discovery.
64	ISFP in the wild	
3	1000000% me
3	EVERY TIME . like why do I even agree to these things??
2	Me all the way!! 
2	Meeee
2	Yeah, pretty much
2	I feel like I’m usually the opposite. I never want to go out, but usually end up having fun 🤪.
2	Omg this is soooo meee. Yet that’s not me in the pic loooool. But yeah I went out that one time and I was like “oh noooo I shouldn’t have gone outtt lol  “ and then I stayed out a bit longer and then eventually went home and it was just as lame 😂 soooo relatable like omg are you me??? hahaha duuuude this is too funny 🤣
7	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ISFPs are one of the 8 light types:	
7	Fuck you I'm *edgy*
5	heey... I'm writing a story, I guess.	They were lying down in a single bed watching some series and movies, when she said: -hey!  What if we could get into a movie?\n\n—could be an indie movie please? I don’t like the fan service.\n\n—yes! In a indie mumblegore drama movie, what would be your name?\n\n—wait, why it has to be drama?\n\n—shut up, what would be your name?\n\n—I’d like to be called... Kyo.\n\n—You have given that name to the characters in our videogames.\n\n—yes, and if I had a dog I’d put him that name while I wait for having a kid—. She got playful and looked him in the eyes:\n\n—so you’d want to have a baby? —she asked\n\n—I mean... —she got closer, ready to embrace him, and he felt in a siege of intimacy in where her look was a powerful transparent trojan horse.\n\n—what does your name means?\n\n—I don’t know. It surely has a general meaning, but you’re the one who puts a meaning to your name, right?\n\nShe looked at him perplexed and excited: —yeah! having an assigned meaning is silly. I’ll be Yui EmbraceYourFavoriteSocks.\n\nHe laughed and asked: —what?\n\nshe took advantage of the fact that he lowered the guard, and suddenly tried to kiss him quickly, but she hurt her lip with his teeth. She lamented: — How stupid, I ruined our first kiss :’(\n\nHe kissed her and said: —personaly, I feel this kiss is just as good as what the other would have been.\n\nThe phone alarm rang. Kyo had to leave his room and go to work. Why does everything end at the most inappropriate moment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm planning to write a page every week because if I don't do it I'll become a sloth. Also, I'd like this to have illustrations. any illustrator here wants to work with me in this project? it could be your style, and also, simple drawings, not much effort.
1	Go for it!
3	What are you excited about/working towards right now?	I'm just drunk right now and wanna know what other ISFP's have going through their heads. Heard any new music? Got your dream job? Wassup? Whatchu passionate about?
6	Ah I'm knitting a sweater for myself right now. I'm also digging music and fashion/dresses. I might start doing clothes in the near future (whether by knitting or sewing or something else)
5	I’m working towards buying my own land and building a house. 
3	For me, I get promoted tomorrow to a training manager, which I’m very excited for! I am also excited for going on the Postal train and geeking out with my friends about that one! 😅 
3	I have a full time engineering job, taking a part time masters (Management Psychology) and 10,000 words into the book that I'm writing
3	running for president of a club, just applied to work at my school’s women’s community center next semester as well as a mentoring programming! \n\nin terms of hobbies, I’m excited for the weather to get warmer so I can start practicing roller skating again and jumping rope outdoors! 
3	Preparing for a 2-month trip around Europe starting in a few weeks. Having a fairly hard time settling on a route/things to do, though, and my brother hasn't really been particularly prompt about getting a new passport, so some stress is starting to build up. But it should be pretty lit once it starts more properly coming together and we actually leave.
3	I'm really enjoying Undertale.
1	My puppy is losing his baby teeth and I'm excited for his adult teeth to grow out
27	DAE feel embarrassed after temporarily losing control and “exposing” emotions?	I’m not just talking about the obvious situations, like allowing yourself to have a negative reaction to someone confronting you or hurting you.\n\nI’ve noticed that when I drink (which is almost never, for reasons I’m about to mention) I have a moderation problem and tend to cut loose in a way that’s overall regarded positively...in fact, many have said they love me when I’m drunk.\n\nBut I wake up the next day completely ashamed and humiliated and not ever wanting to be around whoever witnessed it, again.\n\nI went to a wedding last night and had too much to drink. I danced for hours, laughed, made friends, talked to everyone and in general acted like a person my husband and all his dumb friends wish I was irl. They all liked me more than they usually do.\n\nSo why am I so fucking ashamed of myself now? Is it the loss of control? Is it allowing a group of people that I generally dislike, to actually know me and parts of my personality I intentionally keep hidden from them?\n\nWhy am I like this? I hate myself.
9	Yeah. I wasn't expecting or ready to be so vulnerable in front of certain people. Sober me would've been perfectly pleasant, sure, but definitely highly self-regulating in those new social situations. Showing the best or weirdest parts of myself to strangers often leads to regret because I usually feel like they haven't earned it and I feel less special.
5	Yeah, I get this too. One time I was drunk and like, comforted a friend who was getting sad in the function; still felt bad afterwards for this reason. Maybe we need to express more truer emotions in daily life, so that it’s not a sudden shock when we do it when uninhibited? That’s what I concluded.
3	Yeah I also don't drink or do drugs with others, I can't stand the idea of being that vulnerable. Feels like I'm blowing my cover. 
3	"and in general acted like a person my husband and all his dumb friends  wish I was irl. They all liked me more than they usually do. "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's so fucking sad to read that. Really... that makes me sad. I've got introverted friends and I like them better when they "really" are themself, not when they are "extroverted-induced-drunk". It's so fucking cliché to say that but people should like you for who you are, not for whom you're """"""""""supposed"""""""""" to be. Sorry for the f words, non-english native, but really it upsets me...
2	Awwww x)
2	Girl, I feel this too well. I was drinking with some friends one night and the host invited her family members and I started the night super shy and composed per normal. Woke up the next to them laughing about how I kept telling everyone I wanted to eat their ass. I avoided hanging out with them and drinking for like a good 5 months because I was so ashamed. 
2	> I’ve noticed that when I drink I have a moderation problem and tend to cut loose\n\nMeditation helps with that in a big way. Do it a couple of evenings before the day. You still let yourself lose, but in a way that feels more true to you.
2	Oh yes, when I lose my shit and say nasty stuff I always end up cringing really hard afterwards once I cool down. Because of that I try to control what I'm saying when I'm angry. Luckily I'm just not a confrontational person irl, but sometimes a comment here and there on reddit happens.
21	Anyone else sick of ppl trying to control you ?	rant incoming it's a big one:\n\ni'm just fucking sick of friends, bosses, coworkers, people, parents, potential partners trying to control me. like they want to manipulate us into doing what they want when they don't fucking realise that if they just gave us the freedom and respected our autonomy then we *might actually WANT to do what they want* because SHOCKER we actually do want them them to be happy we just need to take care of ourselves first and WE know better than anyone what WE need. do they even realise that the more they try to cling and control the more they actually push us away?! maybe if you LET us do whatever we want you'd realise that "whatever we want" is actually really beautiful and can actually be in your best interests and way more satisfying than the bullshit you try to choke out of us?! maybe you're actually STAMPING OUT the creative potential that you're trying so hard to force out of us and in the process you're actually making us hate you. maybe if you just created a environment where we felt free to explore our potentials and have a great experience without pressure we would actually do something amazing. this has been the narrative my entire life even as a child like STOP MANIPULATING ME AND MAYBE I'LL ACTUALLY RESPECT YOU ENOUGH TO WANT TO DO THIS SHITTY THING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU. THERE'S AN IDEA HEY??!?! THAT I COULD ACTUALLY, SHOCKER, *OF MY OWN VOLITION*, *WANT* TO HELP YOU. THAT I'M AN ACTUAL PERSON AND NOT JUST A PAWN IN YOUR LITTLE GAME. it's so weird how we're the selfish ones when the actual pricks that just made us hate them don't realise that they've actually created their own self fulfilling prophecy. my boss was another one, micromanaging the shit out of me and stamping out my flame then complaining why i put such low effort a year later when i started off on such an enthusiastic high - like mate you actually destroyed any desire i had to create something nice for you, it's amazing that you can blame that on me when you just lost an employee that built sick shit that you actually had to beg for months afterwards for me to come back because you realised how difficult it was to replace me. same with friends who start putting pressure on me for this or that, like do you like me as i am or not, because i sure accept you as you are, if you value that in a person then stop trying to force me into your little story and let me make my own decisions. same with romantic partners who just want to take things too quickly when like you just destroyed any chance of me actually wanting to get with you at all, how about that? like fuck off. i'm so over it. from now on i'm just gonna tell people straight up that i'm not gonna abide their subtle attempts at manipulating and pressuring and if they want to enjoy what i have to offer they've actually got to chill the fuck out and let me do my thing. otherwise bye bye let me know when you've learned to stop sabotaging what you have. i'm done.\n\n/rant\n\nedit: and not only that, i'm sick of people just devaluing what i do only to learn later how much they depended on it..like did you think your weird hostile dictatorial environment would actually encourage me to keep producing value?? what the fuck are you on? like do you like ME or do you just like how well i follow your instructions and abide your hints and demands?
6	It’s actually amazing how close to home this hits for me. My work has learnt that to get me to perform you literally leave me to it, or I’ll make everything hell. My friends that have gotten too clingy or tried to change me or ignore me in a clingy or unhealthy way, I’ve pushed them all back now, it’s going to take someone very special to get close to me again. And I’ve been single for so long due to multiple issues that once again, I’d rather be single than with some toxic person.l that hindered my ability than just lets me live my life. I love my freedom, I love people being themselves and really achieving there goals but I can’t tolerate the manipulation or the clinginess that some people as you said was suffocating. 
3	Yeah i feel you. I'm totally happy to help someone with their goals at work or whatever situation for the pure satisfaction of helping, and contributing in my own way. But when I feel I'm being controlled or manipulated I will go completely in the opposite way and will completely disengage, turn into a shit employee/friend or just quit altogether 
3	I endorse this rant 100%\n\nI could not have expressed what you just did as well as you did.  I relate to every word in it. \n\nFuck those guys with a 10 foot pole.  \n\nYou know what?  Fuck them 10 times harder so they have an actual reason to bitch and whine about yourself being assertive.\n\nHad someone INFURIATED and REVOLTED about me making the statement "Do not nit pick and scold me all time time about petty ridiculous trivialities."  OH MY GOD.  I WAS SO AUDACIOUS....FOR...WHAT WAS IT   oh ya.  They said my transgression was getting "DEFENSIVE."  And furthermore, it was "EXACTLY WHAT I ALWAYS DO.  SHIT LIKE THIS."  \n\nYa.  Well for this "person," there will not be me being "defensive" again.  I let her know any attempt whatsoever to contact me in any circumstance will lead me to being "offensive."  I will hit her 10 times for the shit she intends to do to me in future, and 10 times for all the shit she has done to me in the last two years.  \n\nYou wake me up screaming to do some stupid assed shit like put a couple things in the trash I didn't do out of respect for them?   \n\nYou better hope it's not the 80th fucking time you have attempted to emotionally abuse me.  \n\nIt's over.\n\nIt's never fucking happening again.\n
3	– Ugh! Why you gotta be like that?!  \n– Like what?  \n– \*angry sigh\*
1	Lol yeah. I just don't care about them. People that loves you and knows you won't pressure you into doing things you don't feel like doing.\n\nI always welcome contrary thoughts tho. If I only act by impulse I would be a piece of shit.
1	I agree
5	What is your opinion on minimalism?	
8	As an idea to break out of the capitalist way of thinking and proving to yourself that you don’t need materialistic items to be happy, I think it’s a great step forward for anyone. Its less wasteful and promotes behaviour that will benefit the environment and everyone on this earth. It’s something I practice and want to explore further. 
4	as an aesthetic (ie architecture, textiles), i love it.\n\nas fine art, it’s whatever.
2	I love it but I'm incapable of it.
1	I love it, I never used to be able to maintain it, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve gotten better at it! 
1	I like the idea of it a lot, but I don't know if I could maintain it. I sometimes try to dress with a minimalist style, but I also like more interesting stuff a lot too
1	I have an interest in minimalism, and I've been wanting to practice it for some time.
1	I love it, been a minimalist since I was a kid. Helps keep your mind organised. It's actually only now that I've been buying more stuff and treating myself.
1	I am actually very interested in Living a minimalist lifestyle and i look up to it.    I don't think i want to live a minimalist lifestyle for my whole life tho just until i retire.\n\njust for my young years when i start working onto maybe 35-45 years old?   And save all my money not spending it on stuff i don't need. \n\nso i could be using capitalism to my advantage by living a minimalistic lifestyle still try to get a nice hardworking job so i can retire early.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni  love the idea of of being a successful person but living relatively humble lifestyle with only the base essentials and hiding my wealth so no one will judge you for it and use you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust recently iv'e had a rain check on why material privileges can be hurtful and damaging. As it can always be taken away from you and leave you behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	I watched a documentary on it on Netflix (called minimalism lol) and I LOVED it and made everyone I know watch it. I initially got rid of a lot of stuff after watching it, and have been better about getting rid of stuff I don’t care about, but I’m definitely not a minimalist, and I continue to be extremely messy. I think I love minimalism in theory, but not in practice. Tbh, I think I got super into the documentary because the videography and music was absolutely beautiful, and as stereotypical as it sounds, I wanted to become a minimalist just for the aesthetic lol.\n\nI’m definitely more of a minimalist when it comes to clothes. I say all the time that I wish I could be like Steve Jobs and wear the same outfit everyday, but I’m a girl and I’m still in school, so if you wear the same thing over and over, people start asking lol. But if I could, I would wear my nice fitting San Francisco navy blue sweatshirt, skinny jeans, and my checkered vans every single day. Choosing clothes everyday seems like a needless hassle, and the whole fast fashion business is disgusting in its general treatment of workers.
3	What are your views on culture?	
3	I feel that culture is everything, every interaction, every influence. All cultures are constantly changing and morphing, it's a dynamic thing and the blending of cultures should be celebrated. It's cool to appreciate the lost cultures of the past however I feel that efforts to preserve dying cultures are wasted. I think people can be too precious about how sacred their culture is. I know this is a controversial mindset but I grew up in a very multicultural town and am so greatful to have been able to experience and embrace the cultures of my friends. Despite not being born into their cultures, I feel that they are a part of my own.
2	it's good
2	Culture to me is fascinating, I love learning about it, but I would never go deep into it at the same time
2	Some are good, some are bad.  there are good and bad aspects of some
1	No real opinion, not too interested overall. Some aspects are interesting, though, like folk myths/legends.
22	anyone else a very lonely person?	
21	The worst feeling is feeling lonely in a group. 
7	Yes and no. I have a large friend group, and support system in general. But I feel like I tend to feel a little lonelier in large groups than I do completely alone...
7	yes
6	Weirdly enough, I feel lonelier when I'm in a group than when I'm alone. I can't click with most people. Even on Tinder, I can hardly find someone I can picture having casual sex with because it just doesn't feel right. I feel lonely on social media too, I feel no one cares about me and just follows me "because". They never even reply to my questions widget, it's really void and I just can feel the gap between their ways of being and mine. I only become "hypersocial" when I'm manic, but I really hate friend groups. I had one last year. It felt like a constant strain, I was overwhelmed, I was the "out of place" one who didn't like Kpop but thought I was able to change, I didn't have anything in common with them and they were always calling me "overly dramatic". I didn't get their humour, I found it lame and almost embarrassing. They fucked me over several times and I called it quits by disappearing, and though they later apologized, I was never able to come back.\n\nBut once I'm entirely by myself, I don't feel so lonely anymore. Sure, I need social interaction like any human, but my two therapists and the strangers on the street, or my mum (when we have something to talk about), are enough. I have one very close friend who lives in India, and while we can't really talk right now because she's busy af (she's graduating soon, the homestretch is always hard), I know we always have this love for each other and it's just what I need. I sometimes visit my relatives too when I've got money for train tickets, and it "recharges" my social meter, so to say. I always feel good around them, and I can never feel unhappy after spending time with them. A few weeks ago I went to visit my great-aunt who lives 2 hours away from me, and I loved every little bit of the weekend. Even the Airbnb host was really good to me. It was great. It's the simplest pleasures of life.\n\nI only need myself, my cats, my family and my friend, whom I feel is possibly the person I want to spend my life with. I don't need all that "have a group of friends" garbage, or parties, or "nights out with the girls". That stuff is excessive and completely overrated. Simplicity and trust are happiness, in my books.
6	Not really. I have the fortune to be in a great family, and I have a very supportive group of friends. I'm very lucky and happy they exist.
3	In what sense?
3	Im not very lonely but Im little bit lonely because I dont usually start the convorsation when im talking to the stranger and I dont like to be in a big group. It gives me anxiety somehow meaby because I think too much what people think about me. 
2	Absolutely. When I have good friends I have this horrible feeling that we're in the process of drifting away. Every time I see a good friend I worry that it's going to be the last. When I meet people who I click with, I'm self destructive and don't make any effort as a defence mechanism. So it's self inflicted, and I know I need to shift my perspective because on paper I have a lot of friends and I should be really happy.
3	Favorite YouTube​ Channels	Hi! I'm posting this for my ISFP husband because he doesn't have a reddit account. A few days ago, my family talked about our favorite channels and what we watch are so different. My strategist INTJ brother spends most of his time on informative or historical channels while I (mechanic ISTP) love watching a guy tearing down phones and game consoles. My husband just watches movie trailers and some game reviews on YouTube but he doesn't have any specific channel he likes.\n\nSo do you guys have favorite channels to share? He's into games and anime but is open to anything. He's more curious to see what his type likes to watch. Thanks!
7	I mostly watch vine comps, the Try Guys, Kurtis Conner, Brad Mondo, John Oliver, Trevor Noah, etc. I basically only watch comedy centered stuff tbh.
4	Nikolas Omilana\nPewdiepie\nTrue Geordie\nMatt D'Avella\nEroldStory\n\nIdk these are some of my favourite YouTubers

14	What are some unfair assumptions you make about other mbti types?	Any person who claims to be an ISFP but has an anime character for their profile pic or talks about being *obsessed* with anime, I automatically assume is an INFP. Am I wrong? *Almost definitely.* Am I able to stop this assumption? *Not really*. Do any of you have weird, inaccurate assumptions about other types??
10	I now assume every INTP is a jerk r/iamverysmart type that doesnt know shit about emotions and how to deal with them.\n\nHopefully there are INTPs that learned about these things and are mature enough, but I always assume this. 
4	Everytime I see a person who is an xSTJ I automatically assume he/she has good work ethic. Could not be the case for everyone but lol\n\nIt doesn’t in any way affect how I deal with them, when it comes up in my head I try to acknowledge it as not necessarily true though\n
5	TIL I'm an INFP.\n\nI'm not sure how inaccurate it is, but I generally view FJs and TPs as rather emotionless. Mainly ExTPs and IxFJs.
4	ENTJs are overly competitive in social situations \nand are insecure about their deeper emotions.\n\n\nENTPs habitually use people for gain.\n\nEdit:i think i just missed the intention of this post. Sorry. \n\n
2	I fucking detest people who use an anime picture as their profile picture. I'm sorry dude. I know you feel like a ninja, but you don't even kind of resemble Naruto. Also only a casual watches that crap. Fight me.
2	Idk about you guys but every ISTJ/ISFJ i have met i have had an incredibly hard time trying to have fun with them because (in my experience) they’re only really comfortable doing things that they’re comfortable/familiar with and never want to do anything new so the assumption grew on me :/
1	Wait what? All the ISFP's I know love anime.
1	I mean, having an anime pfp =/= obsession with anime. I don’t watch anime anymore but still use some characters as profile pics because i’m lazy
5	what are your favorite human senses?	
10	I would probably be most devastated if I lost my hearing. Music is everything to me. Would be super depressing not being able to hear music ever again. 
3	If I lost hearing It'd be over. Like /u/latroargentum said music is everything to me and it gives life colours that I thought it never had
2	1. Taste\n2. Hearing\n3. Touch\n4. Sight\n5. Smell
2	I'd say intuition. 
2	Hearing, no doubt. I'd rather be blind
2	Sight and touch.
4	What pokemon type would you be?	
4	I’m very laid back but can be very fiery if something greats my interest, I would like to say Dragon type but I think Psychic or Dark would be closer lol
5	Flying 
4	Easily a ghost type. I ghost people all the time. I only reveal myself to very few people. I'm a homebody. I hate intruders. Must I say more?
3	Not sure, but I'm a big fan of Ground Pokémon.
3	Id be both grass and fire type
3	Snorlax is my favorite. Chimchar is adorable as well. That's all I know, lol.
2	Squirtle x)
2	Either Ice or Ghost. For a specific Pokemon, I'd be a Banette.\n\n~~but technically being both Ice/Ghost would make me a Froslass, fits too I guess~~
32	Does anyone here have a kind of hero-complex?	Like you always need an altruistic goal in life? You feel that unless you are working for a bigger cause, your work and life is of no use. You are always sticking up for the underdog in any situation, and the first thing you do when you see a new event, is to judge it by your moral yardstick. You always end up making underdog friends and are intentionally a bully to the bullies.
4	Yep. White Knight Syndrome.
2	I had that in middle school then got my ass handed to me
1	Yeah, for sure
1	Yup
1	I have always been drawn to working with people with disabilities and I can identify with this. Every time I have thought of leaving my career in special education, I’ve been drawn to other jobs involving helping people who are disadvantaged. 
1	I'm the opposite, I find people who think their worth is decided by how selfless and helpful they are rather annoying. Can't hate them, though, since in person they're pretty nice. Their thought process just pisses me off.
2	"Fly me to the moon Let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars	In other words, hold my hand\nIn other words, darling, kiss me\nFill my life with song" - Diana Krall\n\nDiana Panton cover: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSuxSQQkFE\n\nLove these lyrics 🖤\n\n\n\n
4	Any other autistic/on the spectrum ISFPs?	Also, what differences do you notice between you and other ISFPs?\n\nFor me (I have Asperger's), while I do know ISFPs don't really value Fe, I know most ISFPs are still pretty good at actually using it. For me, it's quite stunted. I also don't really do typical Se activities, I generally just stay indoors and spend time behind my PC.\n\nI'm also under the impression that my Fi is even stronger than that of the average ISFP, I can get offended very easily by the right words or actions, but most ISFPs seem to be pretty chill and have a "live and let live" attitude. Like, I mean I won't actually confront someone or call them out on something, but it definitely makes me resent people easily.\n
3	I have really bad anxiety and depression, so I have to take pills. I get offended easily, am scared of picking up the phone, and get extreme anxiety when I am in the presence of a high class person. I could stay home forever as long as I have Wi-Fi. Humans scare me. Dogs and cats are cute. I also have ADD. 
2	🙋🏼‍♀️ 
1	I just did the [aspie quiz](https://rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php) on the beautiful rdos website. apparently i'm a bit more neurodiverse than i was jan of last year!  \n  \n>Your neurodiverse (Aspie) score: 118 of 200  \nYour neurotypical (non-autistic) score: 76 of 200  \nYou are very likely neurodiverse (Aspie)  \n[the diagram thing](http://www.rdos.net/eng/poly10a.php?p1=87&p2=80&p3=59&p4=57&p5=41&p6=55&p7=48&p8=85&p9=25&p10=85)
12	ISFP art - (M/16) - First ever attempt at drawing anything representing me/the ISFP personality. Isn’t anything necessarily crazy, nor impressive, but I felt happy enough with it to share. Have a go at understanding it, I’ll happily explain in comments if asked :)	
2	The first thing that came to my mind... what does the 100% battery mean? And the thought bubble above it? 😃
2	Very nice ! Are you going to color it? 
10	me_irl	
4	Don't ask questions that you don't want the answer to.
2	I mean would ya really want them to say yes? At that point the Fi just becomes Fe
1	When Fi shines
1	yeah isfps like what we like and each have very individual taste
1	"Shit's dope"\n\nI probably say that like 150 times a day
5	Does anyone else have a hard time getting along with INFJs?	I find them almost impossible to get along with. It annoys me to no end how they think they have me/other people “figured out” and they usually come off as really disingenuous to me. I also just find it hard to talk to them about things in general unless it’s super abstract (not interesting) or about me (I’m very private). They seem to need to control the conversation all the time and if it doesn’t go their way they start to get weirdly stressed. 
8	Yes. They’re totally self absorbed. I’m in an ISTP group on Facebook because I border ISFP/ISTP and that personality type, in particular, (along with INTJ’s) are constantly barging into conversations uninvited to share their opinion. INFJ’s appear to at least want to contribute to a conversation but they manage to be overly involved and feely. INTJ’s want to dominate a discussion and make everyone else look inferior. They’re so fucking annoying. 
9	Yes, actually! I tend to get along with just about everyone, but INFJs tend to rub me wrong. Usually I’ll try being friends with them, and they’ll end up being kind of cold or rude, so I think it’s more that INFJs don’t like me for whatever reason. Usually, the INFJs I’ve known have been kind of loners, so I try to befriend them, and they just do not like me.\n\nI knew an INFJ who’s family immigrated here illegally, so her family was pretty financially unstable. I became friends with her (or so I thought) and learned that a lot of times, they didn’t have food in their house, so I started bringing her lunch everyday. I didn’t make a big deal about it in front of others and she always seemed grateful. At the end of the year, one of my best friends told me that the INFJ said that I was annoying. I don’t get my feelings hurt super easily but *damn that hurt*. When I messaged her about it (basically “hey, I’m really sorry if I got on your nerves, but I wish you would’ve asked me to back off instead of talking about me behind my back”.) she was super apologetic and said that “she didn’t think I thought of her as a friend either”.\n\nThough my experiences with other INFJs haven’t been as extreme, they’ve been similar. Idk, INFJs tend to seem kind of nice at first but end up being kind of fake and self absorbed. It might just be something about me, too, but I think I’ve had more negative experiences with INFJs than any other type.
30	Who here is not a fan of their birthday?	Because mine is coming up and every year I get irrationally meh about it all
9	I don't celebrate them haha
5	I use to not be but after my last birthday im starting to appreciate them alot more
6	Oh my goodness me!!!!!! I never thought that had something to do with my personality type. I have issues with all attention on me. I hate it. It’s the reason why I’m eloping. \n\nI feel like it’s so much pressure!!!! Something I started doing is just not getting on Facebook at all on my birthday. I felt like it was so stressful telling everyone thank you and it was taking away from the day. Not to say I’m not thankful for people taking the time to wish me happy birthday, it really means so much. It was just taking away from the day. I now get on there and personally thank each person the day after! 
3	My friends will decline my invitations to hang out every now and again, but they never turn down my birthday. Such a good excuse to get all of my close friends and not as close friends into the same area doing some nonsense. Normally I do a barbecue and tell people to bring their own beer. I love my birthday.
3	I don’t like getting reminded I’m getting older so I just see it as another day. But people have gone out of their way to make it seem special in the past so I appreciate that. 
2	I’ve always had something really important that comes up on my birthday so I’ve never really found it special. Last year I travelled to Australia on it because that way it was a good excuse to ignore the birthday messages lol. But I like the placement of them, not necessarily the attention that comes with it. 
2	Today is my birthday and honestly.. https://youtu.be/CSKVAo9CK7Y
2	Idk i started to like then after a while 
2	finally someone feels the same way I do! i really dislike my birthday I always feel like I have to live up to people’s expectations and never truly enjoy myself. I really like celebrating other people’s bdays tho
2	I'm just okay with it. As a kid it was always great to get gifts and have visitors, but nowadays I don't really have much I want (well, I do, but they're too expensive to ask for a birthday gift) and I don't really have many visitors I want to see. The people I do want to see I see on a regular basis anyways. And yeah, the attention is really ugh.
1	I utterly despise my birthday. - INTJ 
1	Oh yeah I hate my birthday 
6	What are some of your toxic traits? What are the parts of you that really make you feel shame?	and for the love of god please dont say some egotistical shit like "I care for people too much ;( " 
15	When I am in a bad mood I project it. I see myself doing it too. Which makes me feel even worse. Which makes me keep doing it. Its a fucking endless spiral.\n\nI constantly flake at the last fucking second. Its because I never wanted to go, and when it finally comes time I just admit to myself I will be happier not going. People don't invite me out as much as they used to as a result. Which is fair.\n\nI am very dangerous and irrational when you piss me off. Dangerous in the sense that I don't even know what I am fully capable of. I am not someone you wanna cross. I purposefully become as big of a cunt as humanly possible. I will lose a war to win a battle. I am not too timid to resort to physical violence. I will make damn sure you don't want to cross me again.
11	I can be incredibly selfish, often at the expense of others. 
8	I am territorial about the things that I like and don’t like being friends with people who infringe on my sense of individuality (which is childish and unreasonable) or people who devalue my interests. \n\nI prioritize self preservation over others’ emotions almost every time. \n\nI can be so non confrontational that instead of being upfront about issues i’m having with people, I let negative feelings and resentments bottle up and fester until I’m fed up. I am guilty of ghosting/door slamming people without even a warning sign which is unfair to them considering they didn’t have the opportunity to explain their perspective. \n
7	If someone does something like interrupt or talk over me (multiple times), mansplain, or say something really offensive about a group of people, I basically stop acknowledging them. Instead of working past it and staying on civil terms or telling them why I don’t like what they did. (Cuz I don’t like that kind of conflict.) \n\nIt’s fine if you don’t have to interact with them, but they’re in my work cell at work and currently is sleeping in my living room so it gets AWKWARD in those situations. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
3	I'm constantly late to everywhere I go. Some days I force it so I run so late, I end up pissing off the people who are waiting for me to arrive so much that they say forget it and I get to stay home. I have an unhealthy relationship with my anger. Usually, I can hold back but that just leads to build up until I eventually explode. I hate mess but find ways to avoid it instead of addressing the mess. Every time I get into a new relationship, I immediately don't want to be in a relationship. \n\n:')
3	I tend to talk about myself. A LOT. Because I'm very introspective and constantly try to figure out my place in the scheme of things. I'm incredibly self-centered.\n\nI'm a bit embarrassed to say it but I'm not overly interested in other people's lives. I care about them, but I don't want to know their life details.\n\nI'm emotionally unstable (but it has more to do with BPD and possible bipolar than being an ISFP, I reckon)\n\nAt some point, I just disappear and ignore people. Not with everyone, but sometimes I have friends and one day, everything they do or says irks me for a reason I don't even know. It makes me feel bad but I can't ever bring myself to come back.\n\nI am either super altruistic or selfish to the point of "if you die, I don't even give a shit".
3	when someone pisses me off and wrongs me if i don't express that im pissed of at someone and am alone. i use my demon function which is TI and just start going ham on thinking how i can take them down. \n\nsuch as thinking of actual ways to hurt them by like thinking  to get them to go to a boxing match with me or a streetfight or just thinking of giving them a Suckerpunch and for some reason i enjoy having these thoughts in my head when i am angry at them.\n\n Seems toxic to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I especially despise people who try to convert me to their ideology, People who get really precious about their beliefs, values and opinions. I don't even pretend to be interested in them.\nEveryone is expected to be part of a group or movement and if you're not interested then somehow you are meant to be part of the problem. I'm an individual human being and I find ideologies toxic. Conversely, that makes me come across as toxic.
1	i isolate myself a lot
4	Can anyone relate to this?	Someone mentioned a while back to add age to these posts, and I like the idea. 28 male.\n\nI don't know many people who are as loyal to their inner circle as I am. If people talk about my friends behind their backs I'll stand up for them even if it causes conflict. I normally go to extreme lengths to avoid conflict. If a friend needs help I will go to the end of my branch to help them. Even if that means risking breaking my own branch. If I see someone doing you wrong, or think someone is doing you wrong I will let you know. If you need a friend to talk to at 3 a.m. feel free to call me even if I have work in the morning. If a bar fight breaks out I will more than happily risk getting stabbed to help you out. If you need someone to call you stupid to get you back on track. I will. If you need someone to help you bury a body. I will. If I can't help you. I will find someone who can.\n\nThese statements only scratch the surface of what I will do for people in my inner circle. If you drove up and just said, "I can't tell you why. Put on this blindfold and get in." I would blindfold up, get in, and not ask questions. My inner circle is a very small list. I know damn well they aren't gonna hurt me intentionally. I don't how else to explain what I am willing to do. I will do almost anything. I'm not gonna join a cult and drink the cool aide with you. I'm just gonna beat the fucking stupid out of you. I am always the person they call when they fuck up. I don't know if its because I'm reliable, or if they just feel comfortable telling me the whole truth. I am always the person they call when they need help, and nothing could make me happier. I pride myself on being able to be there for my close friends.\n\nThis just applies to my inner circle though. I will extend above average human kindness to 99% people, but I won't go out of my way in any regard. This includes my blood relatives with my mom and dad being the only exception. I would kill someone for hurting them. I honestly don't know if anyone else will ever make it into my inner circle. I don't get out much. I'm a homebody. Occasionally my ENTJ best friend drags me into his newest scheme to take over the world, but thats about it. Its not that I'm bad at making friends. I fucking excel at making friends. I just don't become close to people anymore. I only have so many hours in a day, and I have enough close friends to fill those hours as is.
13	Do you feel like you can be super judgmental /selfish sometimes?	I'm a very independent naturalistic kind of person. The thing is I have a friend who is a cog in the corporate machine. I had no idea I was so judgmental until I found myself accidentally revealing my judgement for corporate professional people to her while talking about others. It was too late to backtrack and I just let it slide but I could tell I said something a bit tactless. Similarly I have other judgements about things, like anxiety being an unhealthy thing despite the fact that she very clearly suffers from it. I feel really bad, I probably said 2 not very nice things. It's just that I guess I value individuality so much I do judge those who sacrifice that for boring secure jobs and value that lifestyle. And I know we need all types of people but I have all these unconscious judgements that help me define and differentiate who I am. Especially since I had a really bad experience working in the corporate world which I guess I still haven't processed. Wonder if other ISFPs suffer from this and what you do about it. For the record I do like and care about her even though I probably just made her feel worse about herself which I would not have done if I thought ahead. It's pretty selfish and I guess I wanna know if others here have felt this and what you've done about it.
1	Entp here you might want to just read Enneagram 4 and look at the healthy unhealthy distinctions and that might help give you a guide to understand why your own personal values, introverted feeling might not be good outside of yourself in certain scenarios
1	Not from around here (infp), just curious, you say let it slide, does that mean you're going to leave it as is, with her maybe feeling badly? \nI'm sure you plan to be more careful in future, I just couldnt imagine not needing to clear the air. And I'm curious how you isfp's tick.
1	I only have that when I'm spending too much time online (which is often, like today). Total salt generator.
0	Like you, I am Also judgey of corporate cogs and I hate capitalism. I hate capitalism because it is so harmful to people, animals, and the environment and corporate cogs just perpetuate its existence more than others.\n\nWe should still try not to be jerks though.
1	heard a romantic song on the radio	and it inspired me to make a playlist\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgky6BavuiBzbeM65Ehko_P4a
14	Does anyone else not find ExTPs charming?	For some reason everyone constantly says ExTPs are extremely charming and hard to dislike, but I find that they're not charismatic at all. If anything, they seem rather creepy in general. Mature ones are just alright, though.
14	I generally find ENTPs as annoying edgelords and ESTPs greasy and pervy :/ Both also egotistical if immature. I had to call an ESTP friend-of-a-friend today and their voicemail message was an entire monologue of their whole life. 
6	I am an ENTP, and I definitely wouldn't consider myself charming. I'm witty, and I have the skills that are usually associated with being charming, but I never really put much effort into that type of thing. Usually I come across as really funny, unique, and eccentric, which definitely isn't considered charming by most people out there. Along with that, I do have that stereotypical ENTP problem with randomly starting debates about stupid (and often controversial) crap, and then finding some credible bullcrap I can use to argue it (they stand there and look at me like I'm stupid, but they can't find a good way to prove me wrong). Honestly, the charming stereotype seems pretty off, at least for ENTPs. Healthy ones sometimes come across as charming, but the majority of us don't usually give that vibe.
2	My husband is an ENTP and my brothers are ISFP’s. I can’t figure out why my brothers don’t really enjoy my husband, help a girl out!  Haha
2	ENTPs can be annoying, but ESTPs are annoying.\n\nMy Opinion, so feel free to downvote. 
2	I'm here from the ENTP raid. Lol\n\nENTP's are energetic idea generators that use logic to try and discover things. It's my experience that isfps do not like to engage in banter, fast-paced conversation or speaking in analytical ways.\n\nThe ones that I know are more concerned about sticking to what's true about themselves and speaking about their opinions in a very subjective way that makes it difficult for you to say something without feeling like you're telling them that they are wrong in their experience is not valid.\n\nTo be fair I have one of my closest friends that might be an isfp and we grew apart in college and we learned how to communicate and have always been really close and more so and post-college\n\nI also think that the isfps do not speak their mind fully or they don't think out loud which makes for slow going with entps
2	Can someone please get the violent ponies out of here!?
2	What is your gripe with them, how are they creepy?  I would describe myself as charismatic and charming as per outside feedback. I think SFPs and NTPs are just not very into each other in general.
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/entp] [An Ego Check from r\/ISFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/avxbui/an_ego_check_from_risfp/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	Then you haven't met an actual ENTP
1	Meh... they're easy to talk to and seem to be the only type of people who wanna be around me. :l
1	My crush is ENTP 
1	I don’t generally have strong opinions about ExTPs, simply because they are so different from myself, so I don’t generally know any of them all that well. I love IxTPs though, but mostly because they tend to be overly awkward and detached, and I think it’s kind of cute tbh.
1	As an ENTP I feel the best way to describe it’s like being charismatic but never charismatic enough to get anything I want. There’s definitely certain social things that come pretty easy to me, as others in the thread have said I tend to come off as pretty unique and I’m a pretty good speaker and pretty open and honest. So yeah these things all lend me to be pretty charming or at least charismatic in the right moments. But I’ve never got the impression that it was ever enough to get me anything or confirm that I’d win anybody over. I find that oftentimes I just feel out of place and like I’m too scared to take certain risks. I think the people who are impressed by me are just impressed that I’d say certain things. To me the shit I say isn’t a risk, I really just don’t care to hide certain things about me so being confident then isn’t hard. So yeah is their charm there? Sure. Do some just find it creepy? Definitely. Always feel like I’m in this middle zone and I just wish I could cross it.
1	I would call ENTPs charismatic, as a presumptuous generalization, as opposed to charming. \n\nThey often have magnetic personalities, but recall that magnets are polarized - as such, ENTPs tend to be polarizing. \n\nI do speak as an ENTP-A. 
5	What podcasts do you like?	
2	Your classics like My Favorite Murder, And That’s Why We Drink, Spirits, etc. However, I also listen to podcasts that relate to my current interests, such as the Female Farmer Project, and I’ve been looking into some Lutheran podcasts (I’m kind of in the process of converting?) Overall, entertainment and niche interests.
1	Welcome to Nightvale
1	The official podcast \n\nThe misfits podcast

4	When a bear drinks beer it becomes unbeerable.	You’re  just too distant for my arms. Maybe you’re too far for my hugs. Could my imagination be as long to reach you somewhere and taste you? I don’t know what I really feel. I wonder what you think about me, if you're cold enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  wake up at night and cry fucked up. I'm still afraid of the dark. Gosh i’d do anything to have some of your sweetness now. but I'm very scared that  something grabs me from under the bed if I put one foot on the floor.  why you far flan?
1	Sounds like you need lots of love, comfort and a hug. 
6	The 7 Work Habits of Highly Effective Introverts	
5	I don’t like this article. It’s the habits of how to be a successful wage slave. This doesn’t exactly align with my values of success. 
2	> Highly Effective\n\nMe, scanning all seven qualities and realizing I possess none of them: 😐
9	Does anyone else find the ENFP girls the most attractive of all?	they are nice and mentally stimulating, also warm and talkative without loosing their individuality. they're the only extroverts with whom i can watch a lot of series during a lot of time, even fights are fun and entertained. rainbows flow everywhere.
12	I get along with them pretty dang well. Lots of ENFP friends. Over time I usually find them less attractive, because a lot of times it feels like they're obsessed with themselves and most of the time we spend is me listening to stories about their personal lives. Which is fine, it's just not as interesting.\nTo be fair, I'm in college, so like everyone is obsessed with themselves.
5	Most of the ENFPs I know are a little bit on the looney side, which is really entertaining friendship-wise but I don't know if I'd be able to handle it in a relationship. I do like them a lot though! 
4	ESFJ or ESFP for me. 
2	ENFP get easily bored. Even more with an average ISFP. Hate to burst your bubble, but this relationship is usually quite one-sided
1	Met an ENFP during a MBTI Google Hangout call that started from Reddit. She was very fun to listen to. Really attractive too. And cute. And smart. 
1	My best friend is an ISFP (I’m an ENFP) and we vibe so so well. My ex boyfriend was also an ISFP and we both very much were attracted to each other and enjoyed being around each other. Oh and my sister is also an ISFP. I love ISFP’s ^_^
1	My boyfriend is an ENFP :)\n\nCan confirm that he is attractive.
6	How do I stop being rude?	I'm nice to literally everyone I know but this one person can annoy me a lot. I think they're an ENFJ and I always try to be nice to them however after a while the rage starts coming out. It's not because they're like being rude to me as well, it's cause I can feel like they're not acting like them true self. The other day I think I went overboard with the rudeness and we spoke about it over text. I tried explained to them saying why I act this way and after that we kind of resolved it but I still feel like I didn't make them 100% happy. What can I do to stop being rude? 
4	I also wanted to say, this doesn't happen often. It doesn't happen at all. Being rude doesn't define who I am but it's hard trying to keep everyone happy. This situation was my fault tho and I am not happy with myself about it and I don't want something like that to happen again. I tried giving constructive criticism but I don't think that worked out well also. 
1	[deleted]
-7	Lol u not ISFP. They don’t care for shit like this unless when directly triggered like when u tryna hit them or fuck them up.
4	How to call someone out when necessary?	I won’t go into a lot of detail because I don’t think it’s necessary, but there’s been this person that hasn’t been the kindest to me (I’m a senior btw). He was extremely rude to me and basically made fun of me really passive aggressively in front of the whole class. I really wanted to say something to him after because he’s supposed to be my friend (long story) but I became so anxious that I just couldn’t. I keep telling myself that I shouldn’t create an issue and that maybe it’s actually somehow me who’s in the wrong. I know ISFPs generally hate conflict, so do you guys have any advice?\n\nI didn’t put a lot of detail for brevity’s sake, but I’m happy to answer any clarifying questions.
4	my weapon of choice would be joking :) while feigning hurt, i would say something along the lines of, "Really? You had to say that in front of the whole class? How you gonna do me like that man? That was mean...I thought we were friends :'(" \n\nthis is my go-to method for minor gripes.\n\nthough ISFPs are conflict-averse, they can be direct about things that matter to them. personally i'm not afraid of firm call-outs or straight up confronting someone if it's something i really feel strongly about. \n\na firmer approach would be to say kindly but firmly, "You humiliated me in front of the whole class and I really don't think that's okay, regardless of what your intentions were." best case, he actually didn't know any better and genuinely feels sorry and stops being so rude to you. \n\nif he continues to be rude to you then it's time to consider marie kondoing him out of your life because ain't nobody got time for that :)
2	Laugh along as if you're going with it and then say loudly "wow *SOMEONE'S jealous*" in an exaggerated way while looking at him and smirking. Anything he says just clap back, talk over him, interrupt him, anything. Practice in the mirror if you have to. And keep the crowd on your side. Everyone knows he's being an asshole but you gotta call it. 
28	Is anyone else not especially romantic?	I’ve never cared too much about whether or not I’ve been in a relationship or not. I always loved Valentine’s Day bc I thought that pink and red were a seriously underrated color combo, while everyone else complained about being single. If anything, relationships seem more trouble than what they’re worth. I feel more at ease in my own company, and I often feel boxed in and constrained by other people. Is this an ISFP thing or is this just a me thing?
8	I feel like what you're describing has little to do with romance, and more being single and having personal freedom. I dislike romance as in candlelight dinners, buying flowers, making grand gestures, but I very much do like being in a relationship (or rather, I know that not being in one would not be good for me). And luckily, I'm in a relationship that respects the need for personal freedom.\n\nSo, if you could have a relationship that allows you your freedom, and that does not require romantic gestures from you, would you still prefer to go it alone? 
6	Yes, I feel like this too. Even if I'm in a relationship I still feel the need to be myself and do my own things. In that sense I think relationships can hold me down
3	I’m not romantic in a classical sense,  but I do\n*love* love in a logical and sensual way. I love being cuddled up and talking shit to by boyfriend simultaneously if that makes sense 😂
2	Same. I can be romantic, but it's usually in very short bursts. I really hope I don't end up marrying someone someday because it's highly likely that I'd regret it the next day or so.
2	Yeah I don't really wanna get married till I reach my own goals first. But if I do meet that special someone before I reach my goals then idk. I've never been in a relationship however I used to like this girl and she liked me back however I took too long and she doesn't like me anymore. I liked her for a while but I don't care much now. I doubt I will ever meet someone like her again but oh well. But yh I wanna travel the world boii let's go, I'm not eager to get myself into a relationship. My friends call me a free spirit :) 
1	I feel like I'm difficult to get to know in the dating phase. I like to spend a lot of time by myself making music, mixes/playlist and editing videos because my job is exhausting socially. I don't text or call my date very often and that can be misconstrued as me having little to no interest in the other person. I can't date extroverts because they have to have constant attention and need to text all day every single day and it just tires me out. Sometimes I'm really interested, but I just don't know what to say or how to initiate conversation. However if I do really get to know someone and like what I see I tend to ruin the relationship because I want to be around them a lot even if I'm not talking to them (just be in the same space).\n\nI don't know relationships don't tend to work out for me. I unintentionally ghost in the beginning (they lose interest because I don't text/call back quick enough) or they ghost me later on because they think I've suddenly become clingy. I'm hoping my current dating situation works out :)
1	I completely relate, but also disagree. I actually really do enjoy being single, and relationships seem like a lot of work. Valentine’s Day just feels like another day to me; I don’t love it or hate it. I’ve never been very open about my emotions, and grand romantic gestures make me cringe so I can’t see myself ever being especially interested in anything like that.\n\n*That being said*, because I’m so comfortable being single and never make an effort to show my interest, I’m about to turn 18 and have never even been on a date. I have a lot of friends (and most of my close friends are guys), I’m funny and friendly, I’m not especially ugly, I’m smart and have hobbies and talents and ambitions and *blah blah blah* but because I’m so uncomfortable with romance, I’ve never even experienced it. I genuinely do like being single most of the time, and I like having independence and freedom and being able to make life choices without needing to consider how they would effect a significant other. But sometimes I do wish I’d at least experienced being in a relationship, and everything that goes with it. I’m definitely not romantic, but I really wish I was sometimes, because I feel like I’m completely just blocking out an entire chunk of life.
6	ISFPs – how do you feel about the combination of weed and music, or art in general?	Let me preface this by saying that I didn't know my MBTI-type until recently, and I didn't really care all that much and I still don't, but there have been one or two small revelations. My university recently made the results from our selection tests public, and apart from some formal maths stuff, intelligence and logic tests they apparently also ran a MBTI test, and apparently I'm ISFP, which explains a couple of things or habits that my friends have been pointing out for quite some time now – for example the fact that I love to find "beautiful things" everywhere I go. Whether we're in the woods or walking through the city I'll often go "Hey, doesn't that look really nice?" – well, I guess that explains why I tend to see those things more than other people.\n\nMore to the point though, music is my life. I have been making music since I was six years old and I listen to everything, but mainly I think Progressive Rock is the best thing in the world. Now, two years ago some friends got me into trying weed and one thing I quickly noticed is that music gets EVEN BETTER. I mean, movies and other forms of art as well, but music is something different when I'm high. I have been told by other people that music is pretty relaxing when they're stoned, but I don't think anyone I know ever "feels" the music like I do. Does anyone here have similar experiences?
1	I feel ya brotha 
1	I feel the same as you do about music and stuff. I listen all the time and write and play music. Its weed that doesnt sit right with me. Any time ive gotten high i have a terrible time and one time when i listened to music and it made it sound lifeless and empty and terrible. It was really quite a bad time. Plus it caused me a week of psychosis after i stupidly ate an edible one time knowing that weed doesnt sit right with me. Anyway I stay away from the stuff.
1	Yess!!! Hell yess, music when high takes me to another level completely. Stretches out time as well, like a 4 minute song feels like a lifetime and I can feel the layers of music. I listen to Indie a lot. Bands like The XX.
1	I'm against using drugs for myself, goes against my morals I guess. I love music and appreciate the beauty of our world though
1	Yeah I feel that. Weed makes music everything. 
1	One thing I noticed is that weed really makes me get hung up on certain parts of songs. Like I'll notice something I never noticed before and have to repeat the section 2 or 3 more times. In a way it makes it harder for me to sit back and enjoy the music, but it will also make me appreciate the artists a lot more for the creative and subtle stances they take in the writing process. 
3	Ideas for my ISFP wife	Good morning, I have been trying to type my wife lately, and I believe that she is an ISFP based on the eight cognitive functions. My only concern is that we have never really done anything artistic. I would like to give her the opportunity to explore that aspect of her personality (perhaps on a date), but I am unsure about the best way to do this. Do you guys have any suggestions? Are any of you lovely people also non-artistic ISFPs. I am an ENFP, so extroverted sensing is my worst cognitive function; so I am very out of my element here. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: I would like to clarify that my wife is an amazing writer and has an awesome blog. So she doesn't lack artistic talent, but I want to give her the chance to use all of her senses in different ways.
3	Hmmmm... how about a coffee art course or crafts workshop? There's no reason why you can't join in and learn some artistic skills of your own.  \n\nidk im just throwing out ideas (ISFPs please chime in if I am off-base)
3	Maybe take her on a nature walk and then you two can spend some time painting or taking pictures of all that you see, if you think that’s something she would enjoy.\n\nAlso, just because ISFPs are very artistic doesn’t necessarily mean that they are artsy. Sometimes they enjoy art in the form of aesthetics. For me, personally, I’m pretty awful at art, and it doesn’t hold my attention very long, but I’ve moved to places that are the most aesthetically pleasing, and I enjoying being surrounded by places that inspire me. So we don’t always need to get our artistic sides out with art, sometimes we just like being surrounded by beauty. Maybe consider taking to her to a place she would deem aesthetically pleasing.\n\nBest of luck to you! It’s super cool that you’re thinking about this aspect of her personality and wanting to take action on it.
2	I like to think of the ISFP trait as creative, not necessarily artistic (in the sense of classic studio art). Your wife’s writing definitely fits the bill. I personally like some types of creativity but not others. (I’m not into painting, but I like photo and movie editing.) I also greatly appreciate other people’s creativity and beautiful things, which I think is our sensing side. Especially from artists who think outside of the box. Also nature. \n\nMy recommendation would be to find out what new creative thing your wife is interested in trying and go in that direction. It could be that she’s interested in expressing her creativity through dancing, making studio art work, playing a musical instrument, writing poetry, making a movie, making jewelry or something that could be sold on Etsy, or enjoying a really nice day outdoors (etc.)
10	ENFP Male Interviewing ISFP Male Julien McLaren Fi-Ni SC/B(P)	
3	Lol omg this made me so self conscious. Like looking in a mirror. Am I as pretentious as this guy? Probably. Shit :( and esp how the ENFP is just so clearly bored and FiNi is caught up in his concepts he doesn't know how to dial it back. This is why I don't socialise.\n\nEdit: ok but as I watch more I have to say the guy is self aware enough to realise that he isn't really doing himself favours with the tribe and I commend him for that. Coming to the same realisation myself and hoping to work on that demon Te. It's a lot of work, especially when your internal world does cloud everything... Thanks for sharing this is really helpful.\n\nEdit2: watched the whole thing, probs overreacted a little bit soz. as they say seeing your type is kind of traumatic. actually really enjoyed this conversation, both really grew on me, the ISFP is on point about how to grow from your typology blindspots and it was all really fascinating :) thanks!
5	i have a crush on my therapist	
8	She cannot accept it. It’s called transference in therapy terms. She’s caring and nurturing but that is her job. Good luck. 
3	yikes, good luck
3	Find another crush elsewhere
3	You should probably switch therapists.
3	Oof
44	I found a Japanese proverb that might be fitting for a lot of ISFPs.	花鳥風月 (Kachou Fuugetsu) Literally: Flower, Bird, Wind, Moon\n\nMeaning: Experience the beauties of nature, and in doing so learn about yourself.
5	I like this. =) I wanted to add that nature isn't always about experiencing things only in the outdoors, you can also find such pleasant natures in many things like people, music, art, objects, etc that can help define our inner world or of who we are. 
3	This is beautiful. 😌
4	Perfectly describes me! I left the big city a month ago and I feel so peaceful and I’m so much better at introspecting.
2	Amazing. I love this. 
1	What do you think?	u/thechessgoddess and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count moral obligations out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded. This is a place to express yourself, after all. 
3	one, because morals have no objective basis in reality. you don't usually kill people because it feels wrong, but if you'd be better off with them dead and are only thinking rationally, there's no issue\n\nother than two, which is that there are typically very harsh punishments for murderers. it's a pretty dumb question though, there's a lot more to discuss about the moral aspects of killing another person
5	Can ISFPs be Highly Sensitive Persons (HSPs)?	I'm wondering what this would look like with 2nd slot Se. 
1	Maybe? Do you feel you might be both of those things? If so, what traits do you have that lead you to believe you might be both? I’m as unsure as you are, so it would be cool to unpack this and see.
1	Yes they can. 
1	Yes they definitely can depending on what they've experienced in their life. I don't know if I would consider myself an HSP, but I guess I fit the bill. I do find myself inside my head often analyzing various situations and scenarios that often turn out not be as convoluted or bad as I imagined. I feel and pick up on people's emotions almost instantly and I am immensely affected by my environment. I also need lots of downtime and I abhor violence and cruelty in real life, but not in video games or movies (I play mortal kombat and watch horror/thrillers all the time).
1	Yep. And it's a nightmare.
-2	Nah they are just emotional
6	how much of you can be taken away before you can no longer call yourself you?	
6	Great question. \n\nAs things are taken away, new input comes in to replace it and/or the older pieces grow to fill the empty space. \n\nWe are always ourselves.
2	There's a great story in the beginning of John Dies at the End about a hatchet. One day the handle breaks, and a new handle is attached. Not long later, the blade breaks, so a new one is attached to the old-new handle. Is it the same hatchet? \n\nIt ends there but here's how I take it. Now, as a collective of materials, it isn't the same at all. But as a construct with a purpose, it is absolutely the same as before. So are you a collective of materials, or a construct with a purpose? \n\n&#x200B;
2	Nothing can take you away from yourself. Even if someone can temporarily blunt your personality it will always comeback or you will fight against them and claim it back. Sometimes the not so great parts of our personality need to go away so that they can be replaced with better aspects learned through wisdom and life experience. You will always be true to yourself however. I've seen people change a lot over time for better or for worse (depending on how they handle things), but I've never seen someone's personality do a full 360. 
15	I will find a way.	I've just wake up at 3 AM and I'm unable to fall asleep again. My mind started its routine of bombarding myself with concerns. In a few days I start my 3rd year of my career, and still can't imagine how will I get money after classes for food and books. I would simply get more anxious by wondering why my boss sudenly fired me last month and by telling me how unable I am, but I prefer to think that, as always, I will find a way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't go hollow.
8	Very similar problems here man. Lost my job 2 weeks ago, rents due in less than a week and I haven't even payed this month's yet, and I still need to buy an online access code to take an exam this week because Ive been coasting off the trial version until now. I've been in this situation a few times before, I don't know how I keep letting myself get into tight spots like this. But yes, we will find a way
5	I believe in you guys. Keep working hard
2	Dont be too proud to seek help. Figuring it out doesnt have to be a one lane road. In the words of Carrie Underwood. I believe we were made to be here for each other.\nBe safe friend. Don't you dare go hollow.
29	why are dogs and cats so fucken cute	
3	Just because they are! 
2	I can't wait till I leave this swamp and I can finally get both 
2	Bc they have lil floofy tails and give snuggles
8	Are you guys really sensitive, like me, and take criticism/insults hard?	I am always aware of how i look and what I’m saying, and I’m constantly insecure over it. I also remember almost every time I’ve been insulted and still think of it.  I was insulted years ago, someone said i had teeth like spongebob and now i think of it every time I open my mouth. I take insults really hard and if someone gives me criticism, even if I ask for it, I find it hard not to burst into tears, and most of the time I do. How do I stop taking everything so personally and hard? 
2	I get annoyed as well however I forget about them very quickly. Whenever someone insults me I say to myself that they're not okay, cause normal people don't insult others for no reason. What I love doing is giving people compliments after they insult me. Their reactions are beautiful. 
2	Yeppp, I can relate. I can handle gentle constructive criticism (“hey, this is pretty good! But you might want to fix this...”), but if someone directly criticizes me, I get my little spirit crushed lol. Overtime, I’ve started just blocking out the majority of my negative emotions, though, because I’m not good at dealing with them, so I’ve started at least *pretending* criticism/insults don’t bother me...:)
2	Whoever said that about your teeth must really have a psychological problem. They certainly said that to attack you and make you feel down, making them feel a whole lot better about themselves. It seems the problem lies with them, not you. There are times when they do feel like personal attacks, but we don't have to take it that way. You can either choose to forget and ignore it or consider it in a positive way or action for your self benefit. Like while looking into the bathroom mirror, "My Spongebob teeth look hella fine on me. Who cares what anyone else says. No one else can pull that off better than me. \*smiles"  You could even have been the better person and thanked them for the compliment. I think Spongebob's teeth are actually cute tbh. He takes extra attention and care of them and are usually, always pearly white. Spongebob isn't Spongebob without those nice teethes of his. You really shouldn't let things like that get to your head unless you truly believe them to be. \n\nI know that there are times even when it's hard and I can't take those things in well or it doesn't sit well with me. But I try not to let it get me down and bother me. I don't want those things to weigh me or drag me down in any negativity form long term. Don't give in to the pain forever because you can be so much better than that. Those things do not define who I am. I know what I am. Sometimes, I ponder and try to see the meaning behind said things. Why did they say those things to me? What do I need to improve on if I do see where they are coming from? What could I do differently to overcome this? Does this person even know or are aware of what they're saying? If they just want to make themselves feel better, ignore them if you can. But if they criticize you and want to help support you by telling you what things to improve on, you can take that as someone who is trying to help you better yourself in a good way, not that they want to look down on you or anything like that.  Sometimes I just need a little time or space to make me alright again. Even a quiet, comforting hug will do or talking to someone about it can help ease the burdening weight. A person once told me not to take things too personally to heart and I'm still learning ways to take what that caring person said, to heart. It really boils down to how you take it in. These things are inevitable and just takes some time and how you go about treating the conflicting issue. \n\nI hope that this will make you feel better, can be an eye opener for you and possibly help you in some ways. =) 
3	Looking for some good playlists	I usually listen to soundcloud and youtube but not spotify.\n\nThese are some of the playlists I listen to. All of my music in the soundcloud list is in my likes.\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOEvyC6mknLZH_0n9AU8ulpzm1-QI7yXX)\n\n[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-804042698)
2	That's my playlist:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/22oh6llruwbby57xcdhotmkfy/playlist/6CCHaZ0exmugd7ooUpaRty?si=3JqJ1xGxQoicCuEnLhoEGw\nI like it,dunno if you're gonna enjoy it but it doesn't hurt to try
2	My playlists are mostly indie but feel free to explore https://open.spotify.com/user/emacietti?si=lsvSXZSkRvSBEQJZWweRzg
10	ISFPs, how do I deal with this situation?	Okay, so I’m an INTP female seeing an ISFP male. \n\nI don’t really know where to start, so I’ll start with saying that I really like him - like, a lot. I’ve been getting to know him for the past 7/8 months, and it’s not much that we meet. During those 7/8 months, things have been very up and down - despite not seeing each other more than twice a week (if lucky).\n\nHe’s hard to get to know, but I am willing to take all the time in the world. He’s had a tough past with his mum and his ex, and I know that it still plays a big part in how he is now. \n\nThe dynamic between us is romantic and sweet, however I found out that a few days ago, his grandmother passed away. I messaged him as soon as I found out, sharing my condolences and told him that I’m here for him. He replied saying “thank you means so much x” and that’s it.\n\nI know he wants space, but I really and genuinely want to be there for him. I miss and and love him.\n\nSo, ISFPs, how do I go about being there for him and showing him that I’m there for him, without him feeling like I’m too ‘needy’?
13	Please go anyways and be there for him. We tend to push people away when we need it the most.
5	Be there, but don't push your support on him.
5	Turn up with some food like chocolates. He’ll invite you in if he wants company if not you’ve made a nice gesture. 
4	My fiancé is an intp, and I’m an isfp. I can go ahead and tell you that our personalities make for a great relationship! For me, so much of my emotions deal with my senses. \n\nYou could message him saying that you understand if he wants space, but if he wanted to get out of the house, then you all could go for a walk through the park. I think it’s a good idea to offer your presence, but be okay if he chooses space. \n\nI have issues dealing with stress. It’s nice to have someone there, but I don’t like anything to feel forced. \n\nI hope everything works out for the very best!!! 
7	made a playlist while i was tired	and i mean tired tired. been awake for 20 hours straight. why? don't ask.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkz6DRbv7wtAEP1h8MtW5I1S
2	Why were you awake for 20 hours straight? Sleep is important my guy
2	Does anyone else here like ESFJs?	Asking from fellow ISFPs. In my opinion they would be the perfect partner for us to have carefree fun/do creative endeavours with and have a close friendship with. They're stable, supportive, loyal and caring. I've had a long close friendship with an ESFJ (I still keep in touch with her sometimes) and it was amazing. Also, Si generally seems like a somewhat misunderstood function to me. What are your thoughts on/experiences with ESFJs?\n\nedit: on a side note, types that I've felt most energized hanging around with were ESFJs and ISTPs.
3	Yeahp, they are really fun and easy to be around.\n\nBut i have no clue on how NE child works. Or sort of how to use it to my favor. Is it simple as just saying you like them or saying what you want? 
2	All of the ESFJs that I've had experience with are very set in their ways, which isn't a problem, until they talked down on the way that I view things. I love being around them in short bursts though!
1	I loooove ESFJs, from a slight distance. When they’re really close to me, they can make me a tad crazy, especially because a lot of ESFJs I’ve met (not all!) have really strings ideas of social norms that everyone needs to follow, and they’ll kind of be passive aggressive in their judgement towards people who don’t fit social norms. Overall they’re usually very sweet, and they tend to kind of take care of me, which is nice since I’m usually the one taking care of all of my friends. Also, they’re way better at time management and help me keep my sh*t together:). I think in general, I love ExFxs, but of the ExFxs, ESFJs are probably my least favorite.
1	My long term girlfriend is an ESFJ and we get along really well. She is really affectionate and loyal, yet gives me my own space when I need it. We get along better than any of my previous girlfriends, who have generally been introverts.  She also is great at helping me get my shit together when it comes to planning, organizing and cleaning. 
1	No.
4	which piece of technology do you find yourself using the most?	smartphone here 👋
7	Smartphone
4	woven clothes.\n\ni know, i know, I'm sorry! 
2	PC and tablet.
2	Anyway, Smartphone 
2	Any technology I can use to play The Sims (4)
1	Computer 
1	Smartphone and Switch!
1	Fortnite
5	ISFPs, if you're interested in something do you stop everything to learn it?	Right now my interest in mbti is through the roof such that I'm spending my entire sunday. I haven't eaten lunch or showered/brushed my teeth and it remains doubtful whether I will at all today or in the next few days. I'm in the zone. I'm learning about each type and creating grids in my notebook.. it's almost how I get when I'm working on art, but it's like.. informational art. Is this a typical ISFP experience of learning stuff? But it makes me wonder where learning has its place in the functions? Te inferior?\n\nFull disclosure, I am learning this stuff because I don't want to be blindsided by my trickster Ne ever again, esp with just not bothering to learn and predict other people's intentions. I am motivated to be able to learn to type people and understand how to make them comfortable and avoid ppl with nefarious intentions, my biggest struggle in life being relationships.
10	Please remember to brush your teeth dude. You only get one set of 'em. Gotta take care of them.
3	I remember a time when I spent like 14hrs creating a race track for some racing game. 
2	I think you’ll find it’s normal for ISFP’s, I do exactly the same thing when I really get into something new and I’ll make entire spreadsheets and constantly talk about it, I’ve even been known to cancel plans to continue working on it, for me it’s like a sense of satisfaction. 
1	Whenever I am creating art or grinding for some rare armor/weapon in a game, you bet your ass the only thing I'm gonna be doing is leaving my seat for bathroom breaks only. 
1	Yeah I did the same. Was obsessed with it for over a year. Then I realized my reason for learning it was not really to learn it but rather to use it understand myself better/explain myself. Sounds like you've identified a similar reason helping you improve relationships. \n\nSo yeah I think Te plays a role, especially in the charts you're drawing in your notebook, lol. And our being ok with putting people into 16 boxes. But it's probably mostly Fi feeding the obsession.
1	sometimes I focus on one thing for hours until it's done, other times I'll go back and forth on a project for days, maybe even months, adding a few things here and there. 
12	ISFP gamers! What types of video games do you enjoy playing?	I personally like RPG and strategy games.
6	Minecraft! I also really loved Portal. 
4	bioshock series, life is strange, stardew valley, borderlands 2 if i’m playing with my friends, runescape bc i still live in 2007 (even tho i play rs3...)\n\ni have a lot more on my “to play” list. like a LOT more. but not much time to play them rn 
3	Fighting games, platformers, some fps games
3	Sims, Minecraft, ark, house flipper, audio surf 2, Mario kart, ssx, zoo tycoon, animal crossing, 
2	I really like RPG too. BioWare games and Kingdom Hearts are my favorite 
2	Same as you 😊
2	I can't stop going back to the Dragon Age series recently. I really loved Origins and Inquistion. I also love Persona and Final Fantasy games. I guess I'm an rpg fan. \n\nAs for online games, I've been playing LoL, Overwatch, and Maplestory. \n
2	Don’t play much anymore but I used to love WoW, I was the best guild master ever. Lately I’ve been working on finishing fallout 3 😂
2	The games I love the most are games which have a fantastic set of characters; they’re really what I remember the most from a game rather than the story or gameplay. Games like the Mass Effect series and Chrono Trigger have a special place in my heart for this very reason.
2	Ive been playing Dota for like 13 years. Had a brief LoL stint. Then there is alot. Played WoW, diablo 2, dungeon seige, serious sam, bioshock, Deus ex, witcher 2&3, portal, half life, CoD, battle feild, borderlands 2, need for speed, age of empires, C&C generals, warcraft 3, assassin's Creed 2-4, lotr battle for middle earth. There are a lot more. \n\nSoo I enjoy playing games. Any rpg with a decent story, and shooters and driving games for stress relief. But I mainly just play Dota 2 now. I do enjoy playing with a friend more than playing alone. 
2	JRPG (Dragon Quest, Xenogears, Final Fantasy, Disgaea, etc), Metroidvania (Mega Man Zero and ZX, Castlevania, etc), Hack n Slash (God of War, Metal Gear Rising, Dead Rising) and pretty much anything with an anime aesthetic like Danganronpa and other VNs.
2	I enjoyed playing God of War series as well as marvel vs capcom. Also liked dota, red alert 2, Diablo 3. 
2	I usually only play RPGs like Skyrim, Witcher or RDR2, with a dash of FPS every once in a while. I also really like JRPGS
2	Any RPG where my decisions in the game actually have an effect on what happens, and its not just a different route to the same ending.
2	I only play Stardew Valley so idk if that makes me a gamer but my 400+ hours on there speaks for itself.
1	Fighting games and games with alot of exploration. I find street fighter and melee lots of fun and I love to endlessly explore in tloz breath of the wild
1	I can enjoy almost any kind of genre but my enthusiasm doesn't always last so long. My favorite series tend to be action rpgs like Skyrim or the Witcher, sandboxes like GTA and rdr, or sports/simulation type games

15	as an adult male ISFP, this is how my desktop looks like.	
5	Me gusta, aesthetic and minimalistic 
1	My desktop only has like 4 icons of games I never play bc Steam auto-added them. It's only clean bc I don't use my desktop, though; home directory and Documents are a shitstorm where some folders may be generic dumping zones while others may be nested down so far and precisely that there's only like 1 file per subfolder, and there's little logic or reason to which extreme of specificity any given directory may have.
8	Do you find it hard to open up to people?	I find it extremely hard, I have lots of friends and people I’m cool with however there’s only like 2 or 3 people I’m my true self with. Is this bad? How do you open up to people?
2	yes, I don't open up to people right away- usually takes a while. I used to be very shy and didn't even mess around or joke with people I didn't know, but now I try to joke with everyone a little bit if I can.
1	I don't think theres anything wrong with that. You don't have to open up to anyone. The way I look at it. Its really hard to hurt my feelings because I don't open up to people unless I know damn well they aren't gonna hurt me. I'm by no means fragile, but inviting people I don't know to well to get to know me sounds like a bad idea. You're just protecting yourself.\n\nI likewise only have 3 or 4 people who I let get to know me. Frankly thats only because they stuck around for long enough. I guess whatever charm my ISFP profile puts off kept them around. Real glad it did too.
1	Lol yeah, I don’t open up easily at all. I have a lot of friends, but we tend to talk about superficial things. I only have like 2 friends in the entire universe I’ll actually talk to about personal things.
3	this playlist is dedicated to my best friend, jimmy	he was the one who got me into anime and he introduced me to different music styles that i haven't heard of before. i combined all the songs together that hold the most significance to me.🖤\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkx_TUZ914hQ0lTn1p8CvB35
1	it even has the funny chinese rap song that he would play. i remember when he jumped onto my skype call when my league crew were in a game and blasted it at max volume. it was hilarious.
7	People say that I'm boring cause I'm too nice	I mean what a great insult haha. Any other isfps get similar comments? 
7	Whoever has the gall to say something that negative to you isn’t someone you should listen to at all. Healthy, happy people don’t feel the need to put others down. I’m sure you are plenty interesting and being nice is not a bad thing at all. 
4	To answer your question, I haven’t ever been told I’m too nice, but I’ve had people criticize plenty of other things about me and wish I were more *this* or more *that*. I think our type can frustrate people because of all of our potential we hold, and all of our talents and deep thoughts we have. People see these great things and tend to want to suggest ways for you to use them best. But it’s usually not even wanted advice (our type could give fuck all what someone else thinks we should do) and can come off as rude and annoying. 
1	Hes jealous
1	Gotta love insults disguised as shitty compliments. People have told me they think its a waste that I use my enormous brain to devise genius ways to get away with being so fucking lazy and worthless.
1	Their loss bro. Negative people will always find something to give something a hard time about, even if it doesn't really even make any sense.
1	I used to get this all the time when I was younger. My advice is to work on your individuality and authenticity, but also work on developing your confidence through self development books. \n\nAfter growing and developing my "self" I stopped getting "boring" and started getting comment like "real", "down to earth" sometimes even intense (I give full attention to the person I'm with)
5	Survey on personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
4	I feel like whoever designed this quiz doesn’t flirt a lot. For example, there were some weird suggestions on there concerning “flirtatious behavior” (like touching someone’s neck or sucking them off...) but obvious ones like “biting your lip”  and “playing coy” were never mentioned.\nSimilarly with the emojis. Never in my history of dating did I send someone a *scared barfing emoji* or 95% of the others shown...but the ones I always used, like 💕😍❤️👄💋💅🏼🥰 👠 weren’t listed as options?

1	Deep pottery
15	Does anyone else find INTJs friendlier than ISTJs, generally speaking?	For some reason I find that most ISTJs appear rather grumpy and distant, and I often get the impression that I'm constantly being judged. Don't have this at all with INTJs.
8	That’s because you share all the same functions as INTJ, just in a different order.\n\nINFP would probably find ISTJs more approachable than INTJ, for example.
6	Nah, I wouldn’t say so.\n\nEdit: I’m intj\n\nEdit: married to an isfp
6	So my husband is an intj and my mil is an istj. I get along with both. I feel like with istj is that they are very black and white on things. With intj I feel like there is lots a room for the grey area. You can reason and talk about your views. I feel like with istj they already know what they think and it’s very hard to change it. Which might make them look grumpy. 
3	I get along super well with INTJ's. So, yeah. 
3	Totally agree.
18	How do you show affection for others?	I’m not very openly affectionate. I’ve learned as I’ve gotten older to make myself say “I love you” occasionally and give compliments to my friends often so they know I don’t hate them. But I’ve noticed that, in general, I tend to make fun of the people I truly care about. Not “you’re ugly” kind of making fun, but more like copying someone’s voice if they say something weird or teasing them about something.\n\nAnyways, I’ve always kind of pushed people away a lot, and it JUST occurred to me that when I’m “teasing” my friends, they might not be interpreting it the way I intend. I usually bond with others over humor, and NEVER being up things I know people are insecure about or make fun of impressions or accents or whatever. But I’m worried others might think I’m picking at them just to pick at them (and not because I love them lol) and get irritated with me. \n\nI’m just curious, is there anything strange you guys do to show that you care about the people in your life, or are you pretty straightforward with your affection?
4	Im the same as you. I think teasing is just an easier way to talk to people when we are not too close with a certain person, but care about them. Its like a way to mask my own insecurity of getting rejected I think.  Usually, once the other person shows the same signs of caring or wanting to know each other better, then I'll reciprocate by being more serious. 
4	This is heaps relatable to me -- I'm also very teasing with people I love, as long as I can tell they'll know that I'm just teasing. With my friends, it's pretty much just that on top of doing stuff for them that shows I care about them, like giving them rides when they need it or helping them clean their kitchen or something. 
3	If I'm really close (like basically just my little family, 2 kids and husband), then it's easy for me.  I'm always showing love, affection and praise.    It's harder with other friends and family that are outside of my protected little family bubble.  I guess I just feel the safest here at home, it's hard to be vulnerable with other people. 
3	If I am close to someone I show it through availability and reliability more than anything else. If you're looking for company I am only a phone call away. I'll be there to save the day. Superman has got nothing on me.
1	We roast each other in my family to show love. My best friend is very affection and gives lots of praise and love, this was hard for me to adapt to and I am uncomfortable a lot of the times giving or receiving affection from her. We’ve been friends for 3+ years and she’s hugged me like 3? Times? I’m not here for it. But she’s super picky and I used to roast/tease her for it all the time until she told me it really hurt her feelings. Love languages are hard. 
10	Thoughts on a ISFJ (25F) and ISFP (34M) relationship?	I’ve been dating this wonderful ISFP for about four months now and I’ve really fallen for him. His sensuality and laid back nature is unmatched by anyone else I’ve ever been with. I feel like I fall into such a relaxed trance when I’m with him, forgetting about all my worries and anxieties. As someone who is constantly overthinking everything, this is an *amazing* feeling. \n\nWondering if anyone has opinions on this matching? I feel like we are great for each other and excellent compliments. Often times I have to drag out of him the things he likes about me and us. He would much rather communicate those things using his eyes or body (which he does so well), but I love to hear words every now and again. We both have very busy schedules right now and he makes a consistent effort to come spend time with me, which I really appreciate.\n\nWhat do you all think about ISFJs? What do you like and dislike? 
2	I'm a 27 year old male ISFP with a 53 year old ISFJ dad. He is a good dad, very stoic though and old fashioned, he believes in traditions and history and the-way-things-are-done, which I absolutely hate.\n\nThe things I like about him are the groundedness and stability. I respect the way he puts family before himself and has a strong relation with the community. This is something I could never expect that from myself. I don't operate this way.\n\nISFP and ISFJ are polar opposites, our priorities are very very different (cognitively). Every function that one has, the other has as shadow functions. In my opinion, there would be a lot of arguments and disagreements, but if there is equal levels of respect (typically ISFJs would find it difficult to respect ISFPs, but also vice versa) then it would be a lot to learn from each other, and you could cover each others weaknesses
2	Ive been with an isfj female and Im isfp so heres my point of view. In general, it was hard for both of us to open up and communicate freely about our feelings because she needed affirmation, but I did too. We Isfp's also tend to overthink everything and worry. The best solution I see is to make him naturally express more by showing more expression from yourself. He wont do anything out of his comfort zone if he doesnt see it being necessary. Right now he probably is not completely comfortable with expressing everything but itll probably come sooner or later in the future. If you want to step it up though, I would give him affirmation so you could naturally get a response from him.
1	If that relaxed feeling fades what do you have? Honest question\n\nHe might still be the same guy but you have more worries now and he can't keep up so then you have nothing to fall back on\n\nIt's great you feel this way but you have to plan for more otherwise it could fade.\n \nPeople, like with food, get caught up in the taste and how it feels but what happens after we eat that whole pizza? Nothing but an empty wallet and diabetes\n\nTldr Sounds like a good guy, don't just connect in one area
1	This is the same as my gf (ISFJ) and I (ISFP). I'l try to give you my perspective. \n\nWe fell for each other hard as well, since when we first started dating our lives matched up so well. She's known both by her family members and friends as the "anxious" one, but when she's around me she's very lovey-dovey and relaxed. I do make a consistent effort to be with her, and I think the time we spend together is how we tell each other we love each other. I don't tell her often enough how much I like to be around her, which frustrates her sometimes and it seems like you dislike it too lol. Just figure that if I'm hanging around, I'm having a good time. \nIn my opinion, I think that there's enough give and take between our personality types to keep the relationship fresh and consistently good. What I have found is the key is expressing how and why we feel a certain way (ASAP) to each other to avoid confrontation
5	What makes you happy? :)

5	Football(soccer), drawing, piano, photography, music
6	to be entertained, free time and freedom of choice, people who don't hate me or judge me, groupal activities like drawing, playing videogames, or any other type of game and fun activities.
5	My dogs \n
6	Everything. I'm easy to make happy

3	Freedom
2	Good anime and games, quality time with friends and family and good food.
2	spending time with good friends, also drawing/painting and exercise
2	That tiny little squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together.
25	[Meta] Suggestion: Tell your age when asking a question	I see a lot of posts that I'd like to offer my 2 cents on, but can't quite estimate what stage of life OP is in. Because you don't want to give a 17 year old the same advice you'd give to a 25 year old. I think this would be a very productive new rule. Asking for advice on the internet isn't as straightforward as people think. I truly appreciate seeking advice from people who view the world from a very similar lens, but without some details about the person's specific situation, I think those posts can not foster a healthy and productive discussion where we can all learn from each other.\n\nWhat do you guys think?
4	Yhh that's a great idea
4	Best idea everrrrr
2	Totally agree with this! 
2	Why wouldn't you give a 17 year old and 25 year old the same advice? In many cases they probably could both apply the same advice, depending on the situation. I think people make too many assumptions about others based on age alone, so I don't normally tell people my age unless it's relevant, which it usually isn't. People don't always neatly fit into "life stages" boxes. It also greatly depends on which country they live in. 
1	You are a genius.
20	Do you get annoyed when people act fake?	Personally this is one of the things that pisses me off the most. 
12	Yup. 
3	Yes. Yes yes yes yes. 
3	One of my biggest pet peeve. 
3	Omg yes I hate it so much
3	It’s the worst 
2	Few things piss me off more.
2	Yes!!!
2	well as Fi doms we value authenticity so yes most of us hate it
1	Does this include fake smiles?  Like, maybe I just don't want to be somewhere that I have to be.  If yes, then I'm a total hypocrite.
1	Who doesn't?  
1	Yeppp. Especially when people are very clearly try to portray a *certain* image 🤢.
1	Yes! My absolute pet peeve! 
7	How do you ISFPs guys approach a girl? Girls help me out too	Any tips or advice for me if I ever wanna talk to a girl but I'm too shy or don't know what to say. 
6	Hey brutha, just don't take rejection too seriously. Im much of a pussy myself too and I know its hard, but thats just who we are. We just gotta fight our fears. We gotta beat it one by one and eventually itll be easier. Practice makes perfect, ya know? Get rejected instead of missing your chance. Youll regret missing your chances more. Good luck to you brutha
4	For me, what's helped me a lot is realizing all girls, regardless of attractiveness, are just humans. Any female you idealize/fantasize have a bunch of cons and negatives to them you can't see. Just because they've made their face and hair, put their best cute self in public, doesn't mean they are the right girl for you. There's lots of crazy, boring, incompatible girls out there. The more girls you talk to, you will become more selective and relax when you approach girls. 
2	I'm really passive and usually just wait for them to show some interest in me before I ask them out or whatever. I'm not hugely successful since most women won't approach men, but that's just how it is. Sometimes i'm a little more proactive and will go up and talk to them first, but that can be hard depending on what setting you're in\n\nThe girl I like now has talked to me a little bit, next time I see her I'll probably just ask her a question about something and see how it goes from there. \n\nI definitely agree with the poster below - just think of them as regular people, because that's what they are. 
6	If you could have one thing that you wear all the time, what would it be?	
6	Definitely my glasses.
5	We wouldn't want that. Variety is the spice of life.
3	A watch. More people should wear them. They look good. If you get a nice one anyway. Those crappy $20 dollars watch you can get at a supermarket look trashy.
3	A great boiler suit, it’s my current sewing goal.
2	Socks, I don't like seeing of showing feet
2	My bomber jacket. Looks cool, many pockets, comfortable. 
2	I only own 2 identical pairs of pants so I actually do wear the same thing all the time.
2	Nicely fitting jeans.
1	my white tshirt 
1	I’ve always been intrigued by the idea of having a personal uniform, like Steve Jobs. I love aesthetics and design, but I feel like choosing clothes in the morning is such a hassle. I would wear my navy blue San Francisco sweat shirt (that fits perfectly) everyday. I already wear skinny jeans, vans, and dark gray or black nail polish (almost!) every day. I like to dress *nicely*, I.e. stuff needs to fit well and suit my style, but overall, I don’t care much, and tend to put more effort into my hair/makeup.
1	Tanktops ! 
9	Am I ISFP if I’m okay with tradition and commitment?	I’m trying to work out my personality type and I’ve gone through my cognitive functions and stuff and I’m pretty sure I’m an ISFP. It seems to fit pretty well except for two things: tradition and commitment. I’m okay with things being progressive however, as a Catholic, I value tradition as well. I also kind of like structures since they help me be more productive when I would otherwise waste my time (like school schedules). I also really value commitment, especially in relationships. Are these breaking points for being an ISFP?\n\nEDIT: I also get “vibes” from people. I don’t put TOO much stock in them, but I get them nonetheless. Ahh this is so complicated to figure out!
5	I believe you think of the types too much as stereotypes. Yes, it is okay to be an ISFP and value commitment and tradition, but not merely because ISFPs tend to be loyal and value their friendships highly, but because this is what most of humans do. Even as an introvert you still need good people around you to give you energy.\nAnd when it comes to tradition, I think everyone who can understand the value of it can respect it, regardless of their type.
6	It's ok to not fit your type's description %100. But if %80 of it sounds like someone secretly has been listening to your mind for your entire life, then you know that's the one. /u/ravetildawn said it right, we're actually very committed people, but we're just very picky with what we chose to commit to. \n\nAs far as traditions, I think there's a part of us that can chose to go upstream and completely against a trend/tradition/standard when we can't get un board with it. And we rebel in our own style, doing it differently, as the inner artists of lifestyle comes out.
10	         Okay, when it comes to commitment: ISFP’s are really loyal, and expect the same from others. I find I take my relationships (family, good friend, or romantic) seriously but, only when I see them as a potential to be serious part of my life. When I have those friends from class/work, that I never see outside of there, I could care less about them.  \n         \n         As for the traditional part, I’m not sure how to quite answer that. I can say that I do follow certain traditions, that I like to keep mostly because they’re ones my family has, not me personally. \n\n       I hope this helps at least a little! (: 
7	what about you do others find annoying?	when I'm with friends and in the moment, I tend to be a bit oblivious to my own annoying tendencies. it's not until I look back at what occurred and I realize, "oh I guess I came off as petty/self-centered/annoying/etc"\n\nfor example, I experience fomo a lot and get salty being left out of social situations, most of which are usually pretty trivial. but I tend to blow up my hurt feelings and I feel like it annoys the people around me when I keep making pointed and hurt comments because of it. another example is when I get so excited talking about myself and my own experiences that I probably make it hard for others to chime in into the conversation. or when people interject and the topic changes I'll steer it back to continue talking where I left off.\n\nself-reflection is pretty important to me but no matter how aware of my faults I am, sometimes I get too excited and still commit these above tendencies. pretty frustrating. \n\nwhat are some of tendencies that other people might find annoying? how did you overcome them? or how are you working to overcome them? 
5	Same way although I would say it has gotten better\n\nI try and talk less but say more meaningful things and realize I will always and everyone will always have fomo, it's just life\n\nGood supportive friends help 2
3	An ISFP perceiving things as they want them to be. My mother is an ISFP, and while she does mean well(seriously), she comes to believe things that never happened and are not true. She'll sit on things for a long time, somehow come to a conviction about something, and then- that's it... that's it- it's done....... decision made. At times, I would know exactly how she's feeling as after 2 decades I picked up some patterns, and when she doesn't respond to others than clearly she's upset.... but should I ask about it I know it'll give her reason to just let it out all and tell others that other people are wrong and not her(Not all the time, she would have -I felt- genuine concerns at times.) The victimization of ISFPs is very, very annoying, because their loved ones might have no idea what's even the problem should they happen to not see the ISFP for a couple days or so.\n\nAnd should she finally build up the courage to disrupt the flow of things, then she expects everyone to fall in line as it took a lot to come bother people with her problems, and that she only held back out of kindness and consideration for others...... No. Time taken out of consideration for others does not make one right. And then should anyone offer another opinion on the perspective, even my grandparents, than she reverts to a couple versions of "I can't even." Some of the things she'll say: "That's just your opinion" "Well, that's just my opinion" "It was a miscommunication(not admittance of fault, which would make the other person feel better)"... or at times she just CANNOT be in that room any longer if anyone slightly tells her No on certain days and on certain issues, and then the rest of us are like, "?????" Literally, it's a very common IFP thing to believe that the feelings are just SO CLEAR- they are not. Also, her feelings change literally every day and the rest of us don't do that, and if not for my understanding of the system and watching a David Bowie(ISFP) interview than it's likely I wouldn't bother to tell you these things. I understand that Fi will never be Fe, but it's annoying that she would never take fault through that self-righteous value system.... but if she never takes fault, why would anybody else around her?\n\nShe has an ENFJ best friend, and my mom doesn't know about MBTI(not without trying on my part though), but so often I found myself biting my tongue to not just tell her that she ought to just talk to the only person who seems to care about her(since apparently her children might as well be watching her drown to the beat of slow jazz)- the ENFJ. It's annoying that when she doesn't feel that her emotions are heard she forces them onto others instead of getting over her initial fears of confrontation; which would solve everything(at least in our family.) It's one thing to want to be left alone, to be respected, and to have one's feelings heard.... but it's an entirely other thing to force those values onto others. If you involve others then expect backlash as one knows an ISFP, at least this one, would do the exact same. Being apart of the problem will never be a solution.\n\nMany times my mother would burst out into tears when she pulls a lot of this stuff, and do you know the worst part about it all? I believe her. It hurt me, a lot. It's annoying that by an ISFP's self-righteousness that they don't realize that people actually do care about them, but that they have lives to live as well. I'm currently on the outs with my mother, have been for a little over a year now, and when my sister gets old enough she likely will be as well as she funnels deeper and deeper into her feelings. \n\nI do hope you can relate to something in this seemingly over-dramatized backstory of mine, and I wish you well in your quest for self-growth. I would not want to see an ISFP, or anyone else, reach such a point with their loved ones. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Relationship advice	Gimme any tips and advice on relationships please, have a nice day 
7	1. communication
3	Give each other some space, make time for your friends and activities that you enjoy outside the relationship. \n\nBe respectful of each others opinion and ideas because you may not always be on equal terms about everything. \n\nBe comfortable being who you are in the relationship because that will make you both happy. \n\nIf you feel something is making you feel a certain way, be calm, open and honest with each other and find some time to discuss it. \n\nAlso, to get what you want in the relationship, you should learn to give it first. Give more of what you want to receive. If you want him/her to understand you, you have to start by understanding them. If you want them to respect you, you have to start by respecting them. If you want them to show you more love, you should show and give them love. This can benefit in any sort of relationship really. 
10	Life's tough. Like, tough tough.	It feels like everything I do is just a distraction from the painful truth that life is pain. How the hell are monks able to meditate for literally hours on end? I stopped my addictions which were video games and anime, but without them I feel so alone.\n\nThis feeling of being alone is torture. It's so boring. Time is just passing me by while I achieve nothing. What is there to achieve? If I work hard and make decent money, I still won't be able to have a beautiful wife/girlfriend. I'm unattractive. \n\nI have been coping throughout my whole life. I looked up to Bruce Lee and Rey Mysterio because they were short like me. It made me feel better about myself. \n\nI pretend that I don't need women, but it's just a form of coping. "I save a lot of money from not going on dates anyway", "I can use my energy for better things", "I won't have to pay for child support when the divorce happens", "I won't have to worry about being cheated on", etc.\n\nI just want to live like I did when I was a child. Have fun and lose track of time. Days passing by so fast, but at the same time slowly. Days are passing by fast for me now, but I wish I could enjoy them more. I feel like I'm just rotting away slowly. \n\nI don't know where I'm going with this. If you can relate, then I'm sorry that you have to go through these kinds of things. It's rough. Life is like a game, but you don't get to choose the difficulty like in Kingdom Hearts. \n\nI won't give up though. I know what it is like to be at the very bottom of the hole. So depressed that you think of a plan to end it all. There was a post here that said "figure it out." I relate to that quote very much so. My goal in life is to figure it out. There is always a way out!!\n\n
10	My big tip. Get yourself 3 hobbies:\n1. To keep you fit\n2. To make you money\n3. For creative purposes\n\nYes you can have a hobby which has all 3 aspects e.g. Gardening.\nHowever at first it may be hard and you may not like the hobbies so keep changing it up till you find ones you like.\nYou may not like some at first because your not instantly good at them but remember nothing comes instantly.\nPeople (I'm one of them) easily give up nowadays and don't have proper hobbies since it's very easy to get easy dopamine from YouTube, anime, videa games etc however if you have proper hobbies with proper goals and see yourself progress it will keep you busy and happy. Hope this helps. 
3	That figure it out post was mine. Its how I live. No matter how down I get I always think those three words. The closest to hitting rock bottom I ever came was when I considered breaking my leg to get out of a deployment. Went so far as to ask a friend to do it for me. I really only asked because I knew I needed someone to talk some sense into me. Thankfully he talked me out of it. Granted. I chose someone I knew damn well wasn't gonna hurt me.\n\nReaching out for help is fine. Don't ever let yourself think that needing help makes you weak. We all need help. I'm sure Rey Mysterio and Bruce Lee needed help at some point too. I know when we find ourselves in holes it always seems easier to find a shovel than a ladder, but there is always a ladder. Sometimes you gotta dig it up though unfortunately. Find that ladder. Figure it out.\n\nAlso. Brother to brother. You probably aren't as ugly as you think you are. No homo. The human mind is significantly more critical of itself when looking in a mirror. Someone told me that a while back and it made me feel a bit better about myself.
2	(INFP) Stay strong, friend. Hopefully it'll all seem better soon.
2	Don't suppress your feelings. I know it can be painful so it's helpful sometimes to rationalize away, but from personal experience I know that connecting with your reality - the painful and the ugly - can tell you where you need to go next. Have you sought any outside help from therapy/friends/family etc. ?
2	I can completely understand where you are coming from. \n\nLast year I went through one of the most awful head spaces I have ever been in. My 2 best friends got together and shut me out, before hand we were spending every day together and then over night I was lucky to get a text response, that and with not feeling like I was progressing at work I literally felt like I deserved it, that I wasn’t liked and that I had no hope for a future. At one point I rewrote the lyrics of songs that I knew and was listening to at the time and these all references feeling alone and ending my life, I even went as far to try and quit my job on the spot so that I could go and kill my self, luckily my work wouldn’t let me and got me in contact with a councillor, I started taking depression tablets and I started seeing a therapist once a week. It took time, I remember one morning on my way to work after I moved homes as my previous one wasn’t habitable thinking, ‘I don’t want to think like this, people still need me and I actually don’t want to die, there trying to help me dig myself out of a whole’ and automatically from that day, I haven’t looked back. \n\nFast forward 6 months I don’t even have to tell myself this anymore as people always come to me! I’m no longer taking medication and I’m not seeing the therapist. I’ve made new friends and those friends I spoke about earlier have come back into my life, but I’m cautious around them now and won’t let them get too close again. I’m not saying it’s easy, but one thing we have is understanding of others and the equality that goes with it, something that I now apply to myself. One thing I think a lot of people forget. \n\nI’m sure you will get there! And I’m hoping that this may help even a tiny bit. 
2	I feel like life is often a never-ending stream of suffering and struggle. But the good things here and there mean too much to me to give up. Instead I try to look at the struggle as a way for me to get stronger.\n\nI agree with the guy who said to get three hobbies. I've recently (last six months or so) made a serious effort to get back into productive hobbies I used to enjoy and also get in shape. It has really helped.\n\nAs far as being lonely goes and thinking you're too unattractive to get a girlfriend, don't let your looks hold you back too much. Take care of yourself and try to dress well and you'd be surprised. I know I don't generally care too much about what people look like. If I like someone's personality and we have fun talking or gaming together or whatever it is we do, I will start to see things about them that I like, I.E. their eyes or their hands or their hair color. Not even that I have preferences for any of those things either it's just what I do. And I have talked to others who feel the same. \n\nMeanwhile everyone tells me I look great and I get random men hitting on me even IRL but no one I feel connected to is interested in a relationship it seems. But I've only been single the last year and a half so I figure there's lots of time for me to meet someone to be with who actually wants to be with me.\n\nAnd I bet there's lots of time for you, too! :)
27	nothing beats sleep	the silence and peace. the feeling of drifting off. no having to worry or think about anything. so relaxing.\n\nnothing to me beats sleep. 
6	sex would probably be tied. or maybe even better. who knows.
5	I used to hate sleeping. I've learned to accept it as my condition gets severely worse if I go too long without sleep. I've done about 10 days without sleep before, although that could be wrong as you lose track of time after about 5 days.\n\n 
5	It's incredible how much do I feel identified with all of your posts guys. god damn it this is like reading my diary.
2	God yes.
3	tell a secret	
14	im not actually okay
12	I don't eat the daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables
6	I don't want to invite my classmates to my discord server cause there are some really crazy stuff there.
5	I'm not actually too sure if I'm an ISFP or not. And don't I really care if I'm wrong. I just need an "anchor" because I often feel like I don't know who I am or I feel like I don't relate to myself if that makes sense.\n\nOf course I obviously don't want some personality test to define me, Of course not. It's just nice to have SOMETHING to hold on to and feel fairly secure about. Even if that means I'm living a lie...
5	I just learned I'm actually intp.
4	I’m sad
3	I never got over it.
6	(INFP) - I've never been in love with anyone except for myself. I've never felt like I was on the same wavelength as someone else to get that far. 
2	i have a new boyfriend and i love him a lot but i can't fall asleep at his house cause i feel too anxious cause he's so cute, and i also get really gassy and i'm afraid i'll fart in my sleep :(
3	Check out my new (android) dating app for MBTI and Enneagram communities!	
4	What type is your Partners type?	What do you like and dislike about your relationship with them? 
3	My bf is an INFJ. I like that our relationship has been awesome and that he is sweet and understanding. We get along well and there's a lot of promise. We're both incredibly drawn towards each other. \n\nI dislike that sometimes we can have different communication styles and that there's 10 hours of difference between us, so we have a hard time finding a time to talk with each other (without either one having to compromise their schedule).
2	He’s an intj. ☺️
1	My partner is xNFP (thinking more I than E). I like that he talks to me a lot, we have the same sense of humor, he is down to go on adventures with me no matter how small and that we understand each other really well. \n\nI dislike that we can both be a little insecure about our relationship at times (thinking one person likes the other less, etc) but other than that I feel like we’re a good match
1	He’s an ENFP!
1	ENTJ\n\nLikes: Committed, sensual, reliable\n\n\n\nDislikes: TERRIBLE communicator lol 
8	hey isfp men! a question i have for you guyz.	do you act feminine sometimes, a lot of the time, all the time? if someone who didn't know me saw me hang around my friends, they would prob think i was a homosexual. i like to get super close to my guy friends. sometimes i will rest my head on their shoulder or hug them. i also like to send them cute messages and call them "bb", "babe". \n\ni'm not homosexual. i repeat, i am not a homosexual. and I don't have anything against homosexuals. can anyone else relate? is this normal behaviour for isfp men, or men in general? i see this type of behaviour in the sad chill community a lot. 
16	Can you repeat that one more time, maybe add a "no homo" in there too? Just to be safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes. I think it has to do with us being childish and ability to freely to express our emotions. It's a running joke between my good friends that I'm in the deep deep caves of the closet. Even my gay friend's mother jokingly once said I'm gayer than his son... But I'm not homosexual. I repeat, I am not homosexual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: No homo.
6	also, i would make an educated guess and guess that millennials and Gen Z are the most likely to show this type of behaviour, because the newer generations tend to be more accepting of people, are rebels and aren't very traditional. just mah two cents.
6	I'm bisexual. Most of the time I don't present myself as feminine. Sometimes I get in a mood to experiment with my appearance in a way that could be confusing to a lot of people with more traditional gender ideas. But that's like once a month maybe. 
6	I'm bisexual. I have a feeling a larger percentage of us are. \n\nThe fact that you had to declare that you have nothing against gay people AND stated "no homo" three times suggests to me that you might be bi too? Because you sound exactly like me before I accepted that I was bi, and people who are secure in their sexuality don't tend to speak that way.  It sounds like you're looking for reassurance that it's possible to be straight while presenting as a gay person. It's possible, but rare.  Although so is being 100% straight.\nJust something to think about. :)
4	lol I do it joking sometimes x) 
3	Yes, I'm totally straight, but do everything you described. Many people initially think I'm gay. I just get physical to show affection sometimes and act slightly feminine 
5	Maybe a little bit, I'm definitely very reserved but I think I give off a masculine vibe. I'm not super affectionate with my guy friends but sometimes I do joke around with them. I wouldn't say I'm completely straight, but I'm not attracted to guys enough to say I'm bi either\n\nI also like taking a submissive role with some women, so maybe that has something to do with it 
3	Yup. I've always been asked if I'm gay, and in relationships I generally prefer my gf to wear the pants. Once I really open up around people I have a lot of feminine interests and behaviors that I hide most of the time. 
2	Do you have a father figure? Or a close masculine influence in your life (brother other familty etc.)\n\nGet one if not and hit the gym, pretty much it. 
2	Well, I'm neither a dude nor an isfp, as it happens, but there are loooots of F dudes in the world and the younger ones in particular seem to have trouble expressing their love for each other, due to the ever limiting and inherently damaging societal norms.  If it's what I think it is, it comes out as a lot of over the top, surfacey pseudo-homosexual pretense.  \n\nWhat you're engaging in is not feminine.  It's healthy philia (Greek for friendship) love.
1	The exact opposite is true for me. I spent far too many years in the closet. Lets just say my parents were not supportive of such things. I adopted the straight persona so well that to this day gay men don't approach me. Unless you look like you need a hug all you're gonna get from me is a handshake or a pat on the back.
1	My friends normally guess that I am gay, I can be more feminine but I believe I’m a mix between that and masculine. I am very touchy with my guy friends and tend to have very feminine guy friends which are all straight funnily enough lol. But I choose who I am like this with as I’ve been hurt in the past, and only the guys I trust I will be like this with, 
1	Yes
5	What’s your relationship with your parents like?	And what types are they
6	My mom is an ESFJ. We definitely have our differences (she talks a LOT more than I do, and cares much more about social etiquette), but overall she is very sweet and probably the most selfless person I know. She *never* does anything for herself. She always lets us choose what we watch or what music we listen to or where we go for lunch. She constantly buys us small gifts, but feels guilty buying herself anything unless it’s on sale for really cheap (even though money isn’t much of an issue for us). \n\nMy dad is an ESTP. Our relationship is a little more complicated. I’m definitely more similar to him, especially when it comes to interests and sense of humor. But we’re opposites when it comes to morals/ beliefs, which can cause us to butt heads fairly often. He is also pretty self centered, and I’ve often gotten irked that he doesn’t try to help my mom with stuff around the house, even though they both work full time (I try to help her as much as I can because I don’t think it’s fair she should have to do everything). When I was younger, he would scream at me, swear at me, and insult me over small things if he had had a long day. About a year ago, he screamed at me that I didn’t “f——ing love” him because I apparently wasn’t excited enough when he had given me a necklace a few weeks prior. He also told me that I didn’t really love or care about anything other than myself, and that I’d probably never get married. I don’t think my dad is a bad guy, but he was raised in a very abusive household and really, *really* needs to feel liked by others, and gets his feelings hurt very easily, which usually results in him exploding. \n\nSo I’m definitely closer to my mom lol. My parents actually get along great though, because my mom likes feeling needed and like she has a purpose, and my dad doesn’t mind other people doing stuff for him lol. For the most part, though, I get along with my parents very well, and overall, we tend to have a lot less day-to-day drama than a lot of other families I’ve seen. 
3	Mom ( I N F J )  That's just a guess though\n\nHonestly don't talk to her much. Never really did. My relationship with her was much better before she had her stroke though. She really isn't the same woman she used to be. A lot less judgmental than she used to be though. I just sit quietly with her for a few hours each week. We know we love each other, but we hardly have a damn thing in common. Never did really. Neither of us are talkers either. I used to play Scrabble with her a lot, but her vision is so bad nowadays that she couldn't play if she wanted to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDad ( I S F P ) Like father like son\n\nIts been eleven months since he passed. I fucking miss him. We, likewise to my mother, shared no common interests, but had the best conversations. At some point I stopped trying to make him proud, and from then on its like I had a really old best friend. I used to visit home once a week and me and him would stay up until the sun came up talking about stuff. He was my best friend. Starting to cry so I'm gonna stop at that.
2	Mom - INFJ\nDad - ISTJ\n\nMy dad is quite controlling, my mom talks a lot. My pet peeve for both of them is telling me things, in great detail, that I already know despite my protests.\n\nOther than that, we seem to get along quite well—at least, much better than my sister (INFP?) and my parents.
2	Intp(for sure) and Enfp(I think).\n\nMy dad's pretty funny, and I have many good memories including him. I've always been a bit of a daddy's girl haha. However, I don't feel like I know him too well. He's not forthcoming about himself, and he never tried to teach me values or skills or anything like that, so I dont know what he believes in really, apart from a few things I've weasled out of him.\n\nMy mom has betrayed my trust hard in the past so I've kept an emotional distance from her. She's tried being affectionate and caring and I appreciate that, and feel bad, but I dont trust it. She's more forthcoming about her opinions, and she took me and my siblings to church (though those beliefs didnt stick). Like my dad she never really taught me many skills. Shes also a lot chattier than I am, and talks about topics that I dont find engaging.
2	My dad is ISFP thought, lol. I get along with him now but teenage years fucked everything for a while.\n\ndon't know the type of my mom completely sure, but she typed ENFJ in a test and I can see her like one. I don't get alone with her since she's extremely unhealthy with a lot of things. 
11	How do I stop giving a shit about other people's opinions?	I'm very easily triggered by trivial things like people saying they love something I hate or vice versa, I just can't help it. Nothing else pisses me off more, actually. I realize it's useless and pointless, and I don't even get why it pisses me off so much in the first place, but I've always been like that.\n\nHow do you do it?
3	I have the same problem. It helped me to realize that the person doing these things probably doesn't have the same reaction to "love" "hate" type phrases, and therefore would not find that kind of thing offensive. Therefore, they wouldn't expect you too either. Some people just say everything in a very intense way, and may not even feel as strongly as they're coming off. 
3	Let them have their opinion. Everyone is different, but we're all human. As long it doesn't physically affect you, who cares what other people think? Occasionally it's good to engage a bit with them and try to understand their perspective, but it's also important to just learn to accept that not everyone is the same as you.
2	i think... work toward understanding that both your opinion and another's are valid. not everyone has the same relationship with something as you do. and that's fine
2	Explore why you want others to have the same opinions/tastes as you. Does it make you feel accepted and validated when they are in agreement with you? Why is your value placed on others validating your own likes and dislikes?

1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
6	ISFP Creativity	Hey ISFPs,\n\nI’m INFP.  Which type is more creative?
29	Creativity is subjective 
18	Judging from your user name, I’m gonna go with INFP.
4	I don't know. I don't really fucking now. \^\_\_\^
2	INFP: Creative\n\nISFP: Artistic
3	how do you get rid of the biological desire for sex	
8	Just accept that it is apart of your Biology and countless centuries of evolution. \n\n  its a natural instinct especially for males to desire sex. Dudes have something like 3-5 times higher sex drive than their counterparts anyways. 
3	Why, though???
5	Do nofap long enough.
5	Leaving MGTOW won’t do that, but it will likely make you happier, which could reduce how much you care about this particular issue. c:
6	Get old
2	Why do you want to?
2	reducing internet related pics, and distracting yourself when you feel an urge. You will have to read or watch videos with tips about nofap, etc. once I did 101 days of nofap. that was my longest streak, now im on day 1
2	Have more sex or masturbate more
1	I don’t 
11	Mood cycles	Ok, so maybe this problem is not related to being an isfp at all, but my mood goes in dramatic cycles. \n\nAt my best, I am social, confident, productive, happy, and carefree. Inevitably, it seems, my mood will turn to the opposite. I become frustrated with everyone and snap at people, i want to be alone but feel extremely isolated, I can’t get anything done and I hate myself. \n\nI seem to flip between these two moods with absolutely no trigger. Sometimes, I go months in a good place before it flips, and sometimes it’s only a few days. Either way, it seems inescapable and I have grown tired of being thrown into this state every so often. \n\nDoes anyone else have the same issue, or know how to escape it? Like I said, I am sick of this and I’ll do anything to stop feeling this way
4	I feel the same, for the past 2 weeks I've been pissed off at everyone for some reason. Today I just said to myself life's not worse this sort of hassle so I just decided to just smile and think positive thoughts, this is what helped me. 
5	Same. And my cycles are unpredictable, so whenever I’m in a productive phase I get very focused and annoyed when I think someone or something is “getting in the way” of me achieving my goals. \n\nI can go from Eeyore-mode to “not now chief, I’m in the fuckin ZONE!” from one day to the next. My family is used to it but I imagine it could be frustrating for some people.
1	Mood Cycles are HORRIBLE. I have them too. It's exhausting. Some days I'll wake up and be extremely motivated, and you'll need to go out of your way to piss me off. On other days, someone's breathing will piss me off and ruin my whole day. I'm assuming that it is an ISFP (like myself) thing. Sadly haven't found any way to fix the issue. Sleeping helps sometimes.
15	Thoughts on Being an ISFP	Small preface: Primarily just a browser and I identify as ISFP but I really have to thank this sub- it's contents and users for giving me confidence/comfort in what I have/am experiencing and feeling - overall, being relatable. Anyway, here's some early morning thoughts I had on being an ISFP:  \n\n\nPerhaps the biggest physical flaw to an ISFP (or maybe this extends past us) is that we are only human. When we experience something that fulfills our senses, it is a but unfortunate that we are confined to the five human senses. As a human these senses have certain physical limits - such as only being able to see/perceive fragments of the color spectrum, or in the same light hear certain sounds, or metaphorically not actually being able to feel the rush of air flowing past and under your wings as you soar through the sky. Now in writing this, I also realize that this so to speak "flaw" is also what makes us so amazing and unique. Though we are bound by the human senses while we heavily embrace all the various experiences of our life (music, paintings, photos, food, etc.) that fulfill our senses and in turn "elevate" us and our sense of feelings - those limitations are what push us to elongate those experiences and prolong that sensual high. I guess a good analogy would be like searching for that next hit or next "high" of whichever drug. More specifically, that is when we take that moment and put it in a different perspective, maybe away from convention even - whether it be changing the perspective, framing, or angle of a photo, shading or coloring a work of art differently, or producing a musical (or non-musical) sound that no one has ever heard - creating that next "hit". Honestly this does not apply to just the traditional arts, but can be projected onto any profession, hobbies or interests that a person has as long as you can imagine it. 
7	This is lovely and true.  I think you're an N, though, not an S :)
3	I love it, I feel like I understand others very well. However I feel like I barely talk to people and its hard for me to open up, even to some friends I've known for a really long time. 
2	Overall pretty good, but I hate having inferior Te.
2	Its hard for me to have a detailed opinion on what its like being an ISFP. Mainly because I am far from educated on what the differences between each type are. All I know is what was written in my section, and how that relates to me. Which might be exactly what you are asking. I scored above the 85% on all of my letters and 96% on the A. A large portion of what was written there was pretty on the nose for me.\n\nWhile I find this well written and well expressed. I just couldn't care less. I am me. Its all I'm ever going to be. I don't sit and think about what it means to be an ISFP. I don't know why anyone would. Go ahead and stuff yourself into that box if it makes you happy. I just sit and think about who I am and who I want to be. I don't care what people think about me. I care about what I think about me. If I can love myself the rest will fall into place. I'm sure of it.\n\nPosting this before I try to revise it.
11	ISFPs and Honesty	So I've noticed that I tend to be straightforward and blunt about things than many of my xxTx friends. \n\nFor example, I was texting my INTJ friend and I told her she should come swimming with me. She told me how much she dislikes her body and she said "I just don't think anyone really wants to actually see me in skin tight clothes/ half naked, and honestly I'm fine with that 😂" \n\nShe kept using the 😂 emoji and became more and more passive aggressive. I tried to comfort her, and let her know that no one else cares about how she looks in a swimsuit besides herself. While I'm aware that she's very self conscious and insecure about her body, I would think an INTJ (who had previously mistyped as an INTP) would be more... straightforward? I wanted to reply in a "tough love" sort of way, like "listen, I know you dislike your body and I know that me saying this isn't going to suddenly make you change your mind, but it's really painful to watch you pass up good opportunities just because of your dislike of your body. Literally no one gives a fuck about how you look, and the sooner you can realize that, the sooner you can be happier with yourself and have a more fulfilling life!" But I knew if I sent that text, she would get butt hurt and start ignoring me.\n\n I know I didn't give the best example but I've noticed that so many people are just so passive aggressive and aren't ever fully honest or direct. Maybe it's just the influence of my childhood ENTJ best friend, but I'm always blunt about the truth. If they need to realize some truths, I want to be able to tell them without them getting all butthurt. After all, if they were to do the same to me (as my ENTJ friend has done to me before), I wouldn't get butthurt and would appreciate their sincere honesty. Maybe I would even realize a thing or two.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the relationship of ISFPs and other types with honesty? Do you think ISFPs have a better ability to both dish it and take it than some other types? Or am I just an asshole? I'm generally a pretty gentle nonconfrontational person, but if I feel strongly about something I'm not afraid to be more harsh and call things out.
8	Yessss, I relate to this. I actually doubted that I was an ISFP for a while because I kept reading about how *passive* we’re supposed to be, and while I can’t really be aggressive or mean easily, I’m actually very assertive. I see no point in lying or not being straight forward. I think it just adds unnecessary drama and can create problems. \n\n   My brother is an ISTJ and he is not straightforward with others *at all*. Whenever we got in arguments when we were younger, he would just pretend things didn’t happen, but I’d be the one to be like “hey, sorry I was being rude” or whatever, and once I would address a problem he would too. He is not assertive at all though.\n\n    I also relate to talking with friends. I kind of struggle because a lot of my friends also will do that whole “I’m so ugly!!” thing, and while I don’t mind it once in a while, sometimes it’s like a recurring *thing*. Once, my friend was complaining about how she always ‘looks like trash’ and I literally said “hey, I love you, but you’re gorgeous, stfu.” I don’t like when people hide from problems or lie to avoid consequences or fish for compliments or try to hide their feelings or anything like that. I’m very, *very* straightforward, and it’s completely unnatural for me to lie (unfortunately lol). 
4	Idk mate, this might be due to influences in upbringing etc. I’m terrible with communication and although I’m a pretty blunt person, when it comes to being honest with people at the expense of maybe hurting them or trying to get them to change their own mindset I will just avoid it at all costs. Lol 
5	I am also much more straight forward than all of my friends. Except my best friends that is. My best friend is an ENTJ, and we have done pretty much everything together since middle school. He has possibly rubbed off on me a little. I know he has gotten much more considerate of peoples feelings over the years too, so maybe he picked up some of my traits as well.\n\nI don't know what it is, but my other friends will never just give me a straight answer. It drives me bananas sometimes. If you don't want to do something. Just say no. I don't want an excuse. I want an answer. Please don't answer my questions with a story. I don't want an anecdote. I want an answer.\n\nDon't ask me if you look fat in a dress unless you really wanna know. I'm not gonna sugar coat my answer. I wish everyone would do the same. I am not being mean. I'm being honest. Lying to you would be doing you a disservice. Lying is a waste of everyone's time, and only adds pain to the world.\n\nIf you are someone I care about, and I see you doing something idiotic. I'm gonna call you an idiot. If you are doing something genius. I'm gonna call you a genius. If you smell bad. I'm gonna tell you that you stink. If you look good in that top. I'm gonna let you know you look fly.\n\nOn the flip side. If I am doing something stupid. Please please please. Tell me. I can handle the truth. I'm a big boy now. I would rather be told I'm being a fool than continue being a fool without knowing it. \n\nI don't care much for being able to dish it and serve it. I just want everyone to be honest with each other. Lying is such a fucking waste of time. All we have is time. Lying would just be robbing each other of the most important resource we have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not being harsh. You are being the friend they need you to be.
2	Eh, I don’t know. I’m like your friend, I don’t like making people feel bad, basically, or I don’t wanna appear “rude”, so I’m kind of passive aggressive-ish like this myself.  \n\n😅 (—> see?)\n\n(or maybe... I’m not an isfp???? Nah I’m def isfp. I just have ~social anxietyyyy~ and hate when people are upset with me.)
1	INFP here and I think from experience with Intuitive vs Sensing friendships I see how this went down for her- I avoid that behavior like fishing anyway and genuinely do favor bluntness but in a low enough mood it comes out. Personally I know I'd be less prone to that passive aggressiveness with people if they were generally more forthcoming with nice or attentive comments - particularly in recognizing the need to hear these things in that low mood.\n\nIt's when you start down that path, of saying something self deprecating and making yourself vulnerable for a moment, and the conversational partner doesn't just fail to indulge in the common social script ("of course you look fine in a bathing suit"), but tries to subvert it or pivot the conversation, perhaps thinking to teach.  This alerts me, as an iNtuitive, that they disapprove of my behavior (itself, a terrible feeling) - whether they're being mean or direct or not, it's that unwillingness to indulge my clear moment of weakness as a friend that makes me feel twice as embarrassed. It becomes a question of why doesn't this person just want to make me feel better. Why don't they realize what their words are doing to me right now. Why did I have to start this conversation in the first place. \n\nBut I can take the tough love if it's part of a compliment sandwich. I value honesty above everything. I just need something like a verbal hug sometimes, to see how much people care, and everything feels alright.\n\nA quick bit to add to your hypothetical tough love example that would work a little better (on me anyway) -"It's painful to see you pass up opportunities *because I really love seeing you happy and sharing it with you"*  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso - I know you said it's not a perfect example but cut your friend some slack. Body issues are complex and deeply ingrained for anyone. Being squirrely about certain extremely sensitive subjects doesn't mean someone doesn't value honesty and bluntness like you do for most other things. We all have a few things that break our typification.   \n\n\nAnyway, I don't know how you responded to her, maybe you answered in a way that I would have completely agreed with and responded well to. But you described a pattern I've seen in my friendships and I thought an iNtuitive take might help you understand where her behavior came from. 
11	How do You relate to music?	Not what your favorite songs are, your pattern of playing the songs you like, etc. fuck that, don’t care.\n\nWhen I hear a song I like, in a moment, I immediately associate it with all the beauty I see in that moment. Music is truly the thing that defines all the best moments of my life. I associate songs with visuals and activities.\n\nFor example: I’m a snowboarder... if a song is playing in an awesome Travis Rice video, if I hear that song a month later, I immediately think of snowboarding.\n\nThe song I heard when I first saw the Northern Lights in Iceland was Bon Iver “Holocene”. So when that song comes on... I could be in the gym, driving around a city, it doesn’t matter the surroundings... emotion comes over me and I’m immediately back in that place, and I can visually picture that moment.  \n\nI’ll be hiking through a forest in France, and when a certain song that played when I was in Korea 2 years ago on top of a mountain I immediately remember about that moment.\n\nBottom line, I’m wondering how music relates to your senses and the moments you hear it and how it associates with you. \n\n
5	Certain songs definitely take me back to major emotional events in my life. Whenever I’m deeply processing a feeling (typically love) I am hyper-aware of music I guess, and relate to it, often associating the current person or event in my life with a certain song and getting sentimental about that song forever after that. \n\nIf the feelings for that person ever change, so do my feelings for that song. I cringe and turn the station when I hear a couple of songs that come on the local radio station and it’s one hundred percent because they dredge up uncomfortable memories.\n\nOn the other hand, I can get into a fight with my husband and then hear a Lumineers song on my playlist that reminds me of him boosting me up on his shoulders and running across a parking lot so I didn’t step in mud puddles while wearing sandals. And suddenly everything is wonderful and back in that moment.\n\nThat’s Se.
3	Pretty much the same way you do, but sometimes I immediately think of how the song made me feel or what the content of the song is supposed to evoke instead
3	Yup, I feel the same way about music as you do. I associate different songs with different times  and the different places that I’ve been. When I hear certain songs, all the memories and emotions just overwhelm me in that moment. I love it 
3	This is gonna be weird, guys, but ok.\n\nI grew up watching AMVs (anime music videos) and MVs (music vids) of tv shows and anime I liked.\n\nSince I have no talent, I never actually created many myself (there’s a few lurking on youtube somewhere from like 2008 lmao), but whenever I listen to songs I love I imagine what certain scenes and clips would fit with the beat/lyrics.\nI basically create MVs of movies/shows/etc. in my head. \n\nSo... I’m a loser, moving on.
3	Music for me is comforting. It doesn't try to control us, but is their freely for people to enjoy and connect with and that's what I like.\n\nI like the way music makes me feel and how it triggers my emotions and memories within. It's like it's speaking to me and understands where I'm coming from without having to say anything and that's how I recognize what taste I have or prefer in music. It's also like an extension of my personality or behavior. That's probably why when others don't agree or have the same taste in music that I do, I understand that there's a side to them that I've never discovered or felt to know.\n\nI really enjoy music and the infinite amounts that I've yet to possibly experience. =)
2	The heading for this should really be “How do your ISFP senses relate to music?”
2	Not really at all, tbh. I just enjoy something or I don't.
2	I know EXACTLY what you're talking about.\n\nAnytime I hear the song "Animal I Have Become" I remember every detail of a moment when I was younger playing a video game at a friends house. I can remember clearly the custom made wrestler I made on his WWE game and that was the theme song I chose.\n\nAnytime I hear the song "Popcorn Funk" I can remember clearly the first time I ever got high. Despite the fuzziness of most other memories on the subject.\n\nEvery time I hear the song "The Warriors Song" I remember clearly the desensitivity training I went through when I joined the infantry. Same goes for "Indestructible" Those videos were fucking horrifying. I hate both of those songs.\n\nFor some reason when I hear "Let It Go" I always imagine being on an American Idol stage in front of Simon Cowell just belting that song knowing damn well he's gonna tell me I'm terrible. No right no wrong no rules for me. Im free.
1	I feel music throughout my body. I went to see Ron Gallo in Kansas City a couple weeks ago and drank a bit. If I wasn't headbanging and swaying I had my hands up to the sky with my head down like Christians at mega churches. 
1	That sounds very Si to me. I love music and I search for music that fits my mood. I like upbeat music during the day and sad slow music at night. When I'm going through a tough period I look for lyrics that match my situation. But it is about my mood not my surroundings as you describe.
20	Ultimate ISFP Playlist	I put a post on here a little over a week ago for people to drop their favorite songs. I knew going in that the playlist was going to be an absolute monster. Dozens of peoples musical tastes colliding together to create a beautiful mess. I left off a few songs because I tried to keep it to one song per person. Well here is it. This is what we made.\n\n[Ultimate ISFP Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMypkp0qQOkTVjX2KHinLaAHOVvy7FF20)\n\nAlso feel free to collaborate. I made the thing public. I encourage you to add your own music. Just one or two songs though. I selfishly added a second song to it myself. You can use this link to collaborate on it.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMypkp0qQOkTVjX2KHinLaAHOVvy7FF20&jct=t9s5pAiPiyPn62BOwvhMoMaWw5ZN4A&disable\_polymer=1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMypkp0qQOkTVjX2KHinLaAHOVvy7FF20&jct=t9s5pAiPiyPn62BOwvhMoMaWw5ZN4A&disable_polymer=1)

1	Well done.
2	how long does it take you to dry yourself off after a shower?	Takes me 5 minutes. 
8	Sweet. \n\nI typically wanna dry myself off after a shower, but then I remember I’m an ISFP, so I cry for ten minutes about all the injustices in the world, decide to go backpacking through Europe for the next 6 months, spend a lot of alone time watching sunsets over Southern Spain by myself. Decide I miss my family, come home, spend time with them, then work a mundane boring job for the next few years, then get on Reddit and decide I need to go back out an explore again.\n\nBut that’s just me.\n\nThen I dry myself off.
4	One of two answers.\n\n1: If I have a towel. Like thirty seconds.\n\n2: For the 80% of the time I forget to bring a towel with me. Like fifteen minutes.
2	Like an hour. I have very long hair.
11	Figure it out.	This is my motto. I have been living by this statement for just over ten years now. It means a lot to me. People ask me often what it means. This is my first time writing about it, so bear with me while I try to order my thoughts in a way that makes sense.\n\nIt means exactly what it says. Figure it out. Doing so, however, isn't always easy. Going through a rough time and crying on someones shoulder can be figuring it out. Buckling down and suffering to get it done can be figuring it out. Moving on can be figuring it out. Whatever it takes to get from your point (Point A) to the desired location (Lets say Point B) is figuring it out. Figuring it out also doesn't have anything to do with succeeding. Its all about not giving up. The it in figure IT out isn't the thing. It is you.\n\nNo one else is going to figure it out for you. You can have help, but ultimately you have to figure it out. Whatever it takes to keep you moving is figuring it out. No matter the situation, and no matter the outcome. You have to do whatever it takes to keep moving. If you can't accept it. Change it. If you can't change it. Find a way to live without it. If you can't live without it. Find a way to live with it. Figure it out.\n\nStop moving for a while and think. If thats what you need to do. Then do it. You don't have to exist on a graph where your movement on said graph is constant. Your movement doesn't have to follow a pattern. You can move faster some years and slower some years. You can regress too. That is totally fine. As long as you don't give up. The moment you give up. I feel sorry for you. Giving up on yourself is the worst thing you can do. You matter. Don't you fucking dare let yourself believe you don't. Figure it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few quotes that I really like on the subject.\n\n"Everyone has a plan. Until they get punched in the mouth." Mike Tyson\n\n"When life knocks you down try to land on your back. If you can look up you can get up." Les Brown\n\n"Be safe friend. Don't you dare go hollow." Laurentius of the Great Swamp\n\n"If you're going through Hell. Keep going." Winston Churchill\n\nThoughts?
6	I like your motto. It’s similar to mine which is “you’ll be fine”. In a way it’s like telling myself that I’ll figure it out and pull on through. I haven’t had a situation where I didn’t end up fine. I’ve had many situations where I was not fine for a while but eventually I was fine. \n\nMy other mottos include:\nFun is what you bring with you \nTrust no ho \nThere are things to be learned from this. 
2	I had a similar motto younger that I liked to follow, it was "think what you do" or something
9	I was very depressed. What happened and what I'm going to do now + hints to reduce depression + TL;DR:	&#x200B;\n\n# There is a "TL;DR:" below. Don't worry guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn October I decided to leave my career during my third year. I felt very tired, not wanting to do more homework. In classes no one thought like me and I didn't see a future as an art teacher either. I also lost the habit of lifting weights. In December I felt like I had more free time, but I had 2 part-time jobs and I decided to leave my job as a waiter to be calmer with my job at the pizzeria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn January I began to notice how alone I was. My best friend, M, only texted to me if I texted to him before. It seemed he wasn't interested in me. So I stopped talking to him. Each time I went down a little more. It was getting worse every time. Until this month that I was fired from my job, without explanation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI lost everything because of my decisions. Now I'm besieged by my regrets and worries. I feel terrible because I'm 24 and still don't know what to do with my life because I always end up doing stupid shit like that. I feel old. Nothing in my hands. There was also the pressure to run out of food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What I'm going to do now.**\n\nUnfuck myself. I recently sent a message to my old job as a waiter. The boss loved me very much that she told me to go to work today. Also, I think I'm going back to university or get a full time job for this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that help me when I'm depressed.**\n\nthis could have an effect on you or not, but at least, if you propose small things and you do them, somehow your brain is taking off the depression because **you're doing something.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**• Order your space. Room or home.**\n\nI noticed that when my room is tidy, my mind too. "*Your body is your mind*".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**• Do it.**\n\nthis is my favorite because is the only thing I can memorize: "The habit of getting shit done". Just set an appointment and make it. **Choose something possible to do, and do it**. It doesn't matter how you feel about it. It doesn't matter if you're too fucking depressed to do anything. Just do the thing, every single day whether you feel like it or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe success doesn't depend on your big idea, or planification, or how much did you think in something. **Is what you fucking do what matters.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**• Take a shower everyday.**\n\nI didn't do it. But the feeling of post-shower and that freshness is really helpful to make you think better and to mantain a **minimal routine** that makes each day to be separated from the other. I also will take more care of my little beard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**• If you can, wake up at the same time everyday.**\n\nI broke my circadian rhythm 2 months ago. There is nothing more depressing than waking up and watch the sunset. Also, morning is motivating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**• Propose to yourself, only 2 or 3 things, no more.**\n\nIt depends on you, but I can't handle so many things in my mind, which is a bad thing because I find many many things interesting. But now I'm playing with just 3 available slots: **1) A job:** This is obligatory for me. **2) A career:** maybe I will come back to university or use this space of time to another skill **3) A skill that you like to learn**: I'm learning a new language. **4) drawing:** A little one is to improve my drawing skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**• Before taking a decision, talk to your friends.**\n\nI took a lot of stupid decisions. You need other points of view.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**• DON'T OVERLOAD YOURSELF.**\n\nI did it and I got fucked up. Don't choose so many activities because you will not be abble to respond well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nPoor aux Se, silly Ni and absent Te made me commit a lot of mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Poor Se**: take care of your environment. order your room. Don't overload yourself. Be direct and simple. don't complicate yourself.\n\n**Silly Ni:** I took a lot of bad decisions from incongruous presumptions of the future. Don't assume things that you do not know if they are real. Talk to your friends before making a decision. Ask your friends to help you see the future that you want to have.\n\n**Special mention, Fi:** just don't let your emotions fuck everything and dominate your life. Think what your true feelings are, and put them above your feelings of the moment.\n\n**Te:** Learn the habit of getting shit done. See above in "***• Do it".*** Choose something and do it. No matter how you feel. Be direct and simple.
3	I just read the TL:DR(I might go back and read full post later), but you seem like you have the right idea. good luck with getting stuff done! I have found that it sort of leads to a snowball effect, and usually starts with just one small step
2	This sounds like you've been doing a lot of positive thinking, good on you. You're right about not overloading yourself. Just start off relatively small and you can get the ball rolling and build some momentum.\n\nI personally find exercise with a goal in mind to be really important for me. I was at my most efficient and proactive when I was training for a marathon. The knock-on effect that something like that brings to the rest of your life just can't be overstated.\n\nI'm currently in a bit of a downturn myself, a depressive episode I'll call it. I'm going to give myself a kick up the backside today and go and make things work again. Thanks for sharing.
3	when I feel shitty I like to "read" an audio book	as I am/was depressed but I don't want to read deceptive self-help books, I'm listening this one\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF65lvwQPbw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF65lvwQPbw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nit's about a jewish that lived in a  concentration camp and learned something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	that's a good one. however, i don't see myself building a relationship like VF was able to draw to mind to help him persevere/endure.  \n  \nI know i'd be one of the ones who wouldn't last.  \n  \n(i just hope i'd go out fighting)
3	How do I open up to people?	How do I initiate in conversion, or what should I do when meeting new people. 
3	Honestly, introspect a little and think about what would make the situation better. Think about past experiences and how you can make them better. When it comes to being more talkative and more open, it really varies from person to person. But, I can tell you what’s been working for me.\n\nI used to always beat myself up for not being social. I would go to groups and force myself to go to social gatherings I didn’t want to go to. And honestly... it was awful. I didn’t make new friends. I just became more reserved and miserable.\n\nThen, after one very bad interaction, I was like “screw it—I’m not gonna socialize anymore.” That was also pretty bad, because no matter how introverted you are, you still need people to some extent.\n\nSo, I came to this middle ground: when I go out and do social things, I’m going to have them be things I enjoy. That way, if I don’t make friends or open up to anyone, I’ll still have a good time. And if I do, it’ll be easier to meet then, because of shared interest.\n\nThat’s what worked for me, but something else could work for you. Good luck!
2	Its fucking impossible for me to meet new people unless its forced upon me. Its not that I can't. I just won't. Though when I go to my local gaming store I have a steel pair of balls and will challenge any one to a game of Magic the Gathering and talk about the game relentlessly. Its like when I walk through those doors my I turns to an E. Magic has helped me make tremendous strides in my inability to talk to strangers. Dare I say I'm popular there. Find something you like doing. The conversation with strangers should come naturally. Hopefully they will do you the service of initiating contact first too.
3	the final playlist...for awhile	https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkzoUhhf5AR5ihjdKcX6ured
3	Everyone’s favorite genre of music?	I see a lot of you guys posting about alternative and indie music but i’m really into like rap but not like the generic rap, more like uhh good rap lol 
3	I listen to most chill electronic music, chill trap future bass. Pretty much anything melodic and slow. \n\nOn the other hand I love dubstep which I can get pretty heavy and crazy. I don’t listen to “regular” music for lack of better term 
2	Anime Openings. Is that a genre? If so. That.\n\nOtherwise. Punk Rock/Alternative Rock\n\nEdit: Literally anything with a banjo as well
2	thrash metal, stuff like Toxic Holocaust, Sodom, Metallica, Desaster, Vektor
2	Rap, throwback pop music, emotional songs, depressing songs
1	[Fucking love this rap remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbAj3EDJM8)
1	I love pop music... like, the lighter and happier, the better. I also love rap and R&B.\n\nI used to listen to a LOT of progressive metal and post-grunge, and I still do once in a while, but I don’t fw it like I used to. I like music that makes me feel energized.
1	Prog metal and prog rock, other metal, some electronic stuff, indie guitarish stuff, singer/songwriter, and psychadelic rock are probably my big ones.
1	Classic rock and indie.
1	Fellow isfp hiphop head here. I like all genres though, rap has been my favorite since I was like 8 years old (33 now) 
1	Progressive trance. Pure, honest, well intentioned, and not too wordy. \n\nAlthough I hate it has the word progressive in it.
8	So I'm an infp who is very interested in Isfp personality traits and would love to learn about you guys. Can you give me insights to what you guys look for in a person that make you want to be around him/her? Like what kind of people are you interested in, and how do you approach them?	
15	First off ISFP probably won’t approach you. No matter how intriguing/beautiful/sexy you are. You will likely have to make the first move.\n\nTo answer your question about what types the ISFP is attracted to, it varies (like I see more variation with ISFPs choosing romantic partners than any other type) and I think mostly because ISFPs are content with solitude and only open up to someone who really offers something we’re needing at the time.\n\nFor that reason I tend to be attracted to people who are strong in the areas where I am very weak (so xNTJs, ISTJs, etc.) although many ISFPs I see on here (esp males) tend to migrate toward people who allow them to feel “safe” expressing themselves and their feelings authentically (ExFJs, INFJs, etc.)\n\nThe best thing you have going for you is that INFP is probably the type we resemble most so you are already entering the situation with a deep understanding and empathy for ISFP weaknesses and feelings, which gets you past like three stages of the “getting to know ISFP” process that would normally be potential for a door slam.\n\nBe yourself. That’s ultimately what I find the most attractive in a person, period. If I get even the slightest whiff of fakeness, superficiality, or an attempt to manipulate me I get unreasonably annoyed.\n\nAlso do not insult or ignore, but I don’t really see INFP doing that anyway. If you reciprocate the ISFP affection equally or slightly greater than that they’ve shown you (not too much though, don’t want to seem needy) and they are even remotely interested, you should be on your way to a beautiful thing.
12	We just want someone who's genuine, we have the uncanny ability to tell if people aren't. So be yourself, no sense in pretending to be different just to get someone interested in you. 
4	I have listed and described some things in detail before. Feel free to look at it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/ap8na3/how\_do\_you\_become\_friends\_with\_an\_isfp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/ap8na3/how_do_you_become_friends_with_an_isfp/)\n\nPersonally for me, I find that I like to surround myself with mindful people who are genuine, seem friendly, positive and nice. Someone who is very easy to talk to and get along with, who treats everyone with the same respect and sentiment. Mainly people who have or may share similar qualities or emotions to my own. They are the kinds of people who I feel I can trust not to feel harmful or toxic of being around and are more comfortable being with. On the other hand, people that I tend to stay away from are the ones who would seem to take advantage of me, are negative and controlling, self entitled or bossy, openly judgmental and not aware of others feelings or their actions, are fake and insensitively gossip a lot of false nonsense towards things or others. Being around those types of people makes me very uncomfortable and sensitive. For those reasons, I tend not to associate myself with those kinds of people. (will immediately close the door to anyone who is like this relationships wise)\n\nThough I find that it's much easier to connect with others if we both have similar interests and views. These are just some helpful insights that I can help fill you in on. Some ISFPs may find themselves not worthy enough to be with others, but if you are already showing keen interests in them, that's a good thing. They want people who like them and notice them for who they are individually. Also, they may in turn will do the same if they find that you are a good person or influence to be around. =)  It usually takes a long time to get close to us, but when you do, you will  see just how strong of a bond we can form with another person. Also, we'll freely let you in on our secret world where all our passion, commitment, creativity,  loyalty, compassion, empathy and depth of love that people normally don't openly get to see or know about will be shown. Everything about our life of wonder, peace, fun, and purpose will be shared too. Basically we will reveal to you our real selves.  And if you ever get to that place, you will be considered a very special person in their eyes.\n\n&#x200B;
2	We don’t look for anything in a person. As soon as someone comes up to us, we decide if we like them or not.\n\nIf you want to be amenable to us, just live life. I’m drawn to Europeans. They don’t give a shit about anything but the finer things in life. Sitting on a patio, smoking a cigarette, enjoying the soft breeze... soft music playing in the background in a beautiful narrow artistic alleyway. Café life. The baguette is around the corner.\n\nBottom line... you can’t fake it with true ISFPs. We know what we want. But we can’t describe it. \n\nKinda like Amélie.
1	Someone understanding, genuine, kind, and funny - I have a bit of a strange sense of humor, so if they can appreciate it I always like spending time with them. Acting fake or trying to be too nice can seem weird though, like there needs to be a little bit of playful teasing for me, even in a platonic relationship. \n\nI'm talking to a girl right now and it seems like we get along pretty well. She's really kind, but still playful and teases me without going overboard. We also understand each other when we're messing around, and a lot of what she says just makes me laugh. She also seems very empathetic towards me which is kind of rare in my experience. It may be that I'm a tall, muscular guy, people don't assume I have many feelings, but it feels good to be able to talk to someone about them. She also contacted me first - I'm not really the type of guy to contact people unsolicited, unfortunately for my dating life :P
1	Oh yeah, and French women are sexy. They exude art, and a carefree lifestyle full of carelessness, but still have the confidence that we lack. If you are a woman who is trying to get an ISFP, study women like Marion Cotillard and Melanie Laurent:
16	Best Investment Ever	My robot vacuum is my new bff, just thought y’all should know in case you ever thought about getting one 😂
5	This is SO isfp
3	Good for ya! 
3	I didn’t know this was a personality thing, but I also love my robot vacuum. It’s a generic brand, bought on amazon, my husband named him Humberto, and he is vital to my sanity. 
2	Lmao! I’m totally taking that as a compliment 😛
2	Same! I’ve wanted one for years and told myself I need to be frugal and maintain my own floors. But I found one with great reviews and a good price on amazon so it was my housewarming gift to myself. I only wish I had bought one sooner! I haven’t decided on a name yet, I need a streak of inspiration 
2	starting to get bored of Anime	I remember when I was in love with Anime. Now I can barely watch a single episode without getting bored. I started to track the episodes I watch 5 years ago and add them onto my Anime list.\n\nI don't know if tracking my Anime has caused me to love Anime less or if I am just genuinely bored of it. I have been watching it ever since middle school...\n\nMy goal is to have watched 10,000 episodes. Why this is my goal? I don't know. But I want to complete this goal. \n\nMaybe I should try not to rush this, and enjoy every episode to the fullest. And I should also probably take a little break from Anime and hopefully my interest in it will be renewed.\n\nWhat do you think I should do? How should I go about this?\n\n
3	I never found that I got bored of anime. I found that I cant concentrate on the reading when im tired so it became more work than enjoyment. So what I do is I wait for 100-200 episodes to rack up and then I binge watch. Your goal is very weird. Anime is entertainment. To watch for the sake of getting to a goal of x amount of episodes is going to feel like work. Yes goals are good but I dont feel that entertainment should have goals.  
2	you know what’s great about watching new anime in 2019? the episode discussions on reddit. \n\ni’d say the best part of watching Game of Thrones was the online discussions.\n\ni think all the fan theories and speculation really fucked with George RR Martin.\n\ni swear 50% of the reason i keep up with JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is so that i can understand the memes. so many jojo memes.
2	Personally I only get bored by SoL/RomCom type stuff, just not my cup of tea. \n\nI recommend a few things:\n\n* If nothing excites you, just take a break and do something else. I'm currently completely done with music, absolutely hate everything, so I just don't listen to music. Games and anime are in full swing for me right now.\n\n* Drop things that are a slog to get through.\n\n* Do a mix of airing and finished shows. I usually only watched finished anime, but now I do both airing and finished. It's pretty fun to watch the finished things whenever you want, and have the airing shows as an extra treat. Also fun to comment on in episode discussion threads and just to keep up in general.\n\n* Try a different genre (I shouldn't be the one talking here since I'm pretty conservative, but whatever).\n\n* Don't make a chore out of it, don't make goals like "watch 10,000 eps". I made a chore out of music and it definitely crushes your enjoyment. Some light goals like "I want to watch 5 sports anime this year" are okay, though. Just don't force it.
2	Wow. You set such a high goal of watching so much anime lol. I mean I use to think like that too. I wanted to watch every anime out there so I could relate to other people who have watched them and because their interesting for my tastes, but not so much anymore. When I start to feel bored of them, I usually just take some time off it to do other things until I really feel like watching something new or it catches my eye right away. If I don't have time, a movie is always good too. I can see why it starts to get boring if you keep watching anime after anime like it's some kind of routine and no freedom. There's probably not really any fun in doing that... You sound like you need a break from it too. It's always fine to adjust your goal too if it tends to get too much. There is nothing wrong with that. =) I usually just watch anime whenever I want to for fulfillment and or self discovering what the world or characters are about. But it's entirely up to you how you want to go about it. I don't want to pressure you into anything you don't want to do. I trust that you'll find a few good alternatives for this. =)
4	made a Pokémon playlist	https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkxp5D47WVBXRD4jUaA-_FBQ\n\n
4	How to type an ISFP?	Hello, \n I’m relatively new to the Myer-Briggs types and I’m trying to type one of my friends. From some of my own observations, I have a hunch that he might be an ISFP, but I don’t have much confidence in my typing lol. \n\nSo I thought I would go straight to the source and ask what some of you guys think are distinct ISFP characteristics. \n\n(also, let me know if you agree that he might be an ISFP, or feel free to throw out any other types you think he could be)\n\nMy friend is quiet, but I wouldn’t say he’s shy or that he dislikes the company of others. He’s often talking or socialising with people, but he doesn’t attempt to make himself the center of attention. He’s not artistic in the typical sense, but he does enjoy music and he plays guitar. He definitely focuses on what’s happening now in the present, rather than worrying or dreaming about the future. He’s always the first to lend help and he’s really loyal to the people he cares about. He’s not the kind of person to jump into a debate and when deep subjects come up he tends to avoid them; that being said he does randomly spring some intense/serious comments.
5	Yup. Im an isfp male and it sounds a lot like me
1	yes but maybe isfj. who knows? maybe istp. hobbies? ideal jobs for him?
4	Telling vs Talking	Hi ISFPs of reddit. I (mid 30’s/F/INTJ) have been dating an (early 30’s/M)  ISFP for the last 8 months and as you can imagine, we don’t often see things in the same light. Most of the time it’s fine and provides some balance and insight (for me more than him I think) but when something comes up that we see differently, it turns into me “telling him what to do” if my opinion on the topic differs from his. \n\nI try to frame things from experience/intuition and try to use I and we statements vs you statements. In pure INTJ fashion I will also try and make suggestions or suggest alternative options when he isn’t happy about something in his life or we’re trying to find a balance. That usually gets interpreted as me telling him what to do even though he may agree that what I’m saying holds merit. \n\nAny suggestions on this? I’m open to working on my communication style, but when I try to flex it still seems like it doesn’t translate. I’m trying to figure out how much is me and how much is his stubbornness. 
4	Sounds like you’re doing too much.   Maybe this ISFP doesn’t want advice on how to improve their life. Remember ISFPs don’t like to lead or be lead.   I mean as a general rule people want to be heard and not told.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is sometimes ISFPs take the path of least resistance. IE “Fine you just tell me what you want to do then.” ... and say it while being slightly annoyed because they feel like they are being controlled.\n\nLet things happen a little more organically and don’t try so hard.
2	Maybe the way that you're communicating or going about it is the reason why he gets so emotionally stubborn to what you have to say to him? Remember, ISFPs are gentle and emotionally sensitive to others and want only to seek harmony in their relationships. They don't really like it when someone confronts them about something or seems controlling or is not easy to understand what exactly it is you are trying to convey. That's because they can sense it in the persons tone of behavior or actions towards them which they will feel, but not say it out loud to avoid conflict and in turn will cause them to want to become stubborn. \n\nI suggest trying to approach it like how he would approach you about the matter through his own words, feelings and actions. Talk to him in the ways that he knows how to handle and how it can be good for you or others involved. That way he can be more open about his feelings to you. Maybe he will come to understand it better too. If you can, be more encouraging and reassuring to let him know that you are not trying to hurt or judge him in any way. Though if you pressure him, he will most likely withhold from talking about things. I also suggest being more specific when you communicate to him and refrain from adding self-importance. Like don't say generic or broad things (like he is said person type or why he is like that) because he might take it too personally or might not get the chance to give you a fair answer. You don't want to make him feel accused of something instead just give him details about the little specific things you see from your eyes. If he sees what you are trying to describe to him, he will come to understand what it is you are feeling. \n\nAlso, if he's still conflicted afterwards, give him some space and time to think about it to reflect. Just try to be more patient. He probably doesn't want the problem to stick around for too long and will eventually find his own resolution on the topic. Hope this helps!

2	what do you think 2030 will be like?	
6	we still won't have flying cars
3	Like today but with weird ass music
2	Like today except I'll actually be old enough to call myself old without people cringing.
3	What do you DayDream about, and how focused are they?	I’ve recently gotten into MBTI Theory, and most of the online tests had me pegged as an INFP or INFJ.  But after being typed by others online as an ISFP, and understanding more about the Sensory/Intuition dichotomy, I’m fairly certain I am indeed an ISFP.\n\nMy question is, what are the nature of your daydreams, and how focused are they?  \n\nI daydream all the time when I am in boring mundane environments, but they are always focused on things rooted in reality (not abstract ideas).\n\nFor Example:  \n\nI love to travel overseas... it is what motivates me more than anything.  At any given time I will be mentally (and literally) planning my next 3 trips. When I am in the office at work, I will spend hours on end, mentally away from my current surroundings, thinking about what hikes I want to do in Iceland, or what Lisbon neighborhood I want to stay in.  Between sets at the gym, I’m mentally cataloging things I want to do on my next adventure, or while driving at a stop light I’m picking up my phone to look up the best baguette in Paris because it’s all I’ve been thinking about for the last 5 minutes.  I go days/weeks entirely focused on a small set of ideas/themes... and it completely consumes me.\n\nOn the flip side, put me in an environment that I’m passionate about, and my mind goes blank except for that which is around me, and I’m locked into every detail of my surroundings... taking it all in.\n\nFor Example:  \n\nI’ve played competitive soccer my whole life. Once I step on the field, everything is instinctual... my mind and senses are locked into every key detail of my surroundings, and my entire focus is on everything going on in my environment.  I also snowboard... when I’m on the mountain, everything is the feeling of floating through the snow, the beauty of nature, the peaceful quiet of the mountains... all my senses are focused on my environment.  Same thing when I hike in nature, or am walking around a foreign city taking in every detail of the art & architecture, the conversation of the locals, smells of the food.\n\nI live in the present when it interests me, and when I’m somewhere boring, all I’m thinking about is transporting myself to a better present.  I have very little long term goals other than living life to the fullest... my work (which bores me, but I am good at), is merely a necessary paycheck to fund my passions, and my mind transports me from those mundane environments on a daily basis.\n\nAlso, I should note that most of this mental planning I do constantly goes out the window once I get to the moment I’ve been thinking about for hours on end.  Once I am there, in the here and now, I do what feels right and any itinerary I put together goes out the window.  I become overcome with the beauty of the moment and my surroundings, and it takes over all else.\n\nI’m curious... is this a common theme among ISFPs, or might I be mistyping myself?\n\nThanks!
3	I daydream about traveling and love. Specifically, growing old in a happy and loving relationship and traveling with that person (like my folks do together.) \n\nI daydream about what my kids are going to be like when they’re older. What kind of teenagers and adults and parents they will be.\n\nIt’s all very unimaginative, basic stuff. 🤷🏼‍♀️
2	Infj here. My daydreams aren’t focused at all. I think focusing might actually limit my daydreams. I hop from one topic to another. Like I would daydream about how my new home will look like, but within seconds I dream about a secret portal or how my furniture is actually representative of a political system. The craziest daydreams are the best. Please no reality. 😊
2	I day dream about travel. I wanna move to a country like Thailand. I also play and love football(soccer)! Which position do you play and what team do you support? 
11	Am i the only one who’s not creative?	i see all these posts about being creative and “that’s how we are” but creativity is like my least strong attribute about me lol 
8	Are you sure you aren't? Creativity isn't necessarily the ability to paint or write a song. There are lots of different ways to be creative, you might just have not recognized or found an outlet to express your creativity. 
7	I’m not creative, I am however very into creating or being in aesthetically pleasing environments. I think that’s my version of creativity 
4	Same. I’m not imaginative so creative things like drawing, music, etc don’t come to me naturally
2	It's an old stereotype.  Don't sweat it.  That said, go get some cheap art supplies if you want and mess around.  100% of creatives were discouraged from something at some point in their lives (even if only by themselves) 🖤
2	Most ISFP's aren't, I wouldn't worry about it
1	I'm very creative. I just don't use that energy for anything meaningful. I funnel most of my creative impulses into Magic the Gathering. Its a competitive card game. I like to build to a theme as opposed to just building a tier one strategy. Everyone I play with just copy pastes something they found online (which is totally fine). Meanwhile you can find me in the corner trying to reinvent the wheel.
1	Nope. This is the reason it took me years to accept I'm isfp.
3	just wondering, why do you visit this sub?	I visit this sub because I relate to a lot of the users that post here, and it makes me feel less lonely in a way. 
8	Same reason here. Its just really nice to lurk the subreddit and be like "I feel at home". Before I found out that I was an ISFP I would be trying hard to identifiy with other types but being on here I know its just right
6	To sanity check myself and see how people with similar minds as mine think lol 
2	I like to see what my fellow isfps are about :)
2	I like being able to relate to others, and the sub is very welcoming:). Also, I know this is silly since it is technically an MBTI sub, but I appreciate that a lot of the posts have nothing to do with Myers Briggs, and its just ISFPs sharing little parts of their lives! Its just like-minded people talking about whatever, and I think that's pretty cool:).
1	I want to discover myself through the others that know themselves. I've been really reading into my type and doubting it because I don't relate to many of the attributes of an isfp. That being said, I've been trying to push myself into these stereotypes and hoping something I haven't tried yet just clicks. 
1	Mainly because I have a tremendous amount of nothing to do at work. Reddit helps fill the gap of time where I would otherwise be doing said nothing. The shit on here is pretty random. I like random.
20	Does anyone else here ever get the need to be creative, Yet get frustrated from the lack of any creative outlets?	Every once in a while I get the desire to go out and make something. Though I never know what to do. Does anyone else ever feel like this? And/or does anyone know of anything to attempt?
7	Yes! I would love to start doing woodworking but lack the tools, space and money. I also write very short stories, but if I don't finish it it that same sitting I don't ever finish it. I cant edit them, I just don't feel the story anymore. So they are what they are... Extremely random. 
6	Yes.  It's called lack of inspiration and every creative person experiences it :)  If I'm really feeling the urge to create but am lacking inspiration, I'll just start messing around with colors and textures and sometimes something emerges, sometimes it doesn't.  I have several paintings whose canvases held different lives and were gessoed over until something made sense.  The painting on top, then, is rich with both the texture and emotion of previous lives, and may or may not evolve from there.  Nothing is permanent until death (or a sale) :)
4	This used to happen to me pretty often. I would resort to drawing when I felt this way. I stopped drawing though because I got tired of having to have a picture in front of my face, otherwise my drawing would look like crap, because I can't draw from my imagination. And I simply don't have the patience to draw anymore. \n\nNowadays, I watch Anime and play my 2 favorite games, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Clash of Clans. These hobbies fulfill my creative needs. Watching Anime, not so much. But the games, definitely. 
3	I fuel all of my creative energy into creating new Magic the Gathering decks. There are still dozens of themes I have never built before, so I can always find something new and exciting to do with the game. Plus our local gaming store has a huge following for the game, and I have made a lot of friends through the game. It isn't Magic without the Gathering.
3	Yes, I went thru this whole phase of making furnitures with wood, concrete,   \nthen building custom cafe racer bike.... cooking \n\nremodeling house \n\nstarting youtube channel and selling photos online and ....repeat :)   \n\n\nI guess isfp really like to work with their hands. 
1	When I feel this way, I listen to some new music or some of my favorite older music and see what aspect of it inspires me. I go rent an instrument from the music store and try to learn to play it.\n\nOr I visit the art store and buy some paints. I browse Instagram for inspiring art content and see if I can create my own versions of things I like. That gets my creativity flowing. \n\nThe Internet is a gold mine for cool ideas. Start out trying to replicate something and then see if you can think of your own things to make from there. 
1	Yes, sometimes it tends to happen.. If I'm feeling like creating something, but am lacking some kind of emotion, feeling or energy to put into it then I can't really get the results I want and that makes me feel frustrated. Even if I do try to attempt it, it will never feel good or right in my eyes. I then choose to wait until I can find that inspiration that I'm seeking for and try again. Once I do find it though, I go all out no matter how long it takes me. 
5	Isfp dating advice- Help!	---intro\nHi Im a male college student who's been pursuing a female a my school. Please read all of it and tell me anything you think!\nSo, there's this girl I've gone on 1 date with, and have talked to for 2 and a half weeks. She was in one of my classes last semester, but we matched on tinder recently, and that's how we linked. For the first week after I match with her, we have great conversations over text. Things go great. She not only responds but also makes a deliberate effort to carry on the conversation unlike many women I match with. After the week I start snapchatting her and get her Instagram as well as her "finsta." Things seem to be going too well because I had considered her "out of my league," but my friends tell me otherwise. So I eventually ask her out and she agree to the date, place, AND location without hesitation. (Wow?)\n---Red Flag 1 (the night before the date)\nI considered this girl really special because even though she was really attractive, she didn't seem like a party animal or a "hoe." The night before the day of the date, she suddenly edits her profile on tinder, which she hadn't done in the timeframe since we matched. She switches up some pictures and adds "down to party so hmu! (heart emoji)" Then she proceeds to post a video on her finsta which is basically a recording of her semi-embarrassingly showing off a hickey on her neck. Caption is "Wild throwbacks from the past." Yes girls can have their fun too, but who posts that kind of stuff on their Instagram, and what is the point of doing that? It just bothered me. \n---The day of the date\nThe day of the date comes, and we are supposed to have lunch. She arrives 15 minutes late, but that's okay as she apologized. She is gorgeous and VERY into me, to the point that I'm thinking, "Am I that attractive?" Constant eye-contact and smiles, everything goes great during the date. We both agree that we want to see each other again. But during the date, I did run into some things that bothered me. \n---Red flag (during the date) \nFirst of all, her age is fake, and she never mentioned it. It says she is 19, but she's 18. That means that she's had a tinder account for at least a year, while in how school. So curiously, I ask some questions about her past experiences. She says she's had her "fair share" of messing around on the app, which I interpret as hooking up people.  When asked about relationships, she says she's had three serious relationships. To me this just doesn't add up. I've been thinking she was this nice innocent good girl, but now she's suddenly a 18 year-old who's had 3 serious relationships, who's hooked up with enough guys and now wants something serious. But she's only 18? If my interpretations are true, I would never date this girl. \n---Red Flags ( after date)\nSo as soon as I get home, I snapchat her saying how I enjoyed her company would love to take her out again. She responds after 8 hours, around 1 oclock, because apparently she had been partying all night. However, her snapscore has gone up at least 100. Then she posts another photo on Instagram, with her and another guy with his arm around her showing them having fun. This post is captioned, " Tonight was wild (heart emoji)". The man in the photo comments, "(heart emoji)" At this point I realize that she may not be the person I pictured, and is probably seeing other guys too. \n---continued\nSo We've been going back and forth on snapchat for a bit now. Her response times and steadily getting slower but at times she responds within an hour. The thing that bothers me is that she is on snapchat all the time, and I can see when she last opened the app because she is visible on snapmaps. Her score goes up a fuck ton everyday, but she seems to take her sweet time not reading my snap and responding after a millenia. Another extremely weird thing I noticed is that when I check where she is through snapmaps around 10-11pm or even later, she is at different places each time. I'm talking about 3 different towns and cities. Sometimes she's in the middle of fucking nowhere. My pessimistic and insecure mind just pictures her fucking a  random dude in a car or an apartment everynight.\n---Conclusion.\nI know I overthink and seem insecure, but this dating game just drains me too hard. Whatever comes up to your mind after reading this, please comment. I need whatever I can get. Advice, support, guidance? Anything. Help. I really want to learn from this experience. \n
3	Run!
2	I would advise you to move on. The only goods points about her from your post seemed to be that she is attractive and paid attention to you. The red flags you mentioned, are factors you shouldn't ignore. 
2	You sound like you liked her more before than afterwards when you truly knew what her nature was. It also sounds like you are constantly being put under stress with this person and I don't think that's healthy for you. I too think that you should learn to move on because it doesn't sound like she is too into you, more like just leading you on. Has she ever gone to you for guidance or talk to you about serious matter or things that she feels about inside? That's usually a sign that they trust and take an interest in you. Or does she just mostly want to have fun because she is lonely and anyone's company will do for the experience? It's like she is causing you more harm that it should and it shouldn't be like that. If you don't like or want to play her mind dating games then don't. Staying more would just lead to more hurt and pain in the end on both sides.  Who knows, she could be thinking differently about you on the inside than the actual outside appearance. It sounds like you already know her enough to know what things you like and don't like, which you seem to feel more of.  If you don't like where you are standing in the relationship, then what reason is there to stay trapped in it? I mean you could probably still be friends and all, but I don't think this is the romantic relationship you were hoping to find and be in serous, long terms with. Why would you want to stay with someone who doesn't truly value their time with you? Someone who wants to know how you feel and shows interest in everything about you. I feel you should have gotten to know her more and finding out more of who she is as a person long term before asking her out on dates and such. You have got it backwards and are now regretting or contemplating about it for a long time when the answer is obvious. You want out and probably don't want to hurt anyone's feelings in the process, but that can be inevitable. You're probably going to have to talk to her about this if you feel that it isn't right for you guys to date anymore and for some closure on the matter. But you can still be friends, just maybe not the romantic type. Hopefully this has helped you to realize some of the things you haven't thought about before.
24	i love you	
14	I love you too bud. You post/comment a lot and I appreciate it. I started frequenting the sub about two or three weeks ago and like a third of the posts/comments that get put on here are yours. I'll likely be seeing a lot more as I have this sub favorited now.

2	have you had any dreams lately?	Or nightmares, if you are an unfortunate one. Can you remember what they were about? My last dream was a sexual one. Might be because I have been abstaining from masturbation. I don't mind these types of dreams at all.
2	Last night I was hiking with some friends when I realised I was dreaming. I decided to prove it to them by flying down the mountain. Then I walked up to a random chick and hooked up with her. It was pretty cool.
2	A nightmare. It was a classic staircase chase where you don’t know what you’re running away from but you know something god awful is coming for you. Probably had it because I watched Silent Hill before going to bed. 
1	Last night, nightmare. I was running late for work (typical of me lol) and I had to go pick up my sister. As I sped to her place, I turned into a very narrow road where the sides just dropped and it was filled with greenery and old broken down machines and cars. As I continue on, I see a big truck coming from the opposite side and going really fast. I try to back up but my tire gets caught on the side, I lose control and fall slowly. First, the back of my car hits a tree and I'm thinking "this isn't so bad, I'm not hurt yet and I can't see what's happening". Then the side smacks into a red car and it shifts my car so that I'm diving nose down. Panic hits and I try to bring my arms up to protect my head as I see the ground coming closer. It all happened really slow. Then it shifts to 3rd person and I see my arms trying to climb out and blood is slowing seeping out. I'm pleading for help and all the while thinking "I hope I don't get fired. I hope my sister is okay". I hear footsteps and an ambulance in the background. The sirens changed and I awoke to my alarm, breathing heavy. \n\nShit wild ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2	Why are most musicians-writers sensors?	I don't seem to find a lot of intuitives in this area, even when it comes to awesome music few people listen to (symphonic metal). I have this unsettling feeling that a "normal" people make "rare" music for "rare" people, which translates to "just someone trying to stick out". But in reality "normal and rare" is a very sleazy dichotomy.
1	It’s like 2 AM so I’m not gonna bother actually replying to this, but symphonic metal is lit. :D\n\nEspecially Delain and Nightwish.
3	what is your favorite animal?

2	That's tough.\n\nUsually my go to are Ravens\n\nBut I also like Chameleons about as equally
2	Cats
1	I can’t decide because I love them all so much.\n\nMaybe hamsters?
1	Albatross. A lifetime of just gliding across the southern oceans

5	Isfp in a relationship with an entp please help!	Okay so this is my first post on here so don’t judge me I don’t really know how this works, I’m a 25 year old female and he’s a 30 year old entp male we’ve been together for around 8 months and I feel like we get along well but our relationship is kind of shallow like we almost never open up about our feelings and things like that we just discuss things like we’re in a business meeting, I don’t know how I can take the relationship to another level emotionally I feel like after 8 months it’s still kind of shallow what do you guys think? 
4	Might get better responses if you post in r/entp! 
2	Hello. I am also an ISFP, & I have dated an ENTP. I had the exact same problem. We were together for 6 months before I finally realized that it wasn't going anywhere, & we broke up. We did a lot together, & it seems like a perfectly healthy relationship, but I just wasn't happy. I felt that our relationship had no meaning. Still better than when I dated an ENTJ, but that's another story.. Anyway, I am currently dating an INFP who fulfills me. I feel much better in this relationship. That all being said, I am not saying to just give up & leave. Are you happy? If you are, & just don't feel like you are getting everything you need, maybe talk to him about it. Any type is really capable of anything with enough effort. We can learn to be better at our weaknesses. However, if you really are not happy, it may be time to look for someone who you can better connect with. I really hope this helps, & you can DM me if you need anything else.
2	lol no \n\n&#x200B;
1	Familiar situation. My current SO types as ENTJ, we’ve been together for almost a year and it took us about this entire time to open up to each other. From my perspective (ISFP) I internalize my feeling/emotions and express them with touch/acts. And he’s pretty similar but also has a hard time opening up emotionally. Almost called it quits a couple of times, but that forced us to actually communicate our feelings & open up with each other so it’s been better since then. \n\nSo I would say it is possible to overcome and grow, if you’re both willing to be completely open and honest about expectations and mental needs not being met. It’s all about compromise. It’s worth having the conversation and trying to grow together. If there’s no growth after then I would just end it (personally) 
5	which generation are you?	The Silent Generation: (1925-1945)\n\nBaby Boomer Generation: (1946-1964)\n\nGeneration X: (1965-1979)\n\nXennials: (1975-1985)\n\nMillennials: (1980-1994)\n\nGen Z: (1995-2012)\n\nGen Alpha: (2013-2025)
9	Gen Z. I'm glad they finally pinched it off. 
7	I think the generations are getting shorter and shorter because of how fast everything is changing... I'm born in '97 but in no way identify with anyone born later than 99 so i'd say I'm a millennial... 
5	I am a 90's kid. I ain't gonna be part of your system.
5	Millennial 1986
3	This scale seems off...
3	Z\n
2	Millennial 1982
2	1998, so Gen Z. Tho in my country we had 90s things in the 00s 
2	[deleted]
1	Technically I’m Gen Z but I identify way more with millennials 
14	Some characteristic things in me. Does anyone identify with this?	I just wanted to share some traits I have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n• I have a terrible sense of location and I get lost in my city and in open world video games very easily.\n\n• If I get bored, I get depressed.\n\n• I like to express myself with drawings but I hate to spend a long time doing one.\n\n• I’m not super aware of changing details or the environment. Actually I never noticed many details.\n\n•  It is as if things always lack a little piece of something to be completely meaningful. No activity that I know fills me completely. No goal excites me enough because I always think something like “and then what?”.\n\n•  I always had trouble figuring out what to do to earn money. I’m 24 and I  studied 3 years of visual arts to left the university. Now I’m going to study to be a language teacher and a translator.\n\n• I can be very judgey sometimes.\n\n• I have stages of very good self-discipline, healthy diet, without missing excercise days, etc.\n\n• I can find it really hard to find something to say in a conversation, and also I have trouble speaking fluently.\n\n•  I am very clear about my opinion about trendy violent ideologies, and I can get quite angry that most people decide to follow the flock, or a trend, or the politically correct (that is actually harmful) instead of thinking for themselves and find a posture that is really good for society.\n\n• I sometimes can have quit rages with videogames.\n\n•  When I’m happy I tend to be very childlike when socializing or playing, and when I’m pissed off I can be very adult and a bit asshole. That makes me wonder about what my real identity. And I can never find the answer.\n\n&#x200B;
8	\- I am also a giant fucking douche when I get mad. I purposefully become petty and irrational.\n\n\- Only video game that has made me rage quit was Persona 4, and it was only once. That game is amazing but it can be a big bag of dicks sometimes.\n\n\- Couldnt care less about trendy stuff. People are gonna hurt each other no matter what their excuse is. Its just gonna be something new in a month anyway. Just unplug yourself for a month and you'll feel better.\n\n\- I also have random bouts of intense determination to do things. Usually lasts a month or two at a time, but I don't cheat for a second during that time. Still following my yearly go to the gym resolution.\n\n\-  I'm not judgmental at all. Though first impressions are never erased with me.\n\n\- Money is a means to an end for me. I couldnt fucking care less what im doing as long as my boss treats me the way I deserve to be treated.\n\n\-  I dont share the "And then what?" mindset at all. Im quite content with how things are going.\n\n\- I miss small details a lot unless its in my room. My roommate has trained me because that son of a bitch will never put something back where he found it.\n\n\- I just struggle to express myself in general. I dont talk much, and while I find myself to be naturally gifted artistically it doesnt interest me whatsoever.\n\n\- When I get bored I start breaking things. Nothing important though. I just start acting reckless. I like gambling too.\n\n\- I get hopelessly lost all the time. In contrast to that I have a shockingly good ability to retrace my steps without fail though.
3	I too get depressed then I'm bored. I can never just "relax & do nothing". Feels like I'm wasting my time.\n\nI'm usually not judgemental, except when I see someone parenting badly. Then it really bothers me, because I feel for the child/children stuck in it.\n\nAnd I am also childlike when happy, but I can be a real jerk if someone pisses me off.\n\nBut I don't share those other traits.
2	I don't relate to the drawings, sense of location, details and activity ones. Also rn I'm in an off stage with my exercise :(
1	I can relate

43	what do u guys think of this aesthetic?	
8	Here for it! (But you have to hide those desktop icons) 
5	This looks lit! I especially love the pink razer mouse. You can also change the color of the windows theme if you wanted it be fully pink
4	OMG GURL GAMER\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery aesthetic. 
5	Aesthethicc setup
5	I fuckin love rose water 
3	It’s adorable!
3	I'm a guy, and I would rock this setup. Totally aesthetic. Love it.
3	I don't want to stop looking at it!
3	I get your style.\n\nTo me, it's just lifeless. 
3	Omggg I’m in love 
3	LOVE THIS 
2	I'm curious about why the keyboard is so much to the left
2	Make everything black, replace the candle with incense and the rosewater with a couple fingers of bourbon, neat, take the ears off the headphones, get rid of those little ball thingies and those characters on either side of the screen, change the screensaver to early Black Sabbath, add a stack of cds and pen and paper for writing down random epiphanies/other notes, and I'm here for it 😂😂😂✌️
6	how do you become friends with an isfp?	
14	Have something interesting/funny/meaningful to talk about. Don’t try and reel them in with baseless small talk because they will immediately forget about you after. \n\nBe real and genuine and authentic. Don’t beat around the bush, just say what you feel. They won’t judge you (unless you’re being a bully or prick, which they won’t tolerate). Isfps love speaking with straightforward confident people who can just express themselves freely- no matter who they are. \n\nDon’t invite them to social events where you have to dress up and be fake and smile a lot- they will make an excuse not to show up to those.\n\nIf they’re going out drinking, it’s probably to a dive bar or a friendly, low-key neighborhood hole in the wall. There should be pool or darts or something to occupy them while you’re there. They don’t usually like to just sit places, they like being occupied. They despise dance clubs and loud crowded bars. \n\nMake them laugh. Tell them a dark joke.\n\nTalk about their favorite books and authors. \n\nHave a dog or cat for them to pet. \n\n
7	Just dont bullshit them. ISFP's tend to be able to smell bullshit from a mile away.
11	feed them their favourite snacks\n\ntry to understand them  - that's a huge want
5	Be genuine and give constant affirmation. Give support/advice when they open up. Do not disrespect or ignore them.
4	Hold kitty and wait. 
3	If you're interested in making friends with an ISFP, make sure to introduce yourself first and be welcoming. Don't be afraid to go up and talk to them because they aren't entirely sure if you like them. They don't like or want to impose on anyone. I feel that if you start to notice them and talk to them more often then they will start to see you as a nice companion to want to be around and start to open up to you a bit more over time.\n\nBe genuine and respectful, if you don't it can be misunderstood as a negative impact, like attacking them or going against them and will begin to lose interest in the person. If they come to find out that you were lying about who you are or lying about something repetitive it will lead them to not trust you anymore and even cut you out of their life. Personally, I prefer people who are friendly, good manner with good intentions who I'm comfortable with versus someone who is likely to always be negative with their surroundings. They most likely want to be given and receive the same respect and treatment as they have for you. I'll add that maybe most of them tend to be serious too. If they know you really well, they will laugh along with you if they aren't as comfortable around you then they won't find it as funny as you think it to be.  If they do make jokes, they will first find out what kind of jokes the person likes because they don't want to offend anyone around them.\n\nIf you have things in common that will make things much easier to talk about because they can be passionate about these things so get to know what they like. They don't really enjoy small talk and it's not very enjoyable. They prefer you share topics (like favorite things, family, songs, art, etc) with them to help them better understand you as a person. They can be sensitive towards people who like to gossip a lot and that can tend to be uncomfortable for them. They enjoy people who are very easy to talk to, individuals who aren't afraid to be in their company. That's because if your uncomfortable, they will know it and in turn make them feel uncomfortable too which will lead to a very difficult atmosphere to be in. Also, don't put them on the spot. Last thing they want is confrontation and conflict. This will probably make them tend or want to stay away or even avoid you if you approach them in that manner. Instead be warm, kind and understanding of them and their feelings because they will see that and appreciate it even if they don't tell you.\n\nAlso, giving them positive comments (what they were wearing that day that you like and noticed, what they do or done for you or others) will make them happy and feel noticed because they don't tend to share those things out loud.\n\nOnce you know what things they like to do, go ahead and share some enjoyable experiences with them. If you want to hang out, make sure they are available for it first and don't pressure them into it, give them time to think about it more, this is if they seem hesitant to answer and haven't agreed already. Plus, don't take it too personally or negatively if they reject your idea to hang out. There are many chances and opportunities in the future so don't let it get you down. I find that if you hang out with them more in person it feels more genuine to them then just talking over the phone or text.  If you seem demanding for things to happen it probably will not be good for you as they will start to slowly distance themselves and end up pushing you away from their circle.\n\n\*Key thing is to be patient, warm and gentle, truthful to yourself and to others, supportive and know that they will always be there for you even if they don't keep in touch with you often. They like and will choose to be with endearing individuals who will make long lasting, good potential friends who they'll remember forever in their lifetime, not the ones who want to use, go against and hurt them or just getting along for the sake of it, their bond is more deeper than that. If they like you enough, they will want to give or share with you thoughtful gifts or little things which they find you will like, much to your surprise. I think they give more than they receive in this way.\n\nIt probably sounds like a lot of effort... but those things will be worthwhile in the end and will make an ISFP feel to want and show more interest in developing a good relationship with you.\n\nIf anyone have any other questions, feel free to ask or PM. =)\n\n\*\*edit: I wanted to add that if you are trusting and accepting or tolerate of who they are, no matter how quirky they are then why not try and be their friends. They will immensely admire and value you and invest their time with if they find that this is true to your nature. The only difficult thing would be where to find one and if you're able to keep up with them. =)
7	gum	I pop open the lid of my Wrigley's Orbit White Spearmint Gum. I pour out 2 pieces that are white with little green speckles. I put them in my mouth one at a time. One piece for each side of my mouth. I chew down. The gushing explosion of minty sweet freshness fills my mouth. \n\nThe hard glossy outer layer of the gum slowly turning into a rubbery texture as I chew down on it. With each chomp, marvelous flavor pouring out. I can't control myself. I chew faster and faster.\n\n7 minutes pass, the flavor not as prestine as it once was. I reach for the container and pour out another 2 pieces onto my palm, ready for another trip into paradise.\n\n
5	These gum manufacturers prey on our better judgment.
3	Hahaha YES
2	Ugh. Gum always makes me sick because I chew too much.
1	i do the same, although too much mint gum makes me wanna off myself. now i'm mostly hooked on fruity flavored gum! gum is so exciting to me
3	What artsy hobbies do you have?	Took the MBTI test about 4 years ago and I was an INTJ. It felt pretty accurate at the time but a lot's changed. I was in my first year of college at the time. Boyfriend (ENTP) took the MBTI a few days ago I decided to retake it. My new result was ISFP. Based on posts I've read elsewhere ISFPs are creative and artistic in a non-tradiitonal way. Just curious what hobbies you all have and looking for ideas for a new hobby 
3	I love to draw, sing, play piano & violin, & pastry arts.
3	painting, drawing, piano, violin, calligraphy, and interior design are fun :) I wouldn't say I'm aRtSy in a non-traditional way though
2	Love art history(mostly renaissance stuff) and journaling. Nothing too extreme because I actually have no artistic abilities myself lol. I had to drop my animation class because I can’t draw :( love looking at art though 
2	Painting, drawing, hand lettering, ukulele, singing, piano, some guitar, percussion. \n\nI do all these things solo. I will sometimes play music and sing with friends but I am most comfortable doing these things alone. Sometimes I will record a song and let a select few people listen to it because I’m weird and about people hearing me sing, although I’m quite good. \n\nI also paint pet portraits for people upon request for money. It takes me a while to get one done and actually give it to the person. I have two finished ones that have been sitting on my counter for about a month waiting for their new owner. Lol I suck 
2	Painting, drawing mostly with charcoal, playing piano, silversmithing (new found hobby and absolutely in love), knitting
1	I like to watch Anime and play video games. Does that count? 
4	Out of curiosity, what are your zodiac signs? I’m wondering if there are any correlations.	\nMine is Pisces. 
6	Last day of Aries.
4	Sagittarius
4	Pisces-Aries cusp.
4	Gemini on the cusp of cancer 😊
3	I don't think you're going to find any true correlation primarily because our full zodiac profiles are entirely unique, based on exact time and location of birth (though my full profile falls completely short beyond my moon and rising signs).  I'm not saying zodiac is bullshit at all, but that theory doesn't draw the high T types that mbti/Jungian theory does so the more detailed descriptions are not only lacking but way off base. 
3	Cancer
3	Virgo
3	i’m a leo 
2	Libra
2	Libra
2	Scorpio
2	Scorpio 
2	Pisces
2	My big three are Scorpio, Capricorn, Scorpio 
2	Aries
2	Pisces!
2	I'm a Capricorn. But my gf swears I have the personality of a Pisces. And I've always identified with Pisces more anyways.
2	Pisces
2	Aries 
1	Aqua
1	Aquarius bitch over here
1	Gemini. 
1	Virgo 
3	Been playing around in the istp sub for a bit and an interesting question arose. What kerps your Se in check?	For me, it's self preservation.  I'm not going to put myself in imminent danger.  If things take a turn, I'll deal.
4	Also why can't I edit the title?! 
2	Sketching, Watercolor painting, cinematography, interior design, and discovering music 
1	The reality of the consequence keeps my Se in check
35	Me, when my kids are given creative or artistic homework assignments:	
4	I like your username.
2	I wouldn’t be able to commit to that sadly...😔\nI’d get too carried away and start using my child’s  limbs as the assignments structure...
12	Creating an ultimate ISFP playlist. What is your favorite song?	I doubt anyone has a favorite song. I know my favorite music changes based on my mood. I have been loving these playlists that keep being dropped on here. I want us to create a playlist of everyone getting to add ONE SONG to the mix. Just one though. An ultimate ISFP playlist. Seems like it'll be fun. I'll go first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts far from my favorite song, but I find myself listening to this one all the time.\n\nThe Dead South: In Hell I'll Be In Good Company\n\n[Here is a Youtube link to the offcial music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9FzVhw8_bY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I do plan to eventually pin this whole thing into a single playlist. I'll probably use Youtube since thats what most of these links are. I'm gonna give it a week for some stragglers to maybe come across it and drop their tasty ass jams. Fucking love you dudes that already dropped it and gave me enough music to eat my whole night though. <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: [Ultimate ISFP Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMypkp0qQOkTVjX2KHinLaAHOVvy7FF20&disable_polymer=true) There it is. There is our beautiful monster. I left off some songs mentioned below. Anyone who put down multiple songs I tried to select just one. I picked the ones that called out to me in the moment. I also selfishly added a second song myself. If you want to collaborate on the playlist you can use this link below to do so. If either link doesn't work let me know. I double checked and they should work.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMypkp0qQOkTVjX2KHinLaAHOVvy7FF20&jct=t9s5pAiPiyPn62BOwvhMoMaWw5ZN4A&disable\_polymer=1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMypkp0qQOkTVjX2KHinLaAHOVvy7FF20&jct=t9s5pAiPiyPn62BOwvhMoMaWw5ZN4A&disable_polymer=1)
8	Wow, I can't pick a favorite. Maybe for my more emotional moods, God Only Knows by The Beach Boys is good. My happy moods or even just when I'm branching out are way different 
7	Do you realize?? - the flaming lips 
6	(Are anime songs allowed?) \n\nIdk but I'm in love with this song right now. I'm not even sure if it will become one of my long time favorites, but right now it is a song I keep coming back to. \n\n[Mako Niina - Sensen no Realism](https://youtu.be/SrX5kYg1Pwo)
7	Soul To Squeeze - Red Hot Chili Peppers
5	https://youtu.be/_tcW-j7KFgY\n\nLateralus-- Tool.\n\nCan't commit to a favorite song, but this is up there, and the album is my favorite.  Bonus bcs Maynard is also isfp.
3	I have boatloads of favorite songs, although I've recently been stuck on "I Won't Look Back" by Fireflight and Zahna's entire album *Red For War*.\n\n*Fireflight - I Won't Look Back Link:* https://youtu.be/8Qzu57dhZJ0
3	Too many songs to choose from! My main playlist on spotify has 560 songs...then I got a hip hop playlist with 220 and a Lofi one with 150 songs. I also have one with British rap with around 100 songs. I got an anime playlist which isn't on spotify and let me not even mention all my other smaller playlist haha. There's just too many good songs to choose from!
3	This one's an oldie from Keane that I love the feeling of. But I reaaaally like all of their songs, there's no song that I say "nah this won't work for me".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THzJsylwOL8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THzJsylwOL8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	[Mgła - Exercises in Futility I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BqGgqyfLCs)
3	[For Your Precious Love](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GgDqnykX3Bs) by Otis Redding is sexy af 😌
2	This one would have to be my favorite. \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ehKvpIc3HEs
2	Not my favorite but    Destination by nickel creak  gives of isfp vibes
2	[Black Market Eyes by Ron Gallo ](https://open.spotify.com/track/7jMQwK4ITimJ8x4s9SthsY?si=PbBLSeIsQlyngJZI9vpxpQ)
2	Hmm,  interesting topic. Look, I think we need to classify them by moods. One playlist for when you're happy, another one for when you're sad, another one for when you want a hype.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't choose only one x')
2	What an interesting project :D Here's my contribution: [Ljósið by Ólafur Arnalds](https://youtu.be/mYIfiQlfaas).\n\nAin't got a favourite song either but this track does occasionally pop back up in my mind. I find that both the song and its music video are so comforting and beautiful.\n\nIf anyone here hasn't listened to it before, I hope you'll enjoy it too!
2	Boyish - Japanese Breakfast
1	Famous Prophets (Stars) - Car Seat Headrest :)
3	when was your first kiss?	
4	when I was 11, in 6th grade with my first "girlfriend" 
3	Also when I was 11, with my then crush.
3	when i was 18, a few weeks before i graduated from hs. the guy was a lil older (now I'm 22 and he's 27). we've been together ever since ♡\n\nit was really a perfect turning point in my life considering how much hs sucked for me haha
3	Just before turning 21 :| 
2	Junior year. Had been hanging out with a girl for a few weeks. Was out at my favorite fishing spot with her. She made the move. Ended up not fishing and made out for a while. Had no idea what to do, and was too scared to try anything fancy.  Also it clearly wasn't her first rodeo. Yeah. Turns out she never even liked fishing. Split up after high school. Probably for the best though. Looking back I would have certainly gotten a Dear John letter. Better off having those memories untarnished.
2	I was in 6th grade and had a crush on a guy I grew up with and knew he liked me too. We were playing truth or dare and my friend dared him to kiss me. So he goes ok can we practice first. So we went to the back room and he kissed me. Then we went back to the game and he kissed me again. 
2	Kindergarten. I was 5. 
2	15 😩 it was okay, I really wasn't prepared for it honestly but thinking back on it it wasnt so bad 
2	When I was 21!
2	17, it sucked. I spent 5 years with him and he never got any better at it
5	made a sad-ish playlist	https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkwjwfxxcz8c76Z4IHVBd84d
4	How do you realize that you're an ISFP and not an INFP?	I did like 30 tests and almost all told me INFP, plus 3 told me ISFP. People in Reddit typed me as ISFP, so now I'm curious about how did you figure out your type. They say that ISFPs are more physical than INFPs.\n\nI perceive in me some things that aren't pretty physical:\n\n• I don't perceive details nor am I very observant.\n\n•Almost every day I come up with new ideas for creating memes lol\n\n• I'm not good in any physical skill, I really suck at mechanics, drawing, etc. I even break things inadvertenly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan I be a weird ISFP with low Se?
8	You're an INFP.
10	If you come up with different ideas every day, you're an INFP. If every day you play with the same idea (or little set of ideas) you're ISFP.
3	INFPs have polr Se, and ISFPs have polr Ne. Who bothers you more, ENFPs or ESFPs? One of these types is your ‘supervisor’ type, whose dominant function is your ‘kryptonite’. It could provide some clues as to your actual type.
2	I tested for years on free tests as INFP.\nI just did a real mbti and result came back as ISFP! \n\nAlmost right in the middle of S and N.\n\nI always remind myself that it's a scale. We are capable and do function using different ways when we adapt to life
1	I just  did the kisa.ca test - this bit might help  \n  \n>Differential diagnosis:\nISFPs are less fantasy-oriented than INFPs. These types are often confused, however, INFPs lean strongly to daydreams, poetry, prose and more philosophical pursuits; ISFPs often live out 'id' experiences rather than writing or even talking about them.
5	Participate in my MBTI Survey	Researching the theory of subtypes.\n[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WMhQAkegNdJ-A3xJcFrW-nFWrr7GmA0hZas0JV9VNgo/edit#responses)
19	Facts	
6	[deleted]
4	I think I know what you're getting at, but can you explain it anyway? 
3	My ex was an ENTP and oh boy sometimes the communication styles were just not reaching each other in the way intended lol
3	One of my best friends is an ENTP, and this is pretty damn true. We don't clash often, but when we do we clash hard. I understand every word coming out of his mouth. It all makes perfect fucking sense. Its like. I'm sorry I don't eat all the carrots I make, but they make the plate look more appealing so they have to be there. I understand that its a waste of food, I understand its a waste of money, I understand it makes no sense, but it makes me happy.
1	I’m not impressed with the fact that by God of War lore Kratos defeats this Guy...\n\nThat means you’ve killed one of my people...\nThat means I still don’t give a shit because it wasn’t me you killed at the end of the day! 😁
3	Speaking of entp, check this out. It's an interesting pov read and I'm curious how accurate you all find it.	
9	The thing about not looking at other possibilities and being blind to our futures is wildly inaccurate. And giving us praise isn’t going to make us love you. We are not blind to manipulation which is what I feel like this whole post is doing but disguising it as “social engineering”.  It simplifies us, saying we’re easy to manipulate “if you can’t social engineer an ISFP, you won’t be able to do it at all!” Like wtf? What happened to having genuine interactions with people
2	Very condescending. 
16	What are yall's current jobs/careers?	I'm 24 and I feel so lost when it comes to what I want to do as for my career. I feel like friends around me have already  somewhat kickstarted their careers and have kinda figured out what they want to do, and I feel like a loser. I feel like I'm getting older and at this point, I should know what I want to do and work towards it, but honestly I dont even know where to start. I have a lot of passions/hobbies and talented in the things i have passion for (isfp thing?), but I don't know how I feel about making them my full time career. I get burnt out/bored easily on passions when there is pressure put on them like making money, etc.And I am someone who always second guess myself and think i'm not good enough because im superrr critical of myself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are my fellow isfp's jobs right now and how do you balance your job and passions? Did you make your passion your job or do you keep them separate?
13	ISFP, 27 - I'm an engineer, but when I'm home I read and write psychology. The stable engineer pay helps ensure that my artwork is not affected by the pressures of money.\n\nYou just gotta try different things if you don't know what you want. Primary Fi will help you decide what you like and dislike. And when you find something you like... Find a way to practice it, even part-time!!
9	I'm a music teacher, so I chose a path the entails my passions. \n\nStill never feel good enough though...
6	I'm a web designer, when i finished studying i realized i hated it, because i had to satisfy client shitty demands all the time, so then i did an entire IT carreer, when i finished it i realized i hated that even more, i disliked the enviroment.  \n\n\nSo i'm 30 y/o now and i'm taking charge of my dad's business now, i never thought i would be doing this. I don't dislike the job but when i get out everyday i do my own things ;D
6	I was in sales. I hated it and was awful at it \n\nNow I’m a law student. Not sure if it’s quite right for me. I love helping people, but it’s a very rigid profession and 70% of lawyers are ESTJ. I hope I can be successful. The study is very interesting, but the cut throat environment is demoralizing \n\nAt the end of 1L year, I discovered that my true passion is psychology. Had I known that sooner, I’d have skipped law and instead go for an LMHC. I think I’ll still do it though and maybe become a counselor for lawyers and law students, or get into expert witness testimony 
4	My source of income is my IT job as a Business Analyst. I don't love it but it pays the bills and allows me to work on a flexible schedule at home. And because of that, I'm able to volunteer for a mental health organization which fills all the meaning and fulfillment I cannot find in my job, lol!\n\nDon't worry about feeling lost and scared to start. I think as ISFPs, it's hard for us to not feel bored doing just one thing. The important thing is we allow ourselves to try those that interest us. While it feels great to be an expert, vertical growth and longevity in one role aren't always where success lies. \n\nJust get yourself out there! You'll be fine :)
4	Right now I’m working at a daycare with 2-3 yr olds. Never thought I’d be doing this, as I’ve never been one who is good with kids. Turns out I am, not the best, but I’m not as bad with them as I expected myself to be. But this is just temporary, my plan is to go to school for sonography (ultrasound). I think doing ultrasound is like, a perfect mix of my talents and interests and goals. \n\nOn the flip side, my parents used to encourage me to pursue art. I’m really good at art, I like doing it, but it’s my hobby and doing it as a requirement is not fun for me. I get orders on Etsy for drawings and while I enjoy doing them cause it’s challenging, I could never do it as a full time job. I’m not the kind of person who can turn my hobby into a job and enjoy it. It just sucks the fun out of it.
3	Outdoor educator. Teaching people how to hike/camp in all environments! It doesn't pay much though so I'm serving tables right now. 
3	I feel the same way. I deliver pizza and manage at a Papa John’s. I feel like I’m the odd one out of all the other managers there though. I am also in school. I have the same struggle with deciding where I am going to go next and sometimes it overwhelms me to think about it because I don’t want to stay making pizzas forever. 
3	Soon to be dentist. Not my passion by any means, but I wanted a job that would let me pursue my hobbies on the side (namely, writing). Sometimes I regret it, but I'm far too deep in now to give it up.
3	Homecare nurse. I absolutely love it. I love the elderly and I love working one on one with no coworkers and I only know my supervisors through their voices on occasional phone calls. My passions include helping others which I obviously do at my job, and I make time outside of work for my sports/dance/acrobatics. 
3	Backend Software developer but on a big years long project. I like it a lot never gets boring. Must add that I think working on smaller (webdevelopend) projects would suck. We always try to write beautiful code and have the time for it so thats a big plus!
3	Honestly, I used to feel the exact same way...just feeling lost in life and lost in which direction to take with my career. I always felt so much fear in possibly ending up on the wrong path.\n\nThe best advice I can provide is to just go out there and apply for jobs. Experience is the best way to figure out what you like to do and also for figuring out what you are good at. Make a list! Also, stop comparing yourself to others! Everyone is at different stages in their lives.\n\nI didn’t find my passion until age 24. I’m currently a flight attendant and I’m in love with my career. I love the constant changing environment, the sense of adventure, being able to meet new people all the time, and learning new cultures. Through my past experiences, I learned that I’m really good at customer service and enjoy learning about safety. I wanted a career that allowed me to help people but I did not want to be in a constant depressing environment (example: nursing). So just go out there and through each experience you will get one step closer to a career that works for you. Even if it doesn’t work out, it’s a learning experience. \n\nI’ve also learned to stop mixing business with personal. When you are at work, you are there to work. It may not always be a joy but that’s because it’s work. Learn to find something that is bearable and not soul-sucking. For other things you are passionate about but not related to your career, do those on the side. You may also make a side-business out of your other hobbies if possible. Otherwise, just enjoy your hobbies on the side.\n\nI wish you best of luck! I remember how stressful it was so if you need someone to talk/vent to, feel free to reach out :)
3	I draw, and I am looking into expanding that onto a career as a tattoo artist. I have also been working on a comic for a while now, but it is more of a pet project.
2	Software engineer, former esports coach.\n\nI'd say I usually drive work from my passions, which either works out extremely well or burns me out rather quickly. Over time I've learned that if you plan on making work your life, you'd better have some really relaxing hobbies.
2	I’m a mobile software designer but right now I’m only managing my e-commerce. I make no money but it’s fulfilling and fun. For now. 
2	24 as well, I just started working private security last month. Before that I mostly did retail and warehouse/stock stuff, which was alright but not a good fit for me. \n\n\nSecurity is good for me because I'm a pretty tall dude and I'm fairly polite, but at my current job none of that is super important- for the most part I watch cameras or patrol a facility in a car. I mostly work graveyard shift and don't interact with anyone other than a few co-workers. Lots of my co-workers are the opposite of intimidating, so don't worry about trying to fit a stereotype if you're ever interested in this job. \n\nWhen it comes to full time career, I want to do something else. Currently looking into becoming a firefighter or possibly joining the military if the firefighter thing doesn't work out. Last year I spent some time studying to be a certified personal trainer, but I haven't studied for that in a while. I might get around to it eventually, but I'm not sure I'd like it.\n\nI never got a degree and probably will never get one, so anything that requires one is off the table for me. I tried for several years in community college, but I just couldn't succeed there. For a long time I was depressed about this, but lately I've started to realize it doesn't matter and I should be doing something physical since that's what I'm best at. I would have loved to be an art or language teacher though
2	I am a pastry chef. When I was a kid, I always wanted to open a bakery, & I eventually did. It is one of my passions. I also make time to draw & sing. I've always worked enough to get by with some spare cash to do whatever I like, without working so much that I push my interests aside. I don't need to be rich. I just need to be alive & happy. Good luck to you!
1	I (25F)  just finished my job as a carer for a girl with SMA. Now I’m starting a new job as a nanny.  I find these jobs suit my needs on a moral level as I feel like I’m having a real impact on people’s lives and I’m not selling myself out. \n\nBut I always have hobbies to keep me going and fulfilled. Right now I’m getting into ethical, plant based fashion design, and oil painting.  
1	I'm 27. For the last 3.5 years I've been working as a data analyst, and about a year into it I realized how much I *don't* like it. I've struggled through it because it's a "real" job as society sees it and I guess I didn't know what else to do. So a few weeks ago I finally got the courage to quit! Honestly I feel so free, this has been the best decision ever. At the end of this month I'll be done with it. \n\nI don't have a new job yet but I'd honestly be happy working as a shop assisstant or waitress for a while and just be *doing* something rather than thinking so much. Also interacting with people more. As much as I'm introverted I love to be around people. \n\nMy plan though is indeed to turn my hobbies into work... I don't want to become dependent on any one of them as I still want them to remain fun, and I don't want to take the passion out of them. I am a silversmith so would love to teach that, give piano lessons. And I want to to a yoga teacher training this year and teach. I'm hoping to find a balance between all of them and I think the variety is good so that I don't get bored of any one thing. (is that an isfp thing?). Also I want to teach english to kids, I got certified last year :) \n\nAlso, I just want to say, take it ease on yourself. I've struggled with the feeling that everyone around me has their shit figured out except for me but honeslty, it always looks better than it is from the outside, you don't really see their struggles either. And even if they have figured it out and you haven't, that's totally fine. I think that there's only a handful of people that are lucky enough to know exactly what they want to do, for the rest of us you kinda just go with the flow until you find it. It's hard to accept but hang in there - who says we need to have everything figured out and by when? It's just unneccessary pressure we're putting on ourselves. And actually I think that once the pressure is off, you will actually find what it is that you want to do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
9	Career Venting	Seems like every year or so I repeat the cycle of hating my current career and wanting to end it. By the time I’m able to quit I’d be at 11 years towards my retirement. \n\nI have to admit I’m almost never happy with what I do but I stay because:\n\n1) it’s a career that forces me to be stable \n2) it’s a comfortable life when it comes to pay \n\nI just feel really miserable. I’m at a point where I thought I loved it and I wanted to deploy etc but now that all of that is upon me, I’m thinking about the time I’ll miss with my son and the constant stress and anxiety.\n\nWhat would y’all choose? Stability or a perceived chance at happiness? \n\n
6	Stability. I’m not reliable enough to go for my dreams. 
6	I just left my second grade. I came to realize that I want a stable life without worrying about my fucking job. I was trying to put my passion into a job, but that vanished my passion. I don't like to create a product, I like to create art.\n\nSo this september I'm gonna start a new grade in Administration so I can work from 7 to 3 and do my passion in lovely afternoons. \n\nI'm with you, buddy. We all live in the same planet afterall 🤗
5	Right there with you and my resume shows it.  I have about 1-2 years experience at each job.  It’s pretty wild,  but I finally found a great job and great company.  I’m approaching 2 years and don’t have the COMPLETE urge to quit... move to the mountains... work at a small grocery store... read a lot of books and go hiking... UGH.  It sounds so appealing but I know I need to stick with a good thing and set myself up for a graceful retirement.\n\nThe big thing for me is to continue pursuing my passions/projects.  This job gives me peace knowing I can still do that and not feel like I gave up.  Plus, it’s a fantastic work life balance.  I’m pretty much my own boss and spend a lot of time alone with little splashes of human interaction throughout the day.
4	Suggestion:\n\nGet a stable job that is stable, but has fixed working hours!\n\nI personally work a day job from 8am to 5pm, Monday to Friday, and when I'm home, I practice my art (I write).\n\nThis way, I get to practice my art without it being tainted by the pressures of money\n\n~ISFP\n\n
3	The only things I require from my job are:\n\n1: They let me work at my own pace. I'll get the work done. I only cut corners on things that don't matter to me. My well being that comes with my paycheck matters to me.\n\n2: They ask me instead of tell me to do extra work. I will fucking quit on the spot. Im irrational when Im mad. I ain't about to be someones bitch.\n\nand 3: I get paid on the same schedule without fail. If its gonna get delayed thats fine. Just let me know.\n\nChoose happiness dude. Its a harder life, but its a happier life.
1	Stability. I’ve pursued happiness my whole life and now that I’m older and have children, I worry everyday about their future.
2	Choice <3	If you were without choice, what meaning would love have? If it were a forced thing, how deeply would it mean? No, love must be given, freely, and of one's own heart.\n\nSometimes, no matter who we are, or what we do, we will never feel like we are enough for some people. Sometimes, we may never feel accepted, or understood, or even loved. In the end, some people may never love you, and, that's their choice.\n\nThough, just as it is our choice to love, as is it God's, and there is nothing you can do to make Him love you any less than completely. He has chosen you. The breath that fills your lungs are evidence of this; You are alive for a reason, for a purpose only you can fulfill. You are special, you are unique, you are chosen, and you are loved. There is so much depth to you, and so much creativity and healing you can bring to the world, in the way only you can. You are loved, and you are loved just as you are.
1	If predestination was/is real, we could still love. Imageion an author writing out the thoughts of a character in a story, it doesn't change the fact that then the character/person felt something even if it was predestined/God knew beforehand.\n\nThe person is the story still had choice, but that choice was already written. It's what I believe at least, food for thought and God bless
6	Any similarities between ENFJ’s and ISFP’s?	Hello ISFP’s, \n\nFellow ENFJ Here! I was wondering are there any similarities between an ENFJ and ISFP! I don’t know any ISFP’s so I was wondering if there was a lot of similarities between the two! Thanks! 
2	Well there’s one letter for starts 
2	Well, I don't know any enfjs in real life, so this is conjecture.  \n\nAssuming functions are valid, we both operate on the ni-se axis, which, if I understand it correctly, means we might make one particular observation and with that observation, a depth of understanding about how it might have come to pass and what it means.  Essentially, we're both able to make profound, convincing, potentially eye opening observations.  We'd probably have some pretty intense conversations.  I'm married to an infj, who of course also operates on ni-se, and we get pretty out there... more so because since he's ni dominant, he can really riff off my random "what if this" questions.  But I digress.  I think, like your introverted counterpart, our differences are more important and more complementary.  You're able to make sense of and even normalize the things that I feel make me so unrelatable, and maybe I'm able to help you realize your own individualism outside the needs of the many people who are so drawn to you.\n\nMaybe.
1	ENFJs and ISFPs both use Se and Ni, and both have a dominant feeling and inferior thinking function. That's about it, I guess? \n
1	Hi there ENFJ, I'm an ISFP (from Malaysia)! \n\nMy girlfriend of 8 months is an ENFJ, and so-far, she's been the best match for me. She gets a little annoyed with me sometimes cuz I'm a little messy (I like to leave fresh laundry on the couch and use it as a pillow), but she quiets down when I make her fried-chicken 😋\n\nI think that ISFP and ENFJ are very different, in the sense that ISFP are very individualistic, while ENFJ are more community oriented.\n\nThe similarities (as mentioned by another commenter) is that we both have the same perception axis Se-Ni. This axis allows us to perceive time as linear and chronological, always starting from now, and moving forward. People of Ne-Si axis do not naturally perceive time this way.\n\nI hope this helps a little or at least serves as an interesting read 🤗
1	Thank You So Much! 👍🏻 I appreciate your help! 
6	does anyone else sometimes has the sudden urge to express themselves in the comments in reddit with a lot of curse words or making posts with a lot of stupid proposals?	such as for example writing posts for r/shittyMBTI or simply commenting in any other subreddit using crude language just for the sake. I find a fun in that and even necessary. I never insulted anyone, but I enjoy coming with stupid plans or ideas or using a lot of swear words. Especially when it comes to express myself and how I feel with something. That's what makes me feel satisfied and funny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't consider it trolling, because I don't pretend to deceive anyone. I simply say what I feel without censorship. I think that's what makes me strangely happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfuck MBTI.
2	yes, I used to do this sort of stuff a lot - never saw it as trolling either but it was always called that :P I was always just messing around for fun
16	is there a single good trait that isfps possess?	every post here is just like: isfps push people away, struggle to maintain relationships, struggle to create meaningful relationships, struggle to put thoughts into words, struggle to stand out from a crowd, insecure, socially inept, perceived as boring, struggle to express and feel emotions, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera\n\nAnd I fit into all of these, and my life feels like a total mess
14	Im ISFP and I feel like Im strong in most of these. In fact, this seems to be so far removed from me its laughable. I have life long relationships with friends since grade school. Most of my ex girlfriends are still part of my life in positive ways. I love formulating words from passion into something I can say to others that may be hurting. Which i would say is our strong suit. Granted im terrible with reading and writing. I've taken 3 mbti tests and all ISFP, so Im not sure how we compare but there is an underlying issue Im sure you are not sharing. I will give you this, i dont require tons of friends, infact 2-3 close ones at any given time fits me well. Within my close group of friends Im far from perceived as boring.\n\nReason posts here are asking those in depth questions and the glaring ones is because people like to figure out and have resolve instead of sharing positive aspects I suppose. sorry if this came off as arrogant in anyway, but its important to note not everyone is the same just because we fall within the same parameters. It might just be flipping a switch and learning to carry yourself a bit different.   
10	A single good trait? How about not being dependent on constant human contact? This is perceived as a negative by a lot of extroverts, who think (hope?) that deep inside we are the same attention whores, who are either just better at hiding it or are too inept to even try. I can't put into words how happy I am to not share this suffering, that I constantly see in memes lately. Somebody thinks I'm boring? [I'm sorry](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CorMZxdXYAApIya.jpg). Good thing I've got enough people in my life who think otherwise, and even if I wouldn't, I'd still be far from suicidal.
8	I have all of these traits in my nature but they don't define me. I'm also logical, introspective, great at being content with very little and living in the moment. Not everyone likes us, but those who do love us. We're known for our wisdom and ability to see all sides of an issue. We have plenty of strengths. There's a lot to be proud of.
6	Well, we're all at various levels of health and maturity, and many isfps are also enneagram 4 and when that's unhealthy, it can come off as self loathing.  At some point though, it all depends on the cause and effect of your proclivities, like, are you pushing people away out of a fear of intimacy, or are you taking control of who you allow into your life?  A lot of it is just shifting your perspective, for instance, come to listen and learn, not to initiate and express.  And embrace your wierdness.  I promise you, you *are* standing out from the crowd and while it sucks to feel so constantly misunderstood, you have the power to harness that for good and create something truly moving, and it doesn't have to be for anyone but yourself.  You have it in you.  You just need to give yourself a fighting chance, and if that means a little more introspection, indulge that, indulge it often, because you have the ability to really know who you are from  all angles, and a strong sense of self is a wonderful thing to go through life with. 
4	Basically, I think I'm awesome and it's not my problem if no one else does. 
3	I'm a 27 year-old ISFP and I'm loving it!! \n\nI have a stable 8am-5pm day-job that pays okay, and when I'm home, I practice my art (writing)\n\nI guess it sucks that we can't naturally speak out in groups or in public because of low Te and Ne, but thats the only drawback I see.\n\nCan you even imagine having a dominant function other that Fi?? Just thinking about it gives me nightmares. I understand myself well, and act upon my likes and dislikes to the extent that I can, and that keeps my subconscious in place.\n\nAnd not to mention the Se-Ni axis allowing us to see reality as it is... It's fucking great being an ISFP!!
3	Dude. We all feel like a total mess. Thats what makes us great. Its really easy to empathize and understand others when you constantly shit can yourself. Its our game. Its my game at the very least anyway.\n\nIf I had to put one quality that we all share I wouldn't know what to say. We are ISFP's. We aren't the same person. Shit. I'm a different person based on my mood. I could tell you the best quality about myself and see how that fits into your belief of yourself. I hardly doubt thats what you're looking for but here goes.\n\nMy best quality is that if you treat me right and reciprocate my loyalness then I will be never endingly loyal. The funny thing is is that I will be loyal to people I know damn well aren't good people. If you treat me the way I think I deserve to be treated then you will have a friend you can call to help you bury a body.
3	While I am pretty awkward socializing with strangers, I enjoy socializing with my close friends. I am not inept. Just picky. I'm also very expressive & like to stand out from the crowd if the situation is right. I don't anyone would call me boring. I was voted "most unique" in middle & high school. And definitely none of things about relationships apply to me personally. I am in a very strong & healthy relationship with an INFP who is my very best friend. I could be wrong (fellow ISFPs can tell me if I am), but I don't think ISFPs are BAD at those things persay. Just bad at them with the wrong people. I can say that I used to think I was bad at relationships. Turns out I just didn't really like the other person as much as I told myself I did. Since meeting my fiance, that has completely changed. We both give our best to the relationship, take care of each other in equal measure, almost never argue, & the entire thing just feels so easy & right.\n\nAll introverted types tends to struggle with these things, feelers just tend to notice it more. ISFPs are more likely to have their own little world & pocess more quirky personalities. It's hard to let just anyone into that little world.
5	u/flashtone is right, most of the time people post because they need help on something, either about an ISFP or as an ISFP. I think this is the case for other subreddits as well. There are so many positive traits that ISFPs have and I as an ENFP often wish I were more like you guys - independent, sensitive, effortlessly artistic, funny and interesting. Also, unhealthy people of any type will struggle, just in different ways. Hope you feel better soon!
2	ISFP are incredibly relaxing. I’m dating one now and whenever I’m around him I just mellow out so much, which is super refreshing to my harsh SJ. They are very easy going, go and don’t often make demands of you. They are also super sensual and utilize touch in the best way to express affection 
1	i used to fit into all of those too, but i think being a healthy version of your type just comes with maturity and growth. i was toxic af when i was younger and now i can look back and recognize it. also (i can't stress this enough) SELF LOVE AND SELF CARE is so important. everyone, and every type, has positive qualities even if they're still growing ♡\n\ni used to hate everything about my type, i mean sensors and feelers (especially fi-users) get made fun of so much by the mbti community. but i love being an isfp. i love being sensitive, spontaneous, artistic, and empathetic. do i wish i could be an ESFJ or ESFP some days? is it difficult to remember my self-worth when im literally surrounded by thinkers? of course. but we are who we are and all we can do is make the best of it.
11	Eye ess eff peas-- what's your take on our level of logic and rationalism?	We have a bad rep for being overly subjective and emotional but for me, everything I believe has to pass a truth test, be it moral, experiential, or empirical, and I think that's the way it is for many of us because Te (assuming functions are valid).  So it's not like I just latch on to some arbitrary notion and call it my truth.  I appreciate and value cold, hard fact and logic, but I can't seem to think linearly enough to get the words that come out of my mouth match the string of info in my brain.  Maybe a sign of true intelligence is the ability to properly articulate all that.  I would never subject myself to a debate, but I'm a lot more satisfied learning than relating, which ironically is the point of this post-- to see how my fellow isfps feel about our rep and what really goes on in our heads.
15	I feel conflicted having isfp as my type because of how logical I perceive myself to be, especially when it comes to morality. I'm a practical thinker and a scientist, I've always been great at problem solving and seeing all sides to every issue. However, I'm hopeless at articulating myself. I don't understand how all this relates to my isfp but I don't have a solid understanding of the complex interplay between different traits.
6	I feel similarly to both concepts. I enjoy debating (online) because it helps harness my Te. My bf is INTP so I kind of get less emotions and more logic when he's around. Lots of Thinking friends now that I think of it.. almost exclusively.\n\nI definitely find myself being a very emotional person. No matter how much I enjoy logic and reason, I find it hard to handle when I lead Fi.
7	My brother is an ISFP and he's very logical and interested in the truth. But he figures it out based on his own experiences, if that makes sense, while other MBTI probably figure it out with other functions (as Ne dom for example, I like hearing about other peoples' experiences). 
5	I'm a very logical person but I do have sting emotions and emotional awareness. They are not mutually exclusive in every situation 
1	it depends on the issue for me. i will argue the hell out of a personal conflict or a moral issue because i feel like those things are our strong suit. but don't ask me to debate economics or anything like that; all i know how to do is turn it into a moral issue so it can be debated.
7	In a sigh of the universe	 \n\nsome thoughts can flood my room so easily.\n\nI never knew how to swim in that river.\n\nHow much is very lonely?\n\nI dreamed that the glow of a smile will shine beyond the end of the last atom.\n\nSometimes I like to think that there is something that will not be swallowed by the darkness of nothing.
1	deep.
39	What do you guys think of my living room? ✨ CCW!	
5	Most folks here are pretty critical because we're ISFPs! I think this is beautiful, at least in the top 10% of rooms I've seen.
7	It's alright but I'd much prefer original artwork on the walls. The room needs warmer lights, thicker curtains on the outside with the sheer in the middle. 
4	Beautiful! Only thing I would add are some plants!!! Bring nature indoors. I’ve found that having inside plants just lift my mood and make me so happy!!!
3	Awesome table :) Personally I'm not a fan of "decor for the sake of decor" (store bought mass produced decorations/cushions) but I'm a bit of a horder when it comes to antiques and sentimental items so I'm in no position to criticize. If they're special things which have meaning to you, then they're great as they are
3	I would love to see more brightness in the room since it's got so many dark and muted colors. 
1	It looks comfy! I like my walls a little more plain, but it does seem cozy! :)
1	That looks lovely!! Maybe you could introduce one accent color into the mix like a darker/bright purple? A pillow + a wall decoration in something that pops could easily add some flair! I love what you have going already though 
1	It looks super cozy and chic, I love it. This has always been my style but I just bought a new house and I think I want to try a minimalist look lol 
54	Lately I’ve been feeling like Mbti is a pointless hole to nowhere.	Risky post but no regrets.\n\nNot to be super ISFP, but all the extreme speculation within MBTI forums are starting to feel silly / pointless to me. I used to be a lot more interested in mbti, but now it just seems like a lot of us are obsessing over something that we feel like Myer-Briggs types gives us, when our types just don’t do anybody justice. \n\nI think the most harmful part about mbti that I’ve been seeing, is how people overgeneralize others based on their type, even though there are literally SO many other factors in play to why they’re that way (to the point where it’s not even funny). I also think if you define yourself strictly to the inconsistent descriptions circulating the net about your type, you’re gonna brainwash yourself into thinking you’re supposed to fit into that mold, as if you’re getting assigned an identity rather than going out and finding it yourself.\n\nSure, I’m glad people have found fun in it, or have found people to relate with, or have found it useful for their first step in self-awareness, but it’s (sorry,) just a little silly how much time we spend trying to define ourselves (and others) according to these types. \n\nEven the enneagrams. For those who follow it, I got 5w4 and read multiple times that it’s “almost impossible” for an ISFP to be a 5w4, unless they’re an IS**T**P. But who made these rules? How are logic and emotion mutually exclusive? And who even cares at this point? \n\nAt one time I was, by habit, typing everyone in my head after being subbed to r/mbti and this sub. Then I very quickly started feeling really silly about it. Now, I’ve taken it upon myself to notice the key, defining traits about others and stop there. I also make sure to not hold any of these traits against them (because they’re subject to changing and are allowed to change themselves as they grow, and I also acknowledge that I might just be misunderstanding them). \n\nI still like this sub and will visit from time to time. But I just needed to bring up how ironic it is that mbti, originally designed in hopes of helping us understand ourselves a little better, has become a somewhat misleading, messy, and emotional “group think” array of conversations
27	I encourage all ISFPs to never feel like you can’t do something because you’re an ISFP.  Do whatever you want!  Grow as a person and move beyond that. When I was typed as an ISFP in college (2007)  I was kind of confused by it, but it made a lot of sense based on who I am/was.  Understand your TENDENCIES, strengths, weaknesses and grow as a person -  that’s the fucking point of MBTI.  Don’t say, “Oh, I’m an ISFP so blah blah blah...”  Be YOURSELF and don’t forget to keep growing as a multidimensional person that is so much more than a stupid outcome of a test.
12	I agree with this! It definitely isn't as deep and all-encompassing as others claim it is. It's just a nice framework.
11	People on mbti are overanalysing 
6	Thank you for writing this, it needed to be said. All of it. \n\n>Risky post but no regrets.\n\nWhat's life without a little risk eh?\n\n>Not to be super ISFP, but all the extreme speculation within MBTI forums are starting to feel silly / pointless to me. I used to be a lot more interested in mbti, but now it just seems like a lot of us are obsessing over something that we feel like Myer-Briggs types gives us, when our types just don’t do anybody justice. \n\nYou're factually correct. None of these types do anybody justice. They're a four letter shorthand for *four words* that are only the tip of the iceberg for who someone truly is. Putting people in a box based on their mbti type is a huge mistake and it does them (and yourself) a huge disservice. \n\n>I think the most harmful part about mbti that I’ve been seeing, is how people overgeneralize others based on their type, even though there are literally SO many other factors in play to why they’re that way (to the point where it’s not even funny). I also think if you define yourself strictly to the inconsistent descriptions circulating the net about your type, you’re gonna brainwash yourself into thinking you’re supposed to fit into that mold, as if you’re getting assigned an identity rather than going out and finding it yourself.\n\nAlso correct. The generalizations and stereotyping gets tiresome. The sheer amount of assumptions people have made about me because they see "ENTJ" in my user flair is astounding. I just ignore it, there is zero point in wasting my time attempting to reason with people who are seriously trying to stereotype me based on a *fucking mbti personality type*. The level of superficiality is truly a sight to behold though, in the sense of, "wow, isn't that a delightful cesspool of hydrochloric acid!" kind of way. Pfft. \n\nI understand in a cold, detached, academic kind of way why people feel the need to define themselves strictly by their mbti type. A lot of factors go into it. For many people, especially online, they're young. They don't know who they are and they're massively insecure and they find some comfort in the label, it gives them an anchor at a time in their lives when things are often extremely chaotic in both their internal and external worlds. But it's also a very bad idea, personality doesn't fully mature on a purely scientific level until a person is well into their 20s. So, naturally, mistyping is *literally inevitable* if you're below the age of ~25 or so. \n\nThe other reasons people define themselves strictly by mbti type are sadly not so innocent/benign. It's because they're vastly unhealthy for whatever reason(s) and they're clinging to their type as an identity for many reasons. There's *a lot* behind this and is frankly beyond the scope of this post so I won't go into all of it, but there is that playing into it also. \n\n>Sure, I’m glad people have found fun in it, or have found people to relate with, or have found it useful for their first step in self-awareness, but it’s (sorry,) just a little silly how much time we spend trying to define ourselves (and others) according to these types.\n\nAgreed, I'm glad people have fun with it too and find it useful. I've personally found it to be a highly useful tool for self-awareness and personal growth, and for understanding other people. But the important thing is that *self-awareness and personal growth and all the rest of it cannot begin and end with mbti*. \n\nYou're right, it is silly. \n\n>Even the enneagrams. For those who follow it, I got 5w4 and read multiple times that it’s “almost impossible” for an ISFP to be a 5w4, unless they’re an ISTP. But who made these rules? How are logic and emotion mutually exclusive? And who even cares at this point? \n\nOkay, that's utterly absurd. How is that "almost impossible"? Good lord, what planet are these people on? I'm an 8w7, typical for an ENTJ, okay so what? What if I was a 4w5? Oh, I bet that would cause an uproar! \n\nThis is just getting arbitrary at this point. For fuck's sake lol... I'm actually laughing because what in the ever loving fuck are they talking about? An ISFP can be a 5w4! There's no rule against that! None whatsoever! \n\nLogic and emotion are *not mutually exclusive*. Literally nothing is black and white. Good lord. \n\n>At one time I was, by habit, typing everyone in my head after being subbed to r/mbti and this sub. Then I very quickly started feeling really silly about it. Now, I’ve taken it upon myself to notice the key, defining traits about others and stop there. I also make sure to not hold any of these traits against them (because they’re subject to changing and are allowed to change themselves as they grow, and I also acknowledge that I might just be misunderstanding them). \n\nYou're ironically displaying ten times more logic and rational thinking than the average NT that's active on r/mbti. \n\n>I still like this sub and will visit from time to time. But I just needed to bring up how ironic it is that mbti, originally designed in hopes of helping us understand ourselves a little better, has become a somewhat misleading, messy, and emotional “group think” array of conversations\n\nThe irony is not lost on me, either. Again, thank you for posting this. Very wholesome, we need more content like this around these subreddits. 
4	If people would stop using it as an excuse to be an asshole, it would be more fun/interesting.  
4	I agree 
3	Interesting. Looking at this is like looking into the future for me. I’m still at the point where I’m typing everyone else and still trying to figure out how this relates to me as I have been typed as INFP as well, and recently ENFP.  \n\n
3	It is. People take it too seriously and make huge generalizations through it. It's cool and fun to read about it but you have to take it with a grain of salt. 
5	Don't mistake the community of people with the knowledge that can be obtained. There is a "people element" to virtually every community out there. How people use a tool does not suddenly render that tool less valuable/useful.\n\nBut if you're here for the people, then maybe it's not worth staying.\n
3	I 100% agree! I definitely think as a genuine framework, it can be helpful in understanding ourselves and others. But it can also be a little horoscope-y at times. 
2	INFP here (or INFJ, still not sure), also an Enneageam 5w4 and i agree: the mbti sub seems to be full of misconceptions and people defending silly interpretations of the type. Just yesterday an INFJ tried to argue that Fi doms can't be good at logical reasoning (cause inf Te and shadow Ti).\n\nI don't know what keeps me from leaving this place. Also I took a quick look at this sub and discussions seem to be more civilized than in the mbti or INXX subs. Sadly I'm no sensor :( sometimes I wish I would be one. 
2	I'm an INFP, and I sometimes think this. I feel like being too invested in MBTI can make you forget that it's just a personality system - and people are still people. \n\nI hate that I've started thinking of people in terms of their personality type instead of just seeing them as human beings.  
2	Ive been thinking about this exact thing for a long time now. Its nice to hear about the positive aspects of yourself(it may not apply to you tho)but the thought of giving myself a type is unnerving. I dont wanna be forced to conform to some label. I like being who i am. Its a love hate relationship with the MBTI but i cant deny that it helps you to find a place of people who think similarly but NOT exactly the same. We all have small nuances that makes us unique but the MBTI doesnt really cover those. We need to find them out for ourselves.
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/mbti] [Lately I’ve been feeling like Mbti is a pointless hole to nowhere.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/an4oej/lately_ive_been_feeling_like_mbti_is_a_pointless/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	Thats exactly how an ISFP should feel. Otherwise you're a phony.
1	I think anything can be misused. MBTI, iphones, computers, politics, etc.... you continue the endless list for me. I use it pragmatically. I don’t like the stereotypes either. I tend to fit perfectly in an ESTJ and enneagram match up and there is even a fictional character like me. Hahaha! What’s the chances hahaha! But I dislike stereotypes. I have this very pragmatic way I look at MBTI. This theory doesn’t float in mid air. It has to connect somehow. It matters how you use your tools. I’ll take politics another concept. You can’t just theorize about using power or you’d come up with something like the republic. Philosopher king really? Reality check please? Also same with MBTI. This is why I see functions as strengths and weaknesses and rather focus on the possitive parts. I also don’t go around thinking about mbti all day everyday. I’d go mad! I always like to link it to solid things that I can grasp at. Practical knowledge. YOu can have all the knowledge you want of MBTI but is this sound logic? Is this real stuff you are researching is it applicable?\n\nSo yeah, I agree. I wouldn’t say the tool was useless. It’s sometimes useful but don’t think about it too much or all day every day.
1	honestly, it is. for so many years i was looking to mbti to tell me who i was. i kept mistyping myself because it always just felt like something was missing. then i gave up, developed my sense of identity simply by doing things i love, came back, and was all like, "oh duh im an ISFP." it's a weird process.
0	You're exactly right, but your title is not very correct... It simply depends on what you're doing with it. What you're describing is using MBTI wrongly enough to cause all of those problems.\n\nBut MBTI imo isn't stupid or useless, pointless. It opened the path for self-discovery, self-improvement, understanding of others and of the human psyche in general, and much much more. That to me is invaluable, and I'm not even using it to box people around, if you use it for understanding, you will never box anyone.\n\nBut there is also a scientific, psychology side to it, and that also isn't pointless. It helps give you additional perspective into the psychology of humans, and see new concepts arising from old ones. Discovering the psyche, where it can go, its limitations, working with the functions to understand new concepts such as the flow of time being perceived differently, wondering about the unconscious and the shadow functions... It's marvelous.\n\nI mean, yes, your post is completely valid in the sense you meant, and we could use MBTI to go so much more deeper somewhere, furthering our understanding of the world, ourselves and others... And we're using it for dumb categorisation and stereotyping, for fun dumb downs, not even furthering the theory, merely stalling in it. Because yes, MBTI is not a complete theory yet. 
4	would you recommend me series	it could be anything. but if it's anime, please not shonen. 
1	Orphan Black is one of the best I've seen. A good anime is Overlord, if you've never seen it. Also, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It's old but there's a 2018 remake.
1	Terriers
1	Plastic memories and also the movie A Silent Voice is amazing as well
1	The Haunting of Hill House if you want spooky. That show made my skin crawl.
1	This is us if you like drama. It's the most honest depiction of family and relationships I've ever seen. 
1	Hunter X Hunter is shounen that might change your mind on the genre.
1	I don't have an anime series to recommend you because I'm unsure or unaware of what types of genres you like.. But I would recommend an anime movie that I found so compelling and the art is quite beautiful. The anime is called Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms. It's more on the fantasy side. =)
1	I recommend Youjo Senki. Although the art is a bit off in some characters (imo), I'm pretty sure the main character is an (insane) ENTJ so it could be pretty interesting to watch for an ISFP, since they're our direct opposites (unless you really don't like war series).
2	What is your bed time routine?	😪
32	ISFPs don't do routine, lol
8	I don't have one, I just go to bed when I'm tired 
8	When I have school or anything else the next day: 11PM\n\nWhen I have nothing: 2:30AM
7	I always try to start routines, and I’ll keep them up for a couple days, but then I fail  :(. Ideally I would like to go to bed at about 10:30 since I need to wake up at 5:30,  but it’s currently 12:03 AM here and I just finished a major assignment that was due at midnight, which I’d forgotten about until about 10:45. This is a common occurrence and it’s EXTREMELY rare that I go to bed before 11:45. Night time is rushy time lol.
6	I go to bed and lay there all night not being able to sleep
5	I feel like this is something I don't share in common with a lot of other ISFP personality types I talk to. I can fall asleep with just a moments notice and sleep like a log. I have never struggled to fall asleep. As far as my routine is concerned. I lay myself down an hour or two earlier than I need to so I can have conversations with myself for a few hours before drifting off naturally. Socks on off/boxers on off/fully dressed/butt naked I couldnt give a fuck about any of that. It depends on my mood when I get there. On my back/on my side/cuddling my pillow that depends on where my conversations take me.
3	Man oh man. Can of worms is what this is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been trying to find the right way to fall asleep for years.  For me, I need to not drink coffee after 12pm. Regular exercise.  Limit alcohol.  Read a god damn book and put my fucking phone/laptop away.  Drink a bed time tea (holy shit how did this happen, I'm old as hell now).  Take some melatonin if I'm not tired and need to get to bed so I'm not a fucking zombie the next day.  \n\nIf I do need something to watch to unwind I've been watching that 80-something year old grandma play Skyrim (Shirley Curry).  It's my safe place and is very comforting for some reason.  Helps me sleep if my mind is still racing or I'm overly anxious at bed time.\n\nThese are a few of the things that have helped me.  Which sucks because it requires a lot of work and it took time to get to this point.  All that said, I still have shitty nights of sleep and all sorts of stuff like that because I love staying up late.  That doesn't work well with an 8-5 big boy job though.
3	I sleep
2	10.30pm every night except when I'm out with people
2	what does a bedtime routine mean. i do skincare before bed does that count
2	Hard to stay in a routine but a good day is\n\n1) put the little one down on time\n2) take a long bath \n3) read/watch a show to start the unwind\n4) meditate  
51	Ugh..	
2	Is Roulette anyone elses game at the casino?	I just love the high risk high reward nature of the game. It is also much faster than trying to grind value on a blackjack/craps table. I mean sure. I'm better than your average bear at both of those games, but Roulette can payout 35 times to 1, and it takes like one minute to place the bet and see if you hit.
5	wow. i guess not all ISFP’s are the same. i absolutely detest gambling. but if i had to, my game of choice would be low stakes blackjack— since you can take your time, maybe finish an entire cocktail, you’re just killing time till dinner.\n\nmaybe this is more a girl/boy thing. or an age thing. 
2	I've only gone to the casino in video games, but yeah:P I actually don't mind black jack, but when I play with friends I'm usually just fucking around and there to socialize, so I don't pay much attention to my cards
2	I would rather sit in a bar nursing an overpriced and terrible tasting bottom shelf scotch whiskey by myself at 10am than play any casino game.  In fact, I have.
3	made a hype playlist	when you need some hype in yo life\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkyfYRh_7QHe2hHVemzUjtsL\n
3	thanks bro i needed it.

6	Have a nap!  Yes!!  
20	What do you like and dislike about every type?	(Sorry if I already did something like this in the past, I'm a bit bored) \n\nINTJ:\n\n\n+I can get along with them rather easily, behavior-wise I'd say I'm way more INTJ than ISFP. Conversations with them are fun and interesting, I also tend to share interests and sense of humor with them.\n\n-Can be a bit too uptight sometimes, immature ones are rather annoying (feelings are for the weak (basically denying their Fi), /r/iamverysmart behavior, etc) and their constant need to be working on something can be exhausting sometimes.\n\nINFJ:\n\n+They have this whole cool "wise old person" vibe going on, I enjoy that. Often very wise people. They're not really judgemental. \n\n-The INFJ doorslam. Are either really nice or really nasty. Can seem rather cold when they "turn off" their Fe and rely on their Ti.\n\nINTP:\n\n+Laid-back. Don't really judge you unless you do stupid shit. Will *listen* to most things you have to say. \n\n-Rather apathetic and hard to communicate with.\n\nINFP:\n\n+Very friendly and interesting people. Basically the more warm and dreamy INTJs. Very open minded.\n\n-A little prone to fall into the "woe is me" mode and fall into a spiral of self-pity. Can be a bit pretentious (*too* open minded) from a PoLR Ne's perspective. Well, maybe I worded that a bit harsh..\n\nISTJ:\n\n+Rather laid-back. They're rather relaxing to be around with.\n\n-They tend to hold grudges REALLY badly so I tend to be rather careful around them. A bit too grumpy sometimes.\n\nISFJ:\n\n+Generally very friendly. Keep their promises and don't forget things like so many other people do. Very helpful.\n\n-Tend to be a bit too selfless sometimes for my tastes, infodump a TON during conversations, can do the "either jesus or satan" thing the INFJ does. A bit boring.\n\nISTP:\n\n+Good sense of humor, laid-back, easy to talk to, pretty friendly (seriously their friendly side is underappreciated).\n\n-A bit hard to have "deep" conversations with. Sometimes seem a little oblivious. \n\nISFP:\n\nNot sure what to say here because in my eyes it'd be basically reviewing myself. If I have to two things though, ISFP girls are the best and I find some ISFP's attempt at trying to be all artsy and hipster rather cringy.\n\nENTJ:\n\n+Seem rather cool. Get shit done.\n\n-A bit too focused on getting shit done, it seems like there isn't much more to them than that. Rather intimidating. \n\nENFJ:\n\n+Very friendly and understanding. \n\n-Too selfless and focused on other people for my tastes, can get really annoying (basically most /r/2meirl4meirl posts). \n\nENTP: \n\n+Sometimes funny. Will *listen* to most things you have to say.\n\n-Tend to be very snarky, sarcastic and intimidating, often attack Fi views in the most aggressive way possible. Nobody can tear someone down harder than an ENTP. \n\nENFP:\n\n+Very optimistic, friendly, energetic and fun. \n\n-Can be a bit tiring to be around after a while. \n\nESTJ:\n\n+Goofy sense of humor. \n\n-A bit too focused on getting shit done, it seems like there isn't much more to them than that. Rather intimidating. \n\nESFJ:\n\n+Generally friendly. \n\n-Very unaccepting of things they deem weird, generally a bit fake, gossip too much and don't really respect alone time. \n\nESTP:\n\n+Somewhat cool. Their ability to adapt to any situation is pretty impressive. \n\n-Can be very intimidating if angry at you or unhealthy. Unhealthy ones are probably the worst people to encounter irl. The douchebro bully stereotype is 100% true for those.\n\nESFP:\n\n+ESFP girls are **hot**. Very fun and easy going. Know their friends very well from experiences and go much deeper than people give them credit for. They bring out the best in me.\n\n-Sometimes a bit too energetic, I'm rather lazy so I don't really want to do that much stuff. A bit too focused on the real world, don't really enjoy things like games and anime most of the time. Unhealthy ones can seem a bit like unhealthy ESTPs.\n\n
2	To be honest, I don't know anything about any of the other types, besides ISFPs and INFPs. Too lazy to read up on them. Might do so some time later. 
2	Oooh, this seems like fun. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTJ:\n\n\+ Just the right amount of talkative. \n\n\- Sometimes know-it-alls, jump to conclusions a lot that aren't always true without being able to convince them otherwise. \n\nINFJ:\n\n\+ Can be insightful sometimes. \n\n\- Self-congratulatory, cares too much about others and what they think, very manipulative in my experience. \n\nINTP:\n\n\+ Hilarious, especially when they don't try to be. \n\n\- Hard to talk to. \n\nINFP:\n\n\+ Honest, creative, really easy to talk to. I have yet to meet an INFP I don't like! \n\n\- They can get attached pretty easily which is a little frightening at first. \n\nISTJ:\n\n\+ Really interesting people without actually trying to be. \n\n\- Hard to talk to. \n\nISFJ:\n\n\+ Really warm and welcoming. \n\n\- A little basic sometimes.\n\nISTP:\n\n\+ Also really funny the same way INTPs are. Fun to be around. Really good teachers, not condescending at all. \n\n\- I agree that it's hard to have a "deep" conversation with them. \n\nISFP:\n\n\+ Relatable people lol. \n\n\- Stubborn. \n\nENTJ:\n\nAgree with what you said. \n\nENFJ:\n\n\+ Inclusive. Always brings people together. \n\n\- Can be a bit too concerned with other people.\n\nENTP:\n\n\+ Wild imaginations, usually pretty funny. \n\n\- Unapologetic. \n\nENFP:\n\nAgree with what you said for this one as well. Also -- ENFPs are usually absolutely bonkers, at least the ones I know. This is both a good and bad thing lol. \n\nESTJ:\n\n\+ I don't really know this type. \n\n\- Above. \n\nESFJ:\n\n\+ Friendly, fun. \n\n\- Loud, kind of cliquey. \n\nESTP:\n\n\+ Literally a walking party. \n\n\- I actually don't really have anything bad to say about them. \n\nESFP:\n\n\+ Good company sometimes. \n\n\- Judgmental, self-centered. 
1	all said in general, not obligatory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFP:\n\nlike: good companion.\n\ndislike: maybe a bit hippie, spiritual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFJ:\n\nlike: maybe a good listener.\n\ndislike: i don't know, but maybe too much followers of social consensus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISFP:\n\nlike: good companion, some of them artistic, some of them easy going.\n\ndislike: some of them get fucking angry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISFJ:\n\nlike: don't know. kind.\n\ndislike: very attached to what others think, don't think by themselves as they could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTJ:\n\nlike: practical still theoretical.\n\ndislike: i don't know. boring?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTP:\n\nlike: majority of them nice, on to talk, they like my ideas of conversations, like my jokes, don't get fucking mad at me.\n\ndislike: some of them are so fucking cold and despise attempts to approach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISTJ:\n\nlike: don't know. responsable, but what does it do?\n\ndislike: fucking serious people also seem to hate me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISTP:\n\nlike: they don't fuck, don't bother. simple and direct. easy to work with them.\n\ndislike: don't know. may be bloastful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTJ:\n\nlike: silent and direct.\n\ndislike: i don't know, maybe boastful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENFJ:\n\nlike: don't know.\n\ndislike: easily ofended, sensitive. we can not understand to each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENTP:\n\nlike: they talk, also have good amount of things to talk.\n\ndislike: some of them are fucking annoying in internet always trolling. they can't be serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENFP:\n\nlike: guys easy going, also have good amount of things to talk, optimistic, warm\n\ndislike: girls are fucked up and weird.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESTJ:\n\nlike: i don't know, they get shit done, i think.\n\ndislike: violent, intimidating, some of them loose mouth, think they have the right to be disrespectful and also I would punch some of them in the face for being assholes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESFJ:\n\nlike: they fulfill their tasks so it's good to work with them.\n\ndislike: some girls are very typical, flat on mind, and selfish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESTP:\n\nlike: they can tell you how to do or how to reach a lot of things I sometimes need.\n\ndislike: prone to crimes or fucking with risky things. annoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESFP:\n\nlike: they turn on conversations.\n\ndislike: some girls are whores, some guys may be fucking annoying.
11	Just woke up from a cool 10 hours, myself	
3	sorry that my posts aren't that interesting	Having a hard time falling asleep, only got about an hour of sleep and I have to wake up in 4 hours. This happens a lot the night before a big day. I have my intake today at the mental health clinic. Hopefully all goes well. \n\nJust going to listen to my playlist since falling asleep is impossible at this point. Here it is just in case you wanted to listen.\nhttps://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwripFCiEgkx55cvq12dI4uyGEvCS1WGa\n\n
4	Don't even think that, man.  You're livening it up in here.  Love and light to you today ❣️
2	Sorry, I've only just seen this. Thanks for sharing. I really relate.  \nI think you can train yourself to stop giving a shit, but in doing so a part of you dies.  \n  \nIt's unfortunate how many compromises are made in order just to get through sometimes. I don't have an answer.
7	How do you know that you are not an INFP?	I usually score in the middle on mbti tests for S vs N, and T vs F, and on cognitive functions, I usually score high on both Se and Ne, but slightly higher on Se. Clearly, I know something is off, but for some reason I just cannot grasp which function I truly use more. After reading into it a lot, I was fairly certain that I was an ISFP, because I’m very practical for the most part, and am very interested in sensory artistic experiences (music, cooking, some sports, etc. as opposed to activities such as writing or drawing which I find insanely boring) and intuitive descriptions don’t seem to fit me well.\n\nHowever, my mom has recently gotten REALLY into Myers Briggs (specifically the C.S. Joseph videos on YouTube... she’s basically watching them all straight through), and she said that she is 100% certain that I’m an INFP. I don’t have a very good sense of self perception, and how others describe me usually surprises me because it’s not in line with how I typically view myself. So I guess it is possible I’ve mistyped myself.\n\nI absolutely love INXPs, and many of my best friends are of this type, but I’m not sure that that is what I am. So, since I know ISFPs and INFPs are pretty similar, because we all lead with Fi, how do you, as an ISFP know for sure that you are an ISFP? 
6	I'm not entirely sure, if functions are indeed invalid, because my entire understanding was based on that and shadow theory.  My preferences are split nearly 50/50 f/t and s/n and no description of any "complete" type ever fits 100%.\n\nI'm not altruistic.  \n\nI require hands on experience to fully grasp an understanding of a system.  \n\nMy beliefs must be supported by either personal experience or empirical truth; in fact I have a hard time taking anything touted as belief seriously, because the "why" question needs to reconcile or else it holds no weight.  The spiritual/metaphysical is still fascinating and worth exploring because of its unknowns.  It's important to be open minded but no, anything is not possible unless we are living in some kind of matrix (but who can tell that? it's an endless cycle).  \n\nI love anticipation.  Once I'm actually there, the thing becomes surreal and I feel like I'm sort of out of myself.  It's very hard for me to be present, but physical sensation is very exciting to me-- a taste, a smell, the way something feels, a sound-- these are the things that make me feel alive.\n\nI've taken several tests and not once tested isfp.  I think I'm kind of a hard case, and it seems like a lot of us are.  Isfp was suggested to me once and the conversation I had with the person who suggested it leaned heavily on every isfp looking different, almost like the only common thread is that none of us seem to fit anywhere else; it's almost like isfp is the catch all for wierdos who defy definition.  Nobody really knows what isfp really means.\n\ntl;dr idk lol.\n
4	For me, I don't really like Ne and it confuses me a lot of the time. If I believe in or like something, I like to hold my ground and not consider any alternatives. In a way, following the Ne way of thinking feels like I'm admitting defeat or something.
3	You might be in the middle. Myers Briggs is a construct used to described the people out there, but it doesn't mean there aren't blurrings of lines or people who fall in between or out. I would say that you know yourself best and if you feel like you resonate more with an ISFP description then I'd say you lean more towards an ISFP but may not be as ISFP as others are. 
2	Someone wrote exactly what i am feeling lmao Down to the tee
2	I have the same problem and I am slowly digging deeper. I met with a counselor at school who was an INFJ and she was trying to figure me out while going through study techniques for both INFP and ISFP and her deciding factor for me was the use of the “Memory Palace” study technique, which I hadn’t used in the past. I am yet to continue digging but other than that I’m still on the fence as well 
1	because I read both descriptions and knew that I was an ISFP, the INFP didnt resonate with me the same way. 
3	Does anyone else	Run their finger across their arm when laying down, stare at the lines on their palms, hold their hand up in the air while laying down, run their finger down their nose while in a fist, touch their ears, stroke their hair, etc? Or something similar to those things? Sensations r cool.
4	Yeah. I’m *really* good at getting comfortable and sleeping anywhere because I’ve just learned to close my eyes and appreciate how comfortable every limb in my body is against my bed. I’ll be out in minutes lol. Or anytime I’m focusing on something, I’ll be tracing my jaw bone or poking that vein that pops out in my ankle or brushing through my hair. Sensations *r* cool!
4	Our bodies are fucking incredible.  I love running my hands over my own muscles, running, stretching, yoga, feeling my body move beneath its skin unencumbered and uninhibited.
3	Sensations are cool! This is only kind of related but did anyone ever imagine what swimming in a swimming pool filled with tapioca pudding or jello would be like when they were kids? \n\nI’m an adult now and still somewhat intrigued by the idea but when I was a kid and my dad would take me swimming, I used to think about what it might feel like to swim in a swimming pool full of my favorite foods. 
3	i really like the feeling of sleeping in my bed with new sheets. s a t i s f a c t i o n
6	Antisocial ISFP	Hi there , \n\nThis may sound weird , but I feel the need to write this here, because I am confused and I feel like I don't know myself anymore..\n\nI've discovered that I am an ISFP , and also I was diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder. These two are completely opposite. I am 24 years old and I have no friends , or good job . Sometimes I feel my antisocial side , I feel lack of empathy for others and I absolutely hate following orders, but I am trying to control this dark side of mine. I feel like I am in conflict with myself because of my antisocial tendencies , I don't want to be a bad person.\n\nSomeone else here with antisocial tendencies ? How do you handle that ? Thanks
7	The I from ISFP is from Introverted, i wouldn't say beeing antisocial is completly opposite from beeing ISFP.  \n\n\nEmpathy can be practiced , and there is no need to be wondering a lot if you are anti social or who are you or how you should be in my opinion.\n\nMBTI is fun cool and useful but i think one dosen't have to think it's an accuarate description of reality, people are complex, you can't describe someone just as "ISFP"
2	Read a word porn thing a while back.\n\n"I laugh when I see people trying to figure me out. Good fucking luck man. I can't even figure me out."
1	Just be who you are and forget about the analysis
32	Haven't drawn in along time! It was real fun. Not that good I'm but still quite happy with this :)	
2	Very nice
1	This is really good!
1	Hella cute, good job! :D
1	Amazing drawing of deku!! I love him haha\n-From an ENFP
1	Nice drawing! I did this same exact thing too starting out but with Naruto, my gateway anime at the time. Anime is awesome :)
1	This is a nice picture of Deku. He's also one of my favorite characters. \^\^ I'm still eagerly waiting for the new BNHA movie to come out. \n\nI also like to draw anime pictures too. =)
4	How is your 2019 going?	
4	It's a year of change for me. Left my boyfriend, and yesterday I decided to leave university. It was making me really sad.\n\nI don't know what comes next but hey, at least I will be at home.
3	Pretty dope. Haven't broken my yearly go the gym resolution yet. Best i have done in years honestly. Also broke into a haunted medical facility. Didn't see any ghosts, but it was pretty cool.
2	Awesome! Getting more productive each day :)\n\nHow's yours? 
2	Pretty fun and busy so far. \n\nBeen going to the gym with my friends 2-3 times a week on weekdays. Then literally having parties/hangouts every weekend since the year started.  \n\nAnd i just met a cute and funny ESFJ girl last week. Though i don't think i have been upfront and honest with their too much :/ .\n\ni think i could use some encouragement on that part.
2	fucked up. i've left university and lost my job. so i started to get depressed but now I see a light at the end of the tunel because this is a new beggining. Im going to unfuck myself.
10	Created a subreddit for SPs	I think there about 20-30 of us SPs who regularly comment on mbti related subs, so I created a new sub for us.  \n\nPlease subscribe to  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArtisans/ 
5	According to the internet I an ESFJ Are supposed to be #1 in compatibility with you ISFPs.	I’ve never met an ISFP so I wanna hear if anyone has met an ESFJ and why or why don’t you like them. Why would we be at the top of the compatibility chart? Why do you think I would like you and why you like my type?
4	I’ve met a lot of ESFJs (including my mom!), and while I love them, and they tend to love me, I personally couldn’t see myself being in a romantic relationship with one (although I wouldn’t necessarily be opposed!). ESFJs are nice, because I tend to look out for others and can end up kind of being “the mom friend” so it’s nice having ESFJs who will usually try to take care of me for a change. You guys are so sweet and attentive, and I really wish I had more ESFJs in my life!\n\nHowever, while I love having you guys as friends, I feel like if I dated an ESFJ, we would absolutely drive each other mad. You guys tend to be very structured and organized, are usually good with time management, don’t procrastinate, etc. *Im the opposite*. I’m literally never on time, *for anything*. I feel weird being early, so if I’m ever more than, say, 2 minutes early, I will sit in my car until it’s time to go in. Also, I’m very private with my emotions, whereas ESFJs tend to be more open. You guys typically feel better getting stuff out in the open, so if you notice were sad, sometimes you guys can pry a little to try to get us to open up, and while this is sweet and well intentioned, talking openly/showing vulnerability usually makes me feel *worse*, and I’ve noticed a lot of ESFJs have kind of a hard time grasping this. If I’m upset and don’t immediately open up, I usually just want some space. And finally, while I know introverts and extroverts usually go well together, I feel like ESFJs usually don’t like being alone, whereas I LOVE being alone, and the energy level might be a bit too big if a difference.\n\nAgain, I absolutely love you guys as friends, and maybe if I met a *really* chill ESFJ, I could date one, but in general, I think this match is kind of weird. Like, I think ISFPs and ESFJs typically have great chemistry and get along well, I can’t see that relationship working out in the long run.
3	I think because we're both feeling at the top and both have the same amount of sensing/intuition (just inverted) so we get along really well. ISFPs are playful and can be protective while ESFJs are really warm and sweet. 
2	I've met some, but they lose interest in me after a while and leave... Tho I think you're fantastic and determined people.
1	Lara Croft would be a good example. 
1	I'm an ISFP (female) and I was wondering about the exact same thing... ESFJ's tend to be more out there while ISFP are more in their bubble. I'm not quite sure if I've met an ESFJ in person before because I don't usually open up, talk and get to know others right away so I'm unable to really judge if the people I'm talking to is one or not unless they admit to me that they are. But as an ISFP, I'm socially awkward and may be hard to approach and can be misunderstood a lot.. But one thing I do know is that I do enjoy talking more with an extroverted person than an introverted person. Because if we were both introverts alone in a room, I would not know what to say to start a conversation and it would be very awkward silence for a bit until one of us takes the initiative to break the ice... But if an extroverted person comes along and starts talking to me, then I feel that I can listen to what they have to say and get to know more about them and their hobbies or whatever they want to share with me and that makes me feel included and happy. Then if they really get to know me and interest me, I find myself to be a bit more extroverted as well. But then again.. ISFP's enjoy their personal time being alone much more than constantly socializing because it is draining. \n\nI feel that ISFPs are probably more compatible to ESFJs as good friends than as partners in a relationship. That's just my opinion though.

7	Help? [RANT/ADVICE] [DEPRESSION] [maybe r/socialanxiety?]	I've taken many test to find myself here...\n\nI've always felt alone, but throughout grade school I was apart of every group besides the cringey ones. Mostly because I was too self aware to know what I wanted to look like to everyone else.\n\n(6'5 wide shoulder 200lbs decent face)\n\nI spent my whole life putting up a front I was Unhurtable. I was on ,  football team,  the rugby team, band. (Secretly in a computer science club) I had so many... acquaintances.\n\nNobody to me was my friend the way I wanted them to be. I never went to parties and never bothered to invite anyone over.\n\nIve started noticing my jaw gets tight whenever I was feeling exposed (which is everywhere outside my 15x15 room). I never have had a girlfriend, I cant even imagine sharing my secrets (my secrets being I hate being social and just want to be by myself or my closely trusted.)\n\nIf I'm not alone I'm not relaxed, the constant feeling of being punched in the face everytime I drift into a exhausted sleep.\n\nTo this day I've had my small routine to not want to kill myself. Somedays my imagination of my moms face if I was to kill myself is what helped my remain here. I'm angry that I cant even leave peacefully without thinking of the family I would hurt. I care so much for those that have shown care for me but I am too stubborn to show them how I feel and what I want. \n\nRecently I've questioned my religious beliefs. I asked God to talk to me to show me something that I'm not wasting my words that he is there.\n\nI've cared to much to regret nothing, that I havent lived.\n\nI tell myself that we view others on there action and that we view ourselves on our intent, but all I see is my inner demons.\n\nIf God wont answer me and I'm to afraid of regret to ask my Mom the one person I've ever confided in my inner thoughts what do I do.\n\nI'm posting this now before i edit so I wont delete it and be upset with myself.\n\nHow are am I suppose to live so alone.\nHow can I try to help others when I can't even help myself.\nHow can I view myself in a non self loathing way when I know I got my self in this mess along the way somehow.\nEven if nobody reads this or comments on this at least I've tried to change my veiw.
5	Hey, sounds like you're going through a lot right now. I've been in some dark places in my past, and I understand some of these feelings you're describing.\nHere is some truth: it is okay to ask for help and to feel confused. It's okay to change and it's okay to feel anxious in front of others. You can learn to own that part of yourself.\n\nI would recommend therapy. Every time I've been to a mental health professional I've done much better with figuring myself out. The right one can really appeal to the down to earth ISFP nature and your sessions can be super productive.\n\nInternet strangers can only know and answer so much. Professional counselors are really good at it!\n\nGood luck, and take care of yourself! We love ya.
2	I was somewhat like this where I was so alone and didn't see anybody close to me as a real friend. I wasn't suicidal, and I didn't considered myself depressed since I saw myself as fairly well off with little to complain about considering there were people who felt worse than me, so I didn't complain. I was just so alone..  I never actually fixed my situation myself, everything just sort of happened.\nI imagine our prayers were similar since our situation is so similar, but seemingly out of nowhere I got together with basically my perfect match, and got into the school I wanted, and both of these had such a little chance of happening that it was personal proof of God for me. And then everything just fell into place for me, I know who I am and I know where I'm going. It's incredible.\nBut the point isn't that god is the answer and prayer is going to bring you happiness, or a good school will fix your problems. I'm trying to say at some point probably sooner than your think you're going to find someone, be it friend or lover, and you won't feel alone anymore, and everything is just going to click and you'll know where you're going \n\n\n\n\nHopefully I wrote that good enough to understand, now I'm going to write my ps before I decide I don't want to comment this\nPs if you are ever really alone and just need a chat, I'm sure any of us are up for it. also don't be hard on yourself, it may seem like you could have gotten out of this situation at any time, but it's just.. difficult.

5	what mbti type do you get along with the best and the least?	Hi guys I hope you have a good day! answering my own question I get along very well with ESFP’s at least with my friend that is one because she always to understand every point of view even if she doesn’t necessarily view the issue the same way and I never tend to feel drained when spending time with her. I have a few friends that are ENFP’s and I get along with them fine but they do drain me quite a lot and I also regularly feel frustrated when interacting with them it might be because we view things differently so they might just feel as frustrated either what’s your opinion I’d love to hear it
4	Honestly? I tend to get along with most of the types pretty well most of the time. That said, I tend to consistently hit it off the best with other NT types and TJ types but, I’ve hit it off amazingly well with F types too! Particularly ENFJs, ESFJs, ISFJs, INFJs, ESFPs, and well I just found out my current voice instructor (I’m an opera singer) is an ISFP and she’s awesome! 😁 \n\nI’ve clashed the most with INFPs, ENFPs, ISTPs, and ESTPs, for whatever reasons. We just talk past each other and end up arguing (usually about something rather silly) for some reason and I’m always left wondering, “am I speaking in Russian or something? AAAHHHH!” 
3	I get along best with xNFPs and ESFx’s. Don’t get along very well with INFJs for some reason and ISTJs are hit or miss (but usually miss)
3	I'm married to an ISTJ, but we don't always get along (lol, yay marriage!),  I have and ISFJ friend who I get along well with, but find very boring though.  I have another friend who is ESFJ and she very likable and fun to be around. She also knows the right things to say to make me feel comfortable.  She has  ALOT of friends, which is really my only gripe.  \n\nI'm not sure about the other types, but I can tell you right now that I clash with anyone that has a hard on for the rules.  If they follow rules for rules sake and can't see any grey area, we gon' clash. 
3	I get along with everyone pretty well. The most noticible ones for me are 3 of my friends, ESFP, INTP and I think the third one if an ENTJ. I have two friends who are ESTJs, I like them and they're good friends however at times I don't understand them and their logic annoys me a bit. 
3	I get a long with ESFP too, my best friend is an ISTJ and some INFJ. Butt heads a lot with INTJ.
2	I really get along with INTP’s. All my closest relationships are with them. My sister, my best friend and my boyfriend are INTP’s. Then after that generally I get along with INFPs I find their mediator qualities make me feel at ease. 
12	You	are beautiful, don't forget that.
5	What a nice thing to say! \n\nI wonder what inspires people like yourself to be so randomly kind? I’m genuinely curious because this kind of thing literally never crosses my mind? I’m wondering how it works? \n\nLol, curious ENTJ moment. 😅
2	Back atcha 🖤
2	ay wow thank you 
6	This shit is so useless imo
2	Shut up \n
3	ISFP friend that never texts me first?	I have an ISFP friend that never texts me first, but always responds to my messages and agrees to hang out with me. We've gone to the movies together, been ice skating, gone out for bubble tea, and so on. He seems to enjoy my company, but I feel as if the friendship is often a bit one-sided, considering I'm *always* the one texting him and recommending what we do. As an INFP, I can understand a lack of interest in texting, but if I consider someone a friend, I will always try to keep in touch with them and text them every so often, which includes asking them to hang out with me or just sending them a song or an article I like. I understand the need for space and always try to gauge the comfort levels of my friends. However, it's nice to have someone acknowledge you first sometimes, even though I try not to always expect it. Even if it was once or twice a month I would be happy. He is also originally a friend of my sister, so that makes me question if he sees hanging out with me as an obligation, which would explain why he always waits for me to text him. What do you guys think? Is this a normal ISFP habit or does it say something more?
13	Sometimes texting means a conversation or even just communication I'm not in the headspace for.  It's still time and energy, even when I like someone a lot.  Also, people, however important to me, are never at the forefront of my mind unless something's really got my heartstrings.  To that end, I'm aware of my shortcomings as a friend, I'm probably not going to change, and I'm very grateful for the people who make the effort to keep me in their lives.
7	Why don’t you just ask him next time you meet?
5	honestly most times I forget about texting and leave people on read unconsciously because I truly forget I don’t think texting first can determine how much a person likes you honestly as long as we’re willing to spend time with you it means isfps would like you. at least from my personal experience if I decline meeting up that’s a sign I don’t really care about the person but everyone is different so just ask your friend next time! good luck
4	this is definitely something that I do and it also drove my INFP friend kinda nuts until we talked about it and I explained why I’m so bad at texting in general (forgetfulness, distractions, etc) \n\nSo yeah, talk to your friend. Don’t be confrontational or accusatory about it, but don’t let it slide under the rug if it really bothers you
2	I do this but only because I’m very shy and afraid of interrupting people 🤷🏻‍♀️
2	Honestly I just fucking hate phones in general. I only have the blasted thing so I can make the two phone calls a month I want to make. I always respond because I don't want people to think I hate them. I wish they would just fucking call me though. I realize texting takes a minute, but it feels like such a laborious task to me. You can never adequately convey emotion through text.
1	Honestly I’m not a big texter. That simple. My friends know that and are okay with it. But if a friend did have an issue with that I wouldn’t mind if they talked to me about. Just reach out to your friend :D

1	Ever been really comfortable with someone and accidentally say something that you don't mean?	When I get comfortable with people things tend to slip out of my mouth. This has happened with "lovers" lol, and it always tends to happen when we're talking. \n\nDoes this happen to anyone else? I'm usually pretty cautious when speaking to people until I let my guard down, and then realize what I have done a bit late sometimes.

2	I was 21, but that's just because of stupid religious manipulations.  ugh.

10	Anybody else lose all their friends?	Thinking to myself right now about all my past friendships. I don't know what happened. Maybe I never texted them back. Pretty sure that is the reason. I regret it all. 
19	Dude you need to talk to somebody fr. Your posts indicate you’re spiraling. I recognize it because I identify with you, and if you’re having the same kinds of dangerous thoughts I do, then you need to get help like yesterday.
9	I can only have 3 or for 4 friends at once. If I get close to someone, then I lose someone else. \n\nYou have friends on here. Know you’re not alone! 
5	I’ve been there, when you feel like that, just message one of them hello, I find it so incredibly awkward when I go through this, but it works and I find it’s not as bad as I feel at the time. 
4	Yes, all of them. Someone said you're spiralling, well me too
2	I personally have also lost many of my friends but I don’t regret it much at all. They weren’t real friends. I considered them with high regard and was not. \n\nLucky I have a few friends that are empathic, good people. \n\nI know things might be tough for you right now, but if you remember someone that cared for you, it doesn’t hurt to reach out. The best thing you can do it be brave and contact someone. Catch up with coffee or other beverage and you’ll likely find that it isn’t turning out as poorly as you thought and it’s much more fun than you thought. And that you missed them more than you thought. The feeling would probably be mutual.\n\nGood luck, OP. We will always be here to lend our ears and eyes. 
2	yeah. the people i wish i were still friends with haven't been in my life for like six months ish now, and i don't try to maintain a relationship with any of the friends i do see. but i don't have any regrets, it's my own fault that i didn't try and save our friendship and it was a choice i made, same with not connecting with the people who are actually in my life nearly as much as i should. during this time i've learned a lot and i'm starting to stop shutting everyone out. i don't believe in fate but i like the phrase everything happens for a reason, cause that's just how the universe works. life moves forward and you're in control over where you go. you've been given the opportunity for self reflection and making new friends, it won't happen overnight, but being depressed won't solve anything. go out and do stuff whenever you have the opportunity, and make online friends (discord chats, online video games, etc.)
2	yeah, im in the process of losing all my friends. Figuring out that you're being lied to about how much your closest friends like you is one of the most heart-breaking feelings in the world. Only really have 1 friend that I consider close now :/

3	Things you can't stand about ISFPs	
10	I hate how easy I'm triggered, my low confidence and how much I procrastinate.
6	Definitely procrastination. I need to get more stuff done \n\nalso I don't like how reserved I am, I don't know if that's really an ISFP thing but I'm not very outgoing. I don't really have an issue with it, but it makes making friends/dating a lot harder than it should be 
11	Things you like most about ISFPs	
9	I like how artistic they are, they're also so resourceful and intelligent with a really good gage on how to have fun and be organised 
7	I like how unique they are. I can’t put them in a box, I can’t stereotype them at all. They also have an independent streak that I’m quite fond of. \n\nTheir creativity is also lovely but again it’s because it’s so unique. It’s not the stereotype of what creativity is. 
6	I work with a couple and all three of us just non intrusively get our shit done, don't flip out about a little extra break time, and look hella stylish.  \n\nI'm in a sort of unofficial leadership role (not because I want to be, just sort of thrown in there because efficiency) so my shadow entj comes out a little too often, but the other two are cool and quiet, friendly but unobtrusive, and never take me the wrong way and get butthurt about my stress induced entj-ness.  We all get each other.  It's great.

5	What's your opinion on our shadow functions? (Fe, Si, Ne, Ti)	Can be your experience with them, opinion on the users, etc.\n\n----\n\n**Fe**: Overall, when used in a positive way I like it and I always do my best to go along with it and avoid conflicts, but I tend to find it a really annoying function sometimes, as well (mostly lower Fe, though), like when someone blames themselves for everything, hates themselves and the things they like, and feel everyone else is superior to them. I just can't understand that mindset, that you think the things you believe in are worthless and your only sense of self-worth is how good you are to others. Or when group values are treated like the holy texts and personal values are shunned and treated like sins. Just no, please. Very hit or miss, basically. But overall I don't clash with it often.\n\n **Si**: I actually know very little about this function, probably the function I know least about. Overall I just go "meh" when I see it pop up. The only thing I dislike for sure about Si is the fact that they can be very conservative.\n\n**Ne**: Together with Ti, probably my least favorite functions. I find that the users often have this indirect "holier than thou" vibe, they always feel the need to be all quirky and deep and tend to be rather patronizing towards people with bad Ne, dismissing them as shallow, because oh no, you don't consider the 10 billion other methods you can put mustard on your toast. It's a bit in the same ballpark as Fe when used negatively, imo, it justs seems rather fake and tryhard to me most of the time. I do like a few things about Ne users, though, first off I enjoy the fact that they can deal with whatever you want to talk to them about (Si and Se users tend to ignore me when I ramble on about games or Dragon Ball, for example), they're also very open to people that don't find the mold (I'm autistic and I think pretty much everyone who judged or bullied me for that was ESTP, and while I don't get along with ENTPs at all, they at least didn't attack me for *that* aspect).\n\n**Ti**: The "I understand how it works, but I can't fathom actually being like that" function. In a way, it's the most simple function in the sense that it's easy to understand how it works, but it's the hardest function to understand why someone would actually want to use it. Obviously, as Fi doms we are very driven and place a ton of importance on our opinions, feelings and impressions, whereas Ti is painfully clinical and apathetic. It's kinda like the system inside a game which decides whether you're game over or not, the game doesn't care at all, it just decides based on what's logical or not. Overall I'm okay with it, but I do sometimes find that people who use Ti can get a bit scary, especially when INTPs or IxFJs use it, it's kinda like their face displays how dead inside they are or something. Maybe I'm looking into it too much. What I find weirdest is how they can be so apathetic and not let their emotions influence them even in the slightest. Like I understand that you don't want to act on them, but like.. how can you not even be aware of them? Mystifies me.
3	Great post, thank you. I resonate a lot with what you said, especially about the Ne and Ti functions. For me it's like this:\n\n*Fe:* A hit or miss function with me really. I appreciate it at times and I strive to cultivate more of it myself but other times it can piss me off. For example, when all they seek is positive affirmation from others and never really accept anything negative. It also can be quite circlejerky (if Fi = self pride, then Fe = group pride). I also don't like how much emphasis there is in being other-oriented, I personally think people would be happier and there would be much less drama if people would be a bit more self oriented (not selfish). Being focused on others is not always a positive thing, people can focus on others and "be selfless" in a really bad way. For example, in a game there's a person who only focuses on sabotaging other's efforts instead of focusing on their own. That's a bad way of being other-centered. That's also one of the ways bad Fe can seem bully-like, they prey on the vulnerable and laugh at their pain to boost their own ego for being so emotionally unaffected. \n\n*Si:* A function I don't really understand. Just what it is, physical comfort, memorizing, traditions, the past, existing structures? I guess the best way for me to understand it is doing mundane tasks and being comfortable with it. I mean, Ne hates that stuff right? They want everything to be unconventional. I guess I kind of see Si as a conservative function. \n\n*Ne:* I've had so many Ne users in my life that I'm basically surrounded by them. I have an ISTJ mom, ENFP brother, a couple of INxP siblings, my friend group consists of three talkative Ne users and a couple of Ni-Se people. I've also had several INFP friends. I'd say, out of all people I've come in contact with, the Ni-Se users understood me the most. But I think that should be obvious. I don't exactly hate Ne, except when, like you said, they have that "holier-than-thou" attitude. I also can find it exhausting to be around Ne people for long periods of time, I can't handle having long drawn out conversations, I need physical stimulus every now and then. (This doesn't mean that I can't be in an isolation tank, I think I'd actually do quite well inside of it, it's just that my primary focus of extroversion is on the physical rather than ideological. \n\n*Ti:* Another function that I either appreciate or find highly annoying. I dislike Ti when it's unhealthy. An example of an unhealthy Ti person would be one guy that's in our school and goes to the same class as my two INxP friends. He's a very quiet and withdrawn guy, but holds a lot of questionable beliefs, thinks he's far more intellectually superior and right than everyone else, bases his relationships with people on his own logical perception of the world and holds the perception as the "ultimate truth" to everything, and even mocks other people's way of behaving in friendships because he thinks his way is much better. Oh and then he acts victim when his own beliefs and methods of what friendships should be like are rejected. Overall a disgusting guy. \n\nTo me Ti to Fi is kind of like Si is to Ni. In general I might find Ti quite boring, but I can see how it's necessary. But also I can loathe the intellectual circlejerk surrounding it (resulting from low Fe probably) and the quiet arrogance behind it. To me superiority complexes and arrogance are just the worst when people refuse to confront their arrogant beliefs and just hold it inside their heads. \nThankfully my female INTP friend isn't like that though. I adore her.
3	Fe-- I really can't stand it.  It's exhausting and at times, disingenuous, used to keep peace and to keep awkwardness at bay when someone who hasn't earned the right to my real opinion tries to engage me.  So I guess in that regard, it's a pretty useful shield, but I certainly don't like using it.\n\nSi-- It'll just come up out of nowhere and I'll start feeling crappy about some past thing I've long since dealt with and I know it's not me and it's completely irrational so I just need to wait it out.  It doesn't usually take too long to pass, as long as I don't give it an opportunity to become my present again.  Sometimes manifests in odd ways, like not liking the new Nintendo controller because it doesn't feel like the old one did.  Small, seemingly random details will jump out at me, and I'll remember weird bits of old conversations (but if I bring it up, no one ever believes me because people also think I don't listen).  It's an interesting one, Si.  My relative lack of it means when someone asks what I've been up to, I draw a complete blank and look like a boring idiot. lol.\n\nNe-- This one often feels more natural to me than Se, like in conjunction with tert. Ni, you can't go deep without also going wide, and I often feel more in the clouds than fully present.  It's still pretty immature though, and presents pretty wonkily, filtered through Fi and all that.  It's like the world is filled with all these wonderful, unanswerable questions and the possibilities are endless and that's part of the beauty of it-- like did we discover math, or did we create it as a means to try and understand?  All I know is that everything is connected and the questions and theories surrounding how make it all the more fascinating.\n\nTi-- I feel like I use this quite a bit even though it never shows up on those tests.  It's kind of like this-- in order for a feeling to pass muster, it needs to reconcile logically (and logically does not mean empirically).  If I can't make sense of the feeling, I examine it until I can or I throw it out.\n\nCool question, btw :)
2	ENFP here - as an Ne dom, the way you describe Ne is how it shows itself in many people, but it's not actually what Ne feels like. Ne is simply the ability to associate. So when you say something, it will instantly remind me of something else. Our mind is like a connected web of ideas. But instead of ideas going deeper and deeper (Ni), it extends outwards. It's like one of those word webs you see online. Someone on reddit described it as a prospector looking for gold over wide swaths of areas, while Ni (which is in your stack) is about digging deep in one area to look for the gold. Ne is like Se in that it's exploratory, but it's more ideas based than sensation based. I feel like it's the learning function - when I'm trying to learn something new I can do it pretty fast by reading as much as I can really quickly. I have a very good initial intuition about how something works because I can absorb other peoples' mindsets, but when pressed, I can't explain it very well or do it very well compared to experts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think Si (the last function in my primary stack) is very similar to Se in that we pay a lot of attention to details, feelings and sensations in the moment, but we don't normally use it to decide what we are going to do now. Instead, we store it for the future and when I'm trying to learn something new or create a new theory with my brother (ISFP), I try to apply the elements of that theory to experiences that I've had in the past to see if it matches. Sometimes I'll lie in bed and very very vivid memories will float up for me - it's very relaxing. I feel like Se is all about using sensory information to drive current actions/decisions - correct me if I'm wrong. (I'm actually not too clear on the difference between Si and Se and would love to learn more.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps! 
2	So I'm an entj and subscribed to this sub because I wanted to understand the opposite of my functions. I am still learning about mbti so don't know much about it yet but had an idea that isfp is my shadow which sometimes I will become? (But an unhealthy version)I find if I get in a bad place that I become introverted in the sense of feeling shy and in my head and withdrawn, I generally loose my intuition and don't know how to understand things, my feelings become very overwhelming and I loose my judgment and can't make any decisions. I think my type is seen as unemotional, but often I am trying to protect my feelings when I lead with thinking over feelings on decisions.
1	I like your presentation on Ti. Because it totally makes sense that you would think that about it. Like, if I was an isfp I would maybe see it similarly. I would be wondering why is this person so clinical when they could be feeling more. Good post. -INFJ 6w5 
26	Anyone else not really ever regret anything?	Sometimes I can have trouble moving on from things but I don't ever regret anything; I just don't see the point. I guess I take everything as a positive learning experience. I'd only feel regret if I did something terrible, which I haven't done.
16	I regret opening up to and trusting certain people, but that’s mainly because I knew not to proceed with them in the first place but I ignored my own intuition and ended up feeling stupid.\n\nI think ISFP intuition is underrated. Mine is always on point, yet I rarely trust it and I don’t know why.\n\nI guess because the heart wants what it wants, regardless of whether it’s a good idea or not.
5	I can definitely relate to this. I just chalk things up to it happens for a reason or there was a lesson to be learned from it.
4	I relate. I don’t regret anything, really. It’s almost like I do not feel the feeling of regret. That is one thing I dislike about myself because there are plenty of things I’ve done in the past that I should regret doing but I simply do not. 
2	I don't regret doing things, as you say I see them as a learning experience. However I do regret not doing things
2	I regret a lot of stuff honestly, but who knows how my life would be had I gone another route. I'm happy with the way things are going now but I could have made better decisions earlier. 
1	I completely agree. Of course, I feel embarrassment  sometimes, but I don’t *regret*. My mistakes have shaped me into who I currently am, and my life would be entirely different if I never did anything stupid. 
6	Advice you would give to people suffering from Anxiety	
10	I worked with a counsellor for over a year for my anxiety which would leave me homebound all the time, constantly overthinking and stressing about the what-ifs and worst case scenarios And these thoughts often prevented me from getting a job and keeping it, maintaining contact with friends, etc. . I found what helped me tremendously was her suggestion to make “space” between myself and my thoughts by making a habit of just DOING something when I find myself heavily in my thoughts and anxious. I think this is related to being ISFP. We are naturally doers and being in our heads as opposed to being in touch and engaged with physical surroundings is not our natural mode (at least I have found this to be the case with myself). So whenever I find myself becoming sucked in to anxiety or overthinking, I find any activity that is convenient and that will get me engaged and out of my thoughts. For example, sometimes when I know I have to go to work when I’m feeling off or go do something I don’t particularly enjoy I become anxious and overthink all of the ways that it will be the worst time. Instead of sitting and overthinking about it and letting it leave me immobile, I get up, listen to music and take my time getting myself ready and try to focus on the present moment rather than what my anxious thoughts are trying to draw my attention to. I find it is best to nip it in the butt as soon as possible and to just go and do anything right when you notice it, to prevent you from getting sucked into an overthinking cycle. Sometimes I’ll just go for a drive and listen to music, or go to a store and browse, find a show to lose myself in or do things around the house. \n\nI hope this helps! 
2	Career advice	Hello guys, \n\nIt is my first post and writing mistakes may be made since English is not my native language ( sorry about that) \n\nI'm 24 years old , and I've discovered my type one year ago and since then I've been confused. I have a personal history regarding changing degree that I'm not proud of , I've been changing my decision about careers about 4 times already. I went from agriculture, sociology , psychology , marketing , business and now i'm studying management in college. I also work part time at a company who produces and sells aquariums and I have a good professional relationship with my boss. He says he wants me to be the future manager there when I will finish my business degree.\n\nI am not sure if that is what I want to do , I've completed  rigurous aptitude tests, and the results where that I have very good visual spatial skills and very good analitycal thinking, and that I might be good at engineering. In school I've always liked science, and I have been passionate about aquariums. Now I don't have any passion, I am super confused , I feel stuck , I have no motivation to continue , because I feel that maybe I am missing something better. Also , I've read that ISFP's have trouble finishing their studies , and I am worried that with my indecision I might remain without any type of higher education and then I will regret it. Lately I had obsesive thoughts about this problem.\n\nAny advice ? How do you guys made a decision about your career path ? \n\n&#x200B;
4	Best advice I would have given my past self is to try as many different kind of jobs first and figure out what you hate and like about it. But since you already have done this. Make a personal list things about a job you like or dont-like? For example:\n\n\n\nJob history: engineering (really didnt like the stress and planning) -> bluecolor job (liked the hands on stuff but it got monotonous very quick) -> programming (love you can always learn new things and the work environment is chill)  
1	I took the things that I liked. Biology and helping people and got a career that suited those. It was not easy though. I failed two years and ended up taking longer than expected to finish. But I must say I am glad my parents pushed me to see it through. There were times I didnt want to carry on. Now I am qualified and my work only gets better. Yes I have bad days, weeks. But the ultimate goal/feeling is the same. \n\nI would advise you to try and push to finish. Ive seen so many people start and stop studies to many times, and after a while they dont have anything. 
3	Past, Present, Future	Order them from 1-3.\n1 being you think of them the most and 3 being you think of them the least.\nFor me it would be:\n1.Present\n2.Future\n3.Past
5	I’d probably have a tie for present and future, and past as last, as well. Idk, I think about the future A LOT more than seems stereotypical for ISFPS, however, it’s usually like within the next 5 or so years at most. I don’t think I’ve ever just sat there and thought about what I’d be like at 80, or even 30 for that matter. I’ll be 18 in a couple months, so I think about college a lot, and I kind of want to get married young-ish. Other than that, I’m mostly focused on what’s going on right now.
5	1. Present 2. Future 3. Past 
5	Really bad mood: Present, dips of past, no future\n\nReally good mood: Present, hopeful future, forgot about past completely\n\nNeutral: Present, future, past
1	Present, future and past. I even forget a lot of things I did when I was a kid.
1	I'd say present, future, past but I think about the future a lot. It might be tied with or even higher than present. I'm both anxious and ambitious, which makes me think about it a lot
1	Present, future, past.  Sometimes I'll get really anxious about the future, usually after waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back to sleep, and sometimes I'll get really triggered about something in the past but for the most part, I'm right here, right now.
1	Saame. 1. Present, 2. Future, and 3. Past. 
6	Do you use Instagram?	If so, what for? And what does your page consist of? 🤔
14	I do have an acc but I found that I only wasted my time checking the explore page and felt nervous every time I uploaded a pic so I uninstalled the app
9	I don't 
5	no
5	Yes, I have a little art account.
3	Yeah.\n\nI post mostly either photos of myself or I post videos of myself doing flips and fight scenes I create.
3	I use it for following people in my hobbies: powerlifting, impractical jokers.\n\nI post lifting videos of myself
3	Ugh, Instagram. I have a love/hate relationship with that app. I’ll use it heavily for awhile and then delete my accounts and not use it for months at a time and then start over again. Rinse and repeat. \n\nI mostly use it for discussing politics and religion but I also have a love for art and music (must be my subconscious ISFP showing, haha) so I follow pages oriented towards that too. 
2	I use it to connect with others about my hobby and I sometimes post photos that I think are interesting. I don't intend to have a huge following, it is mostly to amuse myself. \n
2	I have one that I only use for messaging
2	I have an account, but it goes unused. I posted a few pictures of my progress at the Rhythm Heaven games a while ago, but that was about it.
2	I have an account! I usually post pretty pictures from my little adventures, or just pics of me/pics with my friends.
2	I made an account years ago, because I knew someone who had one. Never touched it again.
1	Yes, originally to follow artists there and for it to be an art account but now I do follow people I know and I follow makeup stuff. 
1	Yes, mine has a lot of cat pictures, a few mirror selfies, and other miscellaneous stuff. I follow a lot of fitness, fashion and gun accounts
2	Would you rather stay home all day or work at a job that you hate for 8 hours?	
6	I'd rather stay home as long as I can keep in contact with people. 
5	I already stay home all day when im not at work so definitely the staying home one lol
5	If I absolutely hate my job I'd 100% stay home all day, and maybe even if I didn't hate my job.  It's all just a means to an end and the end is the time that is mine, the time in which I get to choose with what to fill it.  Gaah, what an awkward sentence lol
4	stay home obviously if I hate the job, but honestly that gets boring really quickly, so I don't mind working. I also need to make money, so I'm happy to work even if my job isn't great. \n\nI don't love my current job but I basically just patrol an area at night/early morning, so other than going to bed at 7AM it's pretty nice. 
3	Stay at home for sure
10	Any of you fellow ISFP's sell on etsy?	I know it's a stereotype that were artistic so don't assume I'm saying you all are but I know some of you are. I just opened my shop on etsy and I virtually know nothing about it. Do any of you have any tips to get sales or is there another outlet you use to sell your art? If you want to check out my page here's my link : https://www.etsy.com/shop/PassionAbovePower?ref=search_shop_redirect
3	I use RedBubble to sell my photos. I’ve tried different sites, but I have by far the most luck on there.
2	No advice but your art looks great!\n\nI've sold to a couple friends and given to family... Still pretty reticent to do anything but display to the general public, lol. 
1	Do you think this would work with 3D models?
1	Not Etsy, but I do print on demand stuff like Amazon, Redbubble, and Teepublic.
1	oh cool! i would suggest tagging your items with buzzwords, and also having multiple listings going at once :) i love the detail on the bird, btw. good luck out there!  \nalso... i do some knitting and sell a couple knitted items on my etsy, along with some vtg clothes... [https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/spectralspectrum](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/spectralspectrum)
1	I do, vinyl decals and SVG designs for cutting machines 
9	The Power of Fi	As positive as Fi has been to me intrapersonally, lately I feel like it's an overwhelming force and I wish I could turn it off for a while, see things more objectively, not have to filter everything I hear and read through "how does this relate to me/how can I relate to this".  It gets exhausting and exasperating and I think it's a large part of why I don't say much in real life unless I've really thought it through to a point beyond Fi.  \n\nNot really looking for advice, just thoughts. 🙏
6	Yeah, I wish I could just shut my brain off and just get things done faster
2	Thankfully my ESTJ mom takes care of that haha
2	Are you outgoing?	
16	Definitely super outgoing with people I’m comfortable with. I can be. Plus my anxiety makes me seem really outgoing as I talk really fast and have high energy when I’m anxious. But I always have to recharge and need a lot of alone time. 
7	Not really, no.
6	I don't mind being seen but the less I'm heard, it seems, the better.  
3	hell buckin dah
2	No
2	I'd say I am
2	I’m completely mixed, at work everyone knows me, I’m chatty, I’m out there, it’s great! outside of work I can feel like I don’t exist, it’s very weird. 
2	bitch, i can be
1	No, but when I'm out there I love it especially when I'm alone or with people I like.
5	ISFP males and dating	Are ISFP males more suited to date women who are thinking types?\n\n
9	According to 'statistics', we're the ISFP males are the sexiest male type. However that don't mean much if like myself you don't have much confidence to speak to girls. 
4	My best relationship was with an ENFP. I think MBTI means jackshit when it comes to relationship compatibility though.
11	What do you dislike?	
30	overly clingy people 
27	People telling me how to live my life 
15	Confrontation, being told what to do, overly touchy people, judgemental people, hypocritical people, bad breath ....I think my list would be shorter if you asked me what I do like lol. 
11	Know-it-alls that doesn't know it all.
19	violence, covert narcissism/arrogance, self-righteousness 
9	aggressive extroversion, infringement on individual rights, pop music
7	Being told what to do by people who know less than me
12	That's a lot to list, I'll keep it short:\n\n* Aggressive douchebags (like the ESTP stereotype, I've encountered some irl) \n\n* In general people who I clash with based on interests and views. People who hate anime and games generally aren't exactly my friends.\n\n* Ugliness in general. \n\n* Being trapped by things like projects, exams, etc. Too much stress. \n\n* Socially awkward situations. \n\n* Spiders.\n\n* People who are too selfless and people who are too selfish. The former is rather unrelatable and very annoying, while the latter tends to be kinda psychopathic.
5	Mental fog/vertigo\n
5	Being ignored or shut out by people who i care about
2	mean people, rude people, bullies, people who don't value feelings, confrontation, and the way society works (I'm an ISFP in a world run by ENTJs).
1	Loud, opinionated, self righteous cunts who expect you to be interested in their values and opinions.
10	What do you love?	
10	Writing music, hiking deep in the wilderness, reading quietly by a window,  meeting someone I connect with deeply (rare),  discovering new artists or people of interest that I can go down the rabbit hole on
18	my ex ayyyyy
5	/r/collage  \n  \n^(^^hook ^^it ^^to ^^my ^^veins)
4	Music in general, going to rock concerts, getting really invested in an RPG's main story line, drinking a couple of beers with some good people whilst having deep conversations, watching the sunset on a snowy day
2	music, oil pastels, thinky deep thoughts
1	Music
1	Music, stories, competitive video games, laughing at something till i cry, making things (lego, knex, programming), and people i care about
8	Do you feel/act your age?	
7	Depends, I feel like I'm more mature than people my age, however when I'm with friends I can get a bit silly at times 
4	People think I'm about ten years younger than I am but I feel ooold
3	Not really, I'm 19 and I don't drink, do drugs, have a job, smoke or go to parties. Besides that I'm not really interested in love so I don't have a gf either. It's pretty relaxing.
2	I feel way too old on the inside
1	I feel old and I have lower backaches but when my age is asked I always still have the urge to say '18'. I'm 20.
3	Advice on personal growth?	Tips for being more confident around people (especially new people), accomplish goals, improve your skills or any other advice which has helped you improve as an ISFP person. 
5	Definitely learn to get out of your comfort zone!  Even if it’s just by a fraction each time, you’re building a foundation, and when you look back over time, you’ll see great improvement.  \n\nI work in a very “Type A” personality job, and as an ISFP, I don’t consider myself a type A or B person. It’s been a challenge dealing with the anxiety that can come from new situations, but as I’ve challenged myself, and also often not having a choice with my job but to deal with things I don’t want to, I’ve grown immensely.
2	Taking up uber driving has been amazing for my social skills. I've learned how to chat to all different kinds of people. It's also helped me get to know my city and is really fun cruising around all day. Every day is an adventure to somewhere new. So I guess my advice is choose a job/hobby which is going to challenge you while suiting your needs as an isfp.
2	Find something your passionate about and force yourself to do the thing with other people. Always worked for me. 
5	What is your reasoning for using Reddit?	Honestly, I only use it for this sub.
10	I love studying people and hearing different perspectives and personal stories. 
5	There are a few subs I like on here, but honestly almost all of them have some annoying stuff so I'm trying to dial down my usage. I like some fashion and music subs, but I spend too much time reading stuff on /r/askmen or r/askreddit. This sub also isn't bad, I check it every so often.\n\nI guess I'm just bored, but I should be using that time for something else because browsing reddit is sort of depressing in a way. 
3	I was initially looking for memes but then I found these mbti boards.  Will stay till I get bored.
3	Mostly subs like r/painting or r/art just for some inspiration but I also like this sub and r/MBTI as well 
3	Not an ISFP, I’m a curious ENTJ that enjoys reading this subreddit to gain insight because you folk are my opposite after all. I initially started using reddit for psychology and mental health issues subreddits because I dated a narcissist and wound up in a seriously toxic web of a “friendship” with a sociopath/narcissist couple, and I have a mental illness; so I was originally trying to get insight into all of that... and then I found the mbti subreddits and I was like, “Aha, I found my people!” Lol. 
1	makeup and memes. 
6	Which animal reminds you of yourself?	I identify with cats because I love to sleep, cuddle and receive petting.
6	Cats. Rabbits and foxes, too. \n\nWe had a thing in one of our psychology classes where we had to write down an animal that came first into our minds, then second and third. The first animal was your "ideal self". The second one was how others see you. The third was how you actually are. \n\nSo, my first animal was a cat (my ideal self), my second was a fox (how others see me) and the third was a rabbit (who i actually am). It was a fun test thingy, although I also thought it was kinda accurate haha
4	Dog because I'm cuddly and excitable.
6	cat, fox, crow (I like the three animal theory up there).
4	(ENFP) I think most ISFPs identify with cats, interestingly enough. I don't think I think of myself in animal terms at all although a friend of mine called me a jaguar once because in social settings, I often just sit and observe...
2	Not gonna lie, I sort of identify with some insects. Butterflies maybe. Or I just love watching them. I have a butterfly tattoo that I love
25	Anybody else really slow at doing things?	I can try to take a quick shower, but it is always a minimum of 10 minutes. I think it has to do with my perfectionist tendencies. Also when I used to work as a grocery bagger my manager would tell me to work faster. LEMME ENJOY MY TIME!!! ;'(
16	Yesssss. Lol. I've learned that I have to give myself an hour to get ready in the morning and a lot of the time I'm late regardless lol. I just like to make every step of the process be enjoyable. Like I'll sit and search for a YouTube video to have on while I get ready. And I make my coffee. I just don't like rushing things!
8	10 minutes is a long shower? Bruhhhh...
8	Yes people always tell me to do things faster, I just like working at my own pace 
5	Yes, I'd love a job as a graphic artist. I'd just hate the deadlines and that anxiety...
5	It’s hilarious how much I resonate to everything here. 
4	I’m 5 minutes late everywhere I go! I just really like making sure I’m doing everything perfect! I’m a slow worker, but I feel like I make less mistakes and typos that the faster workers. If you’re more efficient then it’s worth it to me!
5	Yeah, I just really value taking my time and relaxing whenever I get the chance
3	I’m five minutes late everywhere I go! I’m definitely a slower worker, but I feel like I typically make less mistakes than some of the faster workers. I think efficiency is better, and more enjoyable once you reach the end! 
3	I'm generally slower paced at everything in life. My bf pointed it out recently lol
3	Definitely relate to the last point, I was hopeless in fast food. My KFC manager only gave me shifts to clean the foyer because I was so good at cleaning, and so slow at everything else.
1	YES and it doesn't even matter if I make a point to speed it up.  It's like I operate entirely on my own clock and none of the js in my life get that.  They're always "just be on time, it's not that difficult," or advising me to do little things to speed up my process, and it's like, No.  It doesn't work that way.  If it wasn't difficult to be consistently on time, I would've figured it out by now.  \n\nThe thing is, I work and complete tasks very quickly, which has earned me good reputations at every job I've ever had, and in my art, I've had to actively teach myself to slow down.  So it seems to be indicative of what I'm trying to do and whether or not I really want what's at the end, i.e. a finished task or art piece (I can be really impatient when it comes to myself).  Furthermore, being beholden to a set schedule is the worst and I can fake my way from the brink of suspension but can never make a solid routine rote. 
36	How I feel being ISFP effects me	Just wanted to explain how I think being as ISFP effects me and my personality. Maybe some can relate.\n\nI come across shy and quiet to people, but really I just don't like opening up to people I'm not close to. I find it hard to think of what to say, and I sometimes feel too exhausted to even try having a conversation and just accept being quiet. However, if I have the energy and am in a 1 on 1 conversation, I can act very charismatic and extroverted, primarily with cute girls though, not gonna lie.\n\nI'm often observant and always taking in my surroundings. My friends will sometimes wonder why I turn around and look around the room like I'm paranoid sometimes. I just like knowing what's around me, and I get anxious if I don't, like in the dark, or swimming in deep water. Along the lines of being observant, I feel like I'm good at reading people and understanding they're motives.\n\nWhen researching ISFPs, I found that we are often very in tune with our five senses. Which I've always had a problem with sensory overload since I was little. Textures, sounds, and smells have always been very loud and can overwhelm me sometimes. Not sure if these are connected.\n\nPeople are often scared by change, I'm the opposite. I can't stand things being monotonous, especially my job. I feel like I need to be doing something different, or an new adventure everyday. I don't like living in the same place for very long, I'd love to just live in a van and sleep in a different town everynight.\n\nI don't plan things out very well. I hate things being scheduled and having to plan what I'm going to do. This makes me feel trapped and colostrophobic. I often do things in the moment, with very little planning.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed, people are generally either a leader personality or a follower. I feel like I'm neither. I can't stand being told what to do, for the same reason I hate plans and schecules. But I also don't like taking the lead. I prefer doing things on my own.\n\nDon't really know what I was getting at with all this. I've just been trying to be self aware for the past few months and have learned a lot about myself and why I do things.
23	To me, it means a strong sense of self and that's a wonderful thing to walk through life with.  It also means a sometimes overwhelming feeling of not being understood, but it's a pretty fair trade.\n\nIt means my "identity" is in a constant state of flux, that I'm a dynamic, rather than static, character, and that I'm always learning something about not only myself, but this amazing world.\n\nIt means I'm probably not going to fit in anywhere and that rejection will take its toll, and that I'm self defeatingly private.\n\nIt means I can spot a manipulator a mile away but I can't convince a loved one it's happening to them.\n\nIt means sensual experience is elevated to profundity and it means I make and understand connections I cannot articulate.\n\nIt means wonderful relationships with little animals.\n\nIt means words often fail me, but music never does.\n\nIt means I'm not beholden to any particular path except for my own.\n\nIt means that whatever happens, I know I'll be alright.\n\n
9	Thank you for sharing. I love reading these because they are often so astoundingly relatable. As a person who has always felt so unique and misunderstood, it's kinda funny and humbling to discover MBTI and realize there are countless people just like me.
6	I can't believe there are people out there with exactly the same personality as me
5	"I can act very charismatic and extroverted, primarily with cute girls though, not gonna lie." 
2	always had a problem going to a hairdresser where chitchat is a norm - I just don't know how to start a conversation - my biggest struggle so I grew my hair long ;)
6	cuddles or neck kisses?	
7	Both at the same time ofc
6	Prefer cuddles more but neck kisses aren't bad. Just neck kisses can make me feel like I'm suffocating sometimes for some reason. I wish my fiance didn't hate feet so much cause I wanna rub our feet together sometimes.
4	both, i dont mind bein the little spoon every once in a while lol
4	Cuddles. Both are important though :)
4	Neck kisses make me melt into a supple puddle\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo cuddles if we are keeping it PG and friendly :)
3	Both. Cant have one without the other :P 
2	Cuddle neck kiss
2	Do you know any ISFPs in real life besides yourself?	
4	Yea I know quite a few and I get a long quite well with them 
3	No but I know an ESFP
3	I had an ISFP teacher (I think), she seemed like a witch or a magician and honestly reminded me a bit of Minerva McGonagall
2	Lots of them in my arts uni! We act different, but the process of thinking is similar.
2	No :(
2	Yes. Had all of my coworkers take the test. Only one older lady got ISFP. Oddly enough,I got along with her best. I was most comfortable around her and we could be silent around eachother with no awkward tension.
1	Yes. We all like saying sorry a lot too.
2	dogs or cats?	🐶🐱
8	🐈
7	Dogs but I love both 
6	🐕
4	🐈
3	Cats... but dogs can also be cute as fuck
3	Cat.
3	🐱 
3	Both but cats a bit more
2	Dogs but with the responsibility of a cat :D
2	Dogs 🥰
2	Cats only, plz.  Okay, chickens can be there too. 
1	Dating app	Hi fellow ISFPs how's your experience on dating apps? Have you had any success on them?
3	I used Coffee Meets Bagel about a year and a half ago and got a few matches, but I deleted the app after a week. It just seemed like more work than it was worth and I was really busy with school & work. The women I matched with were nice but I didn't really have a clue what to say. \n\nI'd like to get back on it since I have gotten in much better shape since then, but I don't have many recent pictures of myself and my phone's front camera is broken...so I might buy a new phone or I'll just try to meet people IRL. I'm a pretty passive and reserved guy though, so other than going to the gym and work, I don't do much, so a dating app is probably the best idea for me honestly. 
5	How to help a depressed Isfp friend	Hi all, I have a friend who is an Isfp. We dated very briefly but are now just good friends. I feel like hes been in a really bad way ever since he broke up with his ex who he dated before me. Every time I see him, he just looks worse and worse. He used to be one of the most handsome guys I’ve ever met and now he’s just so thin and just not taking care of himself. We hung out recently and he told me that he just feels tired all the time and uncomfortable, like somethings not right. I remember feeling this after being really heartbroken and I had to take medication to feel like myself again. Recently I asked him how he was doing and he said that his new place took some adjusting to which I feel like is code for not doing so well. I really want to ask him what’s wrong and if he wants to talk about it, even his ex whom he has never mentioned, but I’d be fine listening to it if it helps him. I feel like he’s a very private person who doesn’t talk to people about much, which may not be very good for him. How do I word this in a way that he will be receptive to? I really do care about him a lot and want to see him get better. Suggestions?
4	I'm an ISFP and can actually relate too your friend pretty well. ISFPs are generally closed off and hard to get too. We also usually like to try to do things alone. So, it's going to be very hard to get him to open up since he probably wants to work this out by himself.\nHonestly, don't push him to open up. Generally we don't like doing something because someone told or wants us to. Again, we like doing it on our own, so just try to make it very easy for him to open up when he wants to. So in all reality, just be there for him. There's no way you can really completely fix things though, some stuff like this he might just need to take time and work things out for himself.
1	Not sure you will read my comment but  I'm going to comment on your post anyway because i think it is an important post.   I do think it is important that you express your concerns  and ask him if he wants to talk about it.  If he doesn't want to talk about it with you should recommend that he talks about it with a therapist. It is also important that you express your availability and offer to listen to him if he changes his mind.  It can be difficult to deal with a friend who is unwell, so remember to take care of your own health. 
6	Am I ISFP or INTJ? I have tried for years to figure out the answer.	So I have spent a ridiculous amount of time going back and forth between if I am an INTJ or an ISFP. Please help me decide where I fit in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nList of my traits:\n\nPretty sure I am Fi, Te, Se, Ni, but I’m not sure the order..and that’s why I’m not sure if I’m INTJ or ISFP\n\n1. I find it easy to make decisions and stick to them\n2. Tend to have unwavering opinions, I will debate something until I agree 100% with the logic of the other side\n3. Tend to take the position of leader in a group of people\n4. Always daydreaming and zoned out\n5. Tend to be insensitive because I’m super objective\n6. Sarcastic comments all the time\n7. When I’m stressed I get hyper focused on my work and start organizing everything\n8. When I’m super stressed I start spiraling and freaking out over how I am failing\n9. If I am sad and don’t want to be I can reason to myself why I shouldn’t be and kinda turn it off, the majority of the time\n10. Really love art, reading, aesthetics, things like that\n11. Get introspective all the time\n12. Very strong personal values\n13. In an argument, I’m good at responding right away without having to think things through\n14. read a lot of philosophy and love hypothetical questions, logic puzzles and things of the sort. Pretty much constantly filling my free time with activities like that. \n\nThere’s a lot more but those are some of the main parts .. do you have any questions I could think about that might make the solution more telling?
8	You sound very much like an INTJ. I don't know how you thought you might be an ISFP, but you almost certainly aren't.
2	You seem like and ENTJ
2	Only a few of those are ISFP traits. Most...aren't. Some very strongly so. I'm not sure what you are, but I doubt it's ISFP.
1	Definantly not an ISFP...
1	hi
1	Visit this website 16personalities.com
3	What would be your ideal job?	Mine would be a dog walker. Walking dogs in beautiful scenic areas with no cars, sidewalks or roads. Just nature.\n\nOr a dishwasher at a restaurant that only a few people go to. I would listen to music and zone off while washing dishes. \n\nOr a motel receptionist at a motel that only a few people go to. I would play my PSP for the whole shift. And listen to music.\n\n
3	Reading, looking out the window, walking in nature. \n Can I somehow make these my job?
3	Im not sure yet, Ive been thinking maybe graphic design 
3	Anything that requires little human interaction. 
2	I've always thought EMT or bartender sounded like great jobs to me. \nWorking in a small motel sounds super appealing though 
2	I can't stand monotonous work, doing the same thing everyday. So something that always keeps me moving around would be great, maybe a job where I'd primarily be driving.
2	Growth opportunities. Can’t imagine anyone would be fulfilled by a boring job. I HATE being stagnant. 
2	For some reason programming seems to fit me. It never gets boring.
1	An opera singer or literature professor.
1	Being the warden on a massive nature reserve. Except I never have to interact with the public or do anything except wander around taking it all in. Yes I know it doesn't exist but fuck it, that's what I'd love to do.
20	Anyone else feel like they understand people way better than others?	I feel like my fiance is terrrrible at it. I still haven't quite typed her, but I'm thinking esfj.\n\n\nThe other day we were talking about her mom after they got off the phone. She said her mom didn't seem like ahe wanted to do something. I asked why. She said she sounded sad. I asked why she would not want to do it though. She said she just sounded sad. I asked again why would she not like doing thing. \n\n\nAlmost like my fiance didn't think about why her mom wouldn't want to do something and focused only on the fact she didn't want to do it. \n\n\nShe also seems to misunderstand people's intentions. She got mad and thought this guy was being a Dick because he wanted to make sure we didn't miss an appointment this time we went because he's a small business and his money flow depends on appointments.\n\nDo you all seem to understand people and their motivations more than others around you? And do you happen to know what cognitive function these seem like in my fiance?\n\n\n
10	Yeah, I can strongly relate. I feel this way a lot 
5	(ISTJ) I do not look for reasons behind things generally.  If you had asked me those questions, I probably would have answered the same as your fiancée because you’re asking for speculation.  Who am I to decide I understand the whys?  And any answer that I give without verifying the truth with my mother, would be pure conjecture on my part.   And it doesn’t make sense to me to just make up reasons behind actions. Now, I do understand that some types are perfectly capable of reading the signs and trusting their instincts on things like this.  I am not one of them. Ne is my last function, and as such I can’t trust it’s input.  So I don’t. It’s enough for me that I understand that she doesn’t want to do it.  And in general, I don’t really care why people do what they do.  I just care what actually gets done or not. \n\nOn the other hand, your fiancée is definitely not ISTJ if she’s taking things like verifying appointments personally.  I think you’re on the right track (sensor with Fe) in typing her, but I don’t know why you wouldn’t just ask her to take the tests.  Typing others is unreliable, in my opinion. 
3	I'm the same. ISFPs are very perceptive and are generally good at reading people.
2	As an ISFJ with a little social anxiety, I can relate to your fiancée a little. I can be quite sensitive when it comes to my interactions with other people. I hate to be a bother to others if I sense any hesitance at all. And if someone comes on too strong that can really push me away.
2	Yeah I’ve noticed that some people think more about others. It’s a goal of mine to understand why people do things and say things, because then I can know them better. I genuinely think that no one in the world is a bad person—people just end up in bad situations and don’t handle them well. 
2	I definitely feel like this!
2	(ENFP here) Yes, I think my ISFP brother is very good at reading peoples' underlying emotions. He can often tell me what I'm feeling before I can even tell myself. I think I'm better at guessing a person's underlying motivations (thought processes), but he's very sensitive to feelings. Not sure why - maybe a combo of Fi and Se? 
1	Mmm, I'm not sure I'd say I understand people better but I am able to see motive and can always tell when someone is trying to manipulate.  \n\nI do try and look at as much of a situation as I have access to but if I go purely on a hunch I'm almost always incorrect.
1	Isfp here, and I want to know as much as I can about someone! Anyone! I want to know their goals and aspirations. I want to know what pisses them off and I want to know what they live for.  Most importantly, I want to know why!
11	Pros and Cons of being an ISFP?	😸
13	I believe I am an ISFP so here's my personal take on it..\nPros:\n- non judgmental of people so you don't have the hate and judgmental attitude naturally that a lot of people possess.\n- you are able to fully appreciate nature and animals at a very simple and unassuming way.\n- usually artistic\n- independent\n- you try to follow your own path in life so you are a natural trendsetter. I think this quality is also good because sometimes the majority mindset is wrong.\n\nNow to the cons...\n- reallllyyy bad at thinking of the future and planning. This really messes me up financially(I'm really bad at saving money, I'm queen of the "treat yo self!" Mindset lol.)\n-too sensitive. Now this can be seen as good but it's really hindered me in life because I take everything personally whenever I should use people's feedback to work on myself and see something from their perspective.\n- timid\n- really bad at putting my thoughts into words so people can underestimate me or get the wrong impression.\n
3	Life as an isfp is pretty great. People generally like us, we find happiness in the little things, and we can achieve great things if we find something we’re passionate about. We’re generally good at things, and are in touch with our emotions and the emotions of others.\n\nBut, we’re stuck in the paradox of being lonely and wanting to do everything alone. We can have trouble speaking our minds and opening up. We understand others better than most, in my opinion, but that makes everything really complicated. We can’t deal with conflict.\n\nAll in all, though, i wouldn’t trade it for any other type.
3	Anyone else not into (traditional) art at all?	I don't care for paintings at all, and most of them just seem ugly to me.
2	I can appreciate particularly good traditional art, but I much prefer sculptures because I also make things with my hands.\n\nI suppose its partially because I can't draw so I can't tell how much work was put in, I can only tell it looks nice.
2	I prefer Anime, vaporwave and synthwave art. And video game art. And fantasy art. Traditional art is okay.
1	When it comes to looking at art, I agree. For the most part it's boring and I usually only appreciate things with a practical side as well.\nThat being said, I do love the process of creating just about any kind of art. I just don't usually keep it because I don't want all the clutter afterwords
23	Just venting how I feel	So I've recently figured out I'm an ISFP and after reading many descriptions, I'm amazed that they describe me to a tee. Just want to vent to people who may understand me if that's fine.. \n\nMy emotions and thoughts are extremely special to myself and are what I feel really defines me. I can't describe how much my emotions make me who I am.  Because of this I'm often quiet, not because I'm shy like it comes across, but because I only share what I really feel and think with those who I really, really trust and are close to. A while ago, without going into detail, a friend had been able to slowly get closer to me as a person and this person began to become very special to me. I began opening up to this person, which again is very hard for me to do, since my feelings and thoughts are something special to me and I like them to stay with just me. After some time, this person and I became very close, and I was probably the happiest I had ever been. Untill they decided to take what I has opened up and shared with them, and destroy it. They could have been honest with me, but they even lied to me which only made me feel betrayed more. Now I feel like I just won't ever share my thoughts and feelings with anyone, like I never know who I can trust with something so important to myself. So now I've began to almost close myself off entirely from people and friends, not even letting them see a little bit of what's inside me, knowing people will just tear it apart again.\n\nAfter reading more from ISFP's they often are deeply affected by criticism, and I really agree. I feel like another reason I come across closed off to people is I feel like I'll be judged or critisized for what I feel and think. So I just keep my feelings to myself, and my art to myself who will really appreciate and understand.\n\nDon't know if anyone understands me, or even read this. It just felt good to let something out to people who might understand.\n
6	Yeah man it's good to let these feelings out, I only do it to close friends and even then its rare for me to do it so it's nice to let all these feelings out here
3	Yeah I come across to some people as shallow because I don't want them touching that deeper, emotional part of me
2	Sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better soon.
1	I know an ISFP. She seems to be opening up. But I am an INTP, normally I would keep my opinions to my self, but I am opening up as well. So very likely to say something true(Ti) or speculative(Ne) but which also could easily be taken for criticism, which it is not.\n\nAny suggestions? Only one I think I have been using so far is to talk about myself(Si) or my feelings(Fe).  And that seems to keep me out of trouble.
1	Yes, this is quite similar to some of my experiences. One thing I try to do is gain something from other people's perspectives and see their perspectives as interestingly different even if they try to destroy my inner feelings and values. When they do that I distance myself and become more analytical thinking about their perspective.   
11	Don't know if I can go on any longer	My social anxiety is so bad that I have a hard time leaving the house. I can't do things that a normal person finds easy. Aka driving, working and other adult stuff. My anxiety is ruining my life. I turn 21 soon. 
9	I remember being your age and having the struggle of anxiety. I lived several years in utter fear and controlled by anxious feelings. I would drink and the following day everything would be even worse. I tried all sorts of pills and nothing really made me feel like the person I was deep inside. I really wish I knew what I know now back then. It makes me really happy when I can assist someone in their recovery from anxiety. \n\nIts important to know that there are times even still for me that I struggle with anxious feelings and sometimes its overwhelming. But you know what? I've never died, never made a fool out of myself to the point the people that matter to me cared. All the doom and gloom never happened. So let me break it down for you my friend: Its real simple.\n\nIf you hold the hand rail of fear you give it power. If you practice breathing techniques to clam down, you give it power. If you take a pill, consume alcohol to mask, you give it power.  **ANYTHING** YOU DO to avoid it, you give it power. And you know what? we are so good at that. damn good. we are masters of trying to alleviate problems. \n\nhave you ever been in bed as child and became fearful of a shadow in the room? Its not until you cry out in fear and anxiety and beat yourself up inside scared that your parents come in and show you its nothing but a coat on a coat rack. You become strong one night and you have the same sensation but this time you gain some strength to walk up to the shadow or flip on a light and everything subsides. You learned and that problem magically doesn't come back and if it does you know whats up.  \n\nWhat I'm getting at is we've been taught and trained to be fearful, its how we survive from being ate from animals. Fight or flight is a very real thing, I get that. You likely have a super hyper imagination that transitions thoughts after thoughts into the next doom and gloom scenario. it keeps you from living and communicating with friends and being out in public.\n\nI said all that to say this:  Instead of running and cowering in fear or what may come, welcome it. Go pet the barking dog on a chain. as you approach you will notice the dog doesnt know what to do and is now the one in fear. sounds bat shit crazy but I promise you if i knew this when i was 21 i would have lived a less fearful life.\n\nBest of luck friend, i hope you can fully understand this and apply it to your life. If you need any more guidance on the subject msg me
6	Hey - have you thought of going on medication for anxiety? Message me if you want to talk in more detail. I'm not an ISFP (ENFP), but I've dealt with severe anxiety before. I didn't end up going on medication, but I feel like it can be a good option for some people who have very severe cases.
3	You got this be positive 
2	Make up your mind and force youself. You have a body, you can move. You can do this!
2	I was about that age when i got a job as a dishwasher. Didn't need to talk to anyone, just worked and slept for a year. Sort of like an extended third stage of Morita therapy.  \n  \nI met some very cool people there, who appreciated me . . . and put up with me.  \n  \nYou're not in a vacuum. Other people will help you ^^help ^^yourself.  \nAnd it's ok to feel overwhelmed. Just go at your own pace, and do one thing at a time. (e.g. have you sorted out driving lessons?)
2	Hey I turn 21 soon too and can relate. Message me anytime and we can vent to each other about this shitty age lol
2	You're going to be okay!  \n\nI just recently started medication for anxiety that has helped. But for almost a year before that i was going to therapy regularly, working through the things that were causing so much. I've worked through a lot and have more to go, but I am feeling capable of doing it more easily now.
1	I totally understand what this is like. I've been stuck in such a bad place for the last few months. In my free time, it helps me to paint while listening to interesting/thoughtful podcasts. I try not to spend too much time watching tv as I only feel more anxious after. Spend your time creating and it will feel like you're doing something worthwhile. Especially if you're learning at the same time (from the podcasts).
18	Anyone else feel like...	They wanna be the best and prove it however you will never boast about it but you get very happy when someone compliments you but you won't show your happy cause you don't know how to cause you're shy? 
3	It's a painful desease 😔
1	Dude, you are fr00ping cool.\n\n<3 Your post.\n\nTotally posting this on my blog, if royalties aren't insane, which they probably arr.\n\nThank you sooooooo much 8)\n\n==|87-[==|
17	Love you guys but your independence breaks my heart	ENFP here, with an ISFP brother and dated an ISFP before. I love your type - I think that in some ways they compliment me so well. We have a lot of the same values but we see the world so differently so conversation is never boring. I’m also insanely attracted to the Se, which is elusive to me. You can talk theoretically with me, but we also have a lot of fun adventures. But the thing that breaks my heart is how independent you are. At the end of the day, you and your own happiness comes first. I don’t fault you for it at all, but maybe because we don’t always want the same things, I find it sad that you would not often make sacrifices for someone else. For example, the ISFP guy I dated, I just had the impression that what he wanted the most was freedom and the ability to do anything whenever he wanted. One day we’d be so in love, the next he’d want to move to France and not even think of how I would feel. As my brother gets older, I start to see that as well. We used to do everything together and I love him so much. But he recently told me that he wants to explore the world to see which place felt the most like him and to live there. I want to do that as well, but family is also really important to me, so I’d probably sacrifice being in a place where I felt most at all in order to be closer to the people I love. But I know my brother wouldn’t care. He fundamentally sees himself as alone in the world anyway so his happiness is most important to him. When we agree to work on a long term project together I’ve learned to never expect him to follow through because he will always inevitably decide he would rather do something else halfway through without thinking about how much I need to finish the project we started because I need it to make money or something else. I guess what I’m saying is that neither ISFP felt very reliable. \nI consider myself a pretty independent person, but the ISFPs in my life often make me sad. I don’t know if I’m generalizing, especially because I have ISFP friends who are married and happy and probably have to make some compromises. I’m happy to be proven wrong and would love to hear your insights.\n\nEdit: I think a lot of people are misunderstanding me and thinking that I want you guys to change. I don’t - I was just expressing my own sadness and wanting to understand more.
17	ISFP who dated an ENFP here - though I was typed as INTP when I was with him.\n\nI know you mean well. But you’ve got it all wrong. What works for you might not work for us. My ex said the exactly same thing that you did in your post - that I was “missing out on a lot of happiness” by not prioritizing people as much as he did, and it just made me feel .. guilty for not feeling that way (even though I’m *not* that way). So I tried to live that life and I bent over backwards to please him, but I became the unhappiest I’d ever been being surrounded by people I didn’t 100% believe in (even though they were nice or whatever). I guess I have really high standards.\n\nPersonally I think it’s somewhat narrow-minded to expect someone to love and appreciate other people’s company as much as you do, and to insist that that’s where “true happiness” lies, when in reality, only we know what’s best for ourselves. \n\nI’m not bothered by your type “needing” people, as long as you find other people who feel that way and you form your own group that don’t pester ISFPs for affection.\n\nI’m bothered when your type wants and expects *me* to be the same way, and react negatively when I’m *not* (like “I’m so sad for you guys...” What’s up with that?). Don’t you like variety? Isn’t it cool that someone can be so different from you? Watch us from afar, accept what it is, respect our free will, and please go find likeminded ENFP people to bond with.\n\nNot to mention that I think my ENFP ex loved the benefits of having a girlfriend over actually loving *me*. Like, don’t get me wrong, I think he loved me a lot of course - but all the “romantic gestures” he did, like get me roses and necklaces for any special occasion, felt ironic when our relationship was struggling and I just never really felt.. listened to, or REALLY seen - he was too busy in his own big happy romantic fantasy. It was just me doing everything to be enough - he hardly had to compromise for me at all, and that didn’t feel right. \n\nAll my closest friends are “live and let live” people who don’t need others to be happy. But we love each other all the same and would do anything for each other. When we see each other, it’s not because we’re lonely, but because we actually wanna see each other. That’s what makes the bonds I have so genuine, loyal, and special to me. I’m insanely proud of these few friendships I have.\n\nAnyway, I hope I could change your mind about ISFP independence a little bit.
15	Sheesh... probably not what you want to hear but what you described is exactly me. I’ve had conflicts (if you would call them that) like you just described, before in my life with other loved ones. They said the same thing that you did. \n\nI wish I could say the right thing. The truth is, I just don’t get close to people that look to others for a source of their happiness. Of course I want the people I love to be happy but like you said, me and my happiness come first. So everyone seems to be better off when I keep people at an arms distance and just do my own thing on my own terms. It doesn’t mean that I love anybody any less, just that sometimes it’s better to support people from a distance rather than up close. 
8	(ISTJ) I think the issue here is that most of the ISFPs that I’ve met consider happiness personal in and of itself.  You cannot MAKE someone happy, just as you cannot make someone love you.  So to try and change themselves or sacrifice for someone else’s happiness makes no sense.  From what I’ve seen, if and when an ISFP sacrifices something, it is because it’s their own personal belief that it is simply the right thing to do in that situation, whether that’s a relationship or what have you. 
6	I think you’re wanting ISFPs to be something that they fundamentally are not. \n\nPeople are who they are no matter what their personality type. You can’t make them be anything other than who they are. \n\nNeeding people isn’t a crime, but trying to tell ISFPs that they *have* to be a certain way otherwise it’ll break your heart? That’s not going to sit well with them, or anyone really, ISFP or not. \n\nISFPs are independent, why would you see that as a negative thing? That independence is a quality that I appreciate about them. \n\n- an ENTJ 
7	Hi I’m an ISFP female, and I’ve gotta say, I can’t argue what you’ve said, but I can explain why (emotionally) I do what I do. I find that when I’ve been in one spot too long (wether it be in school, work, life in general, where I’m living, my clothes, etc) I start feeling depressed almost. I get this sense of like “what’s the point if I’m not changing and trying new things.” This change almost fuels my creativity and happiness. I become this bright person when I get to try something new, however with that being said. I also find myself liking to have something stable in my life. For me it’s my mom, but for your brother it might be you (I honestly would just communicate this to him, I respect straightforward kind communication so much). As for me in a relationship, I feel like I love adventures, yes, but having that one person to go on them with me is what I love most. ISFP’s like to be alone together if you know what I mean. As soon as the population in the room reaches about 6-7 I’m out. 
5	I'm an ISFP married to an ISTJ, and in the beginning it was hard.. like I wanted more freedom.  But, then we had kids... and I guess that is what grounded me.   I dont necessarily mean that in a bad way.   For me, it's just what ended up working out and stablizing me more, even though I daydream about moving crazy places a lot still.  Me and my husband talk about  travelling more when our kids are older or retiring somewhere by the coast.  But, my kids mean so much to me that I'm not sure I would want to be far from them.    \nAnd, my husband understands how much I crave freedom and tries his best to accommodate me and give me an open schedule with little restraints.  It's super sweet of him, and it's how he takes care of me. 
3	Oh my God. I am an ENFP and this is exactly how I am, it got me right in the feels. So this is how my family sees it...what a wake up call. Thanks for the post OP.
1	There are more factors at play here then personality type.\n\nOne clear example is the risk of getting super involved in a relationship. Look at divorce rate and male suicide levels afterwards 17 times higher for men\n\nThere are a bunch of smaller problems as well that you can look into and explore. Such as who has the rights to producing children... The father truth be told has no say.\n\nTake all this with a culture that CONSTANTLY says "all girls are hoes/the same" and you got yourself a broken dynamic between the sexes\n\nThere might be some guy out there for you and I would honestly say hurry up and get married (if that's what you want idk you) because these Dynamics are only going to worsen.\n\nBest of luck
30	Is anyone else mostly immune to compliments, but very susceptible to criticism?	I notice often that I don't truly care when people compliment me for something, unless I personally strongly agree and believe it's right. Like, when I was a kid my drawing skills were highly praised but I thought (and still think) I suck at it so the compliments didn't do much for me.\n\nHowever, criticism does always get my attention. Whether it's aimed at me or something I like, criticism always gets my attention. Especially when it's very mean-spirited and aimed at something I like, I really can't stand that. It's kinda annoying, I wish I could care less.
16	Yep. Compliments don’t do much for me either. Criticism on the other hand can ruin my entire day and leave me in tears, depending on how harsh/what kind of criticism it is. 
11	I really care about compliments and I want them, but when I get them I go shy-mode and reject them lol.\n\nAlso criticism hurts my soul but I keep thinking that I will get better if I listen.
7	Sometimes I crave compliments - showing off my art to my friends or whatever - but as soon as I receive one I feel very uncomfortable and instantly dismiss it.
2	What if the criticism is not mean spirited and is simply an honest and fair appraisal. Something which you will later agree with given time. How does that go over?
1	Exactly.
1	YES because no one is harder on me than I am on myself.  
3	The 7 Work Habits of Highly Effective Introverts	
21	Friends = Flaws	Does anyone else feel like they cant have a close, lasting relationship with anyone because everyone has at least one MAJOR flaw?\n\nIf I spend too much time with anyone, I end up hating them for a little bit (this usually goes away in a week-half a year) and it makes me feel like I’m not compatible with anyone.\n\nI know I personally have many flaws like who am I to be so picky but idk this isn’t working for me
6	Nobody is perfect and unless you are in a deep relationship with somebody by circumstance (war, sexual partner, strong belief, family etc.) You will always drift apart.\n\nWhy do think there is a criminal underground? Those guys hate each other! It because they have one thing in common, in this case money.\n\nLet people present the best that they are. Dont poke and pry for everything because they will show you it. \n\n\n\n 
5	Yep. Completely relate, and it’s probably *my* biggest flaw. When I was younger my mom was worried I would never make real friends because I would constantly just move on from people. Now, I have a lot of friends, but I can still be like this with really close friends. I have a main friend group, and like 2 smaller, slightly less close friend groups. I finally decided to leave my main friend group this week because it felt kind of exclusive and judgmental of people outside of our ‘group’. Really, it’s mostly one of my friends who is like that, and the rest are kind of indifferent to others, but I was just feeling kind of trapped.\n   I think emotional vulnerability is really, really difficult, and sometimes it is easier to focus on flaws and move on from that relationship than to stay and continue growing closer.
2	I can relate. I avoid this by not spending enough time with anyone to get fed up with them lol. 
2	Yeees this is why I need days of alone time at a time 
2	I'm 100000% this way. I'm way too critical and can't get really close to people. But there are two people I value dearly in friendship. The others, meh.
1	honestly, I think it's part of all relationships.  Friends, family, lovers, whatever... if you spend long enough with anyone they will annoy the HELL out of you.  I think that goes for any personality type, but maybe some types are just better at ignoring it or moving past it.    This is why alone time is very important for me to be sane. 
1	Especially if they aren't trying to better themselves.. I can relate to a degree.
7	Resources for typing INFP vs ISFP	I recently started looking into mbti and found it interesting so I did a few tests. At first I thought I was INFP, and some of it really fits, but some does not. I've been doing cognitive functions tests to see, and they mostly give me ISFP instead. When I read the descriptions and differences, I feel like I could be both.\n\nI also had a test say I was an ENFJ, but that just sounds strange to me. I am, however, much more outgoing than what people expect from an introvert when I am comfortable and well.\n\nDo you have good resources that help with typing IxFP?
2	[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5zr3jf/differentiating_infp_vs_isfp_masterpost/?st=j4uyrx7z&sh=b292ca9e) is a good link. I was in the same boat as you, but this post made it clear that I'm an INFP.
2	Is young Thug an ISFP?	His high Fi and Se is pretty evident and I think he values Ni over Te\n\nhttps://www.gq.com/story/young-thug-best-rapper-alive-interview\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyCTZ8c-trc
1	I really hope so
1	Yes he definitely is an ISFP imo
4	Cant get over a girl	Anyone else ever had this problem? I know any type can go through any conflict but I just thought I’d get the pov of fellow isfps and how they deal with a problem like this. Maybe you guys know something i dont that would help me out? Idk. 
3	Did you have a breakup or is it a crush?
3	stay busy & talk to other girls
3	yeah. it’s rough. real rough for me. like unhealthy. best thing to do is stay distracted.
3	Thanks for the advice guys, ill do my best to heed your  advice. Shit has me fucked up but knowing how you guys go about this makes me feel better. Much love ❤️
2	istp here, i'd tell you what to do but.. do what you gotta do......... and cut any way u can try to reach contact, block numbers, social media, etc
1	best way to get over a girl is to stop cold turkey. block her on all social media and let time heal your wounds. after your feelings for her die down, maybe be friends with her.
-4	Since ISFPs live in the moment I don't think it should be an issue unless you still allow her a place in your life. So let her go then go distract yourself with some shiny new toy 😉
14	Non isfp friends	Does anyone else ever feel like they care way more about their friends than their friends do about them? Like I drive hours every couple days to go hangout with them and drive them around and I plan everything and never ask for gas money... And I feel like they never really are very appreciative. But they're still good people.\n\nApologies for the rant-like post
8	Hmmm if we’re being honest, this isn’t true for me. I have a couple of really amazing friends who reciprocate, and for the people I’m not as into, they tend to care more about me than I do them. \n\nBut I tend to feel bad about the fact that they care about me more so I let these people treat me like shit for a little bit (I.e. doing all kinds of favors for them or putting up with their BS) before distancing myself from them completely. 
3	I’m an INFJ and I go to great efforts for my friends, often times more than they will. 
2	Yeah I felt that before. I need some appretiation too. I'm lucky so my friends actually ask for me and such, but I'm the one that goes on a 4h train trip to their houses lol.
2	I think you might speak different love languages, check that theory out too, maybe you show love and care in a different way from them 
1	Yup.
17	what is this feeling.....	woke up with tears in my eyes ..   \nfeels like there is no more confidence to run out for me \n\nhate the way I am....   \n\n\nWhat a good fucking morning. 
5	Aww, I’m sorry !! :(. \nI’ve had a lot of days like that, too, lately :/.\nI hope something awesome happens to you today!!\n
3	Sending you some love 《3
-1	Welcome to the real world. We are all unhappy. Post your breakfast on social media and buy some consumer goods, everything is going to be OK. 
8	I dont value my art at all	Its often said that isfps art are everything to them but to me its not,  i dont value it at all. Actually i care more about impression and feelings my music/artworks gives others. What's about you?
5	I value my paintings in that a lot of emotional energy goes into creating them. I spend around 20 hours on each one which takes a week or two.  When I look at the finished product I feel the value of every second spent, every thought I had while painting it, every podcast listened to during the process and whatever profound life events occurred during that time. I'm more of a photocopier sort of painter than a creative artist so I can't imagine how anyone else would get any emotional value from my work. Regardless, people seem to like them and that's a big motivator for me to keep painting.
4	Yeah i care about the impression my art makes. If people appreciate it then i feel like my effort was worth it. If they don't, it really upsets me and i guess that's why people say "isfp's art are everything to them"
3	Well most of the time I take photos for my own satisfaction. So having a final product im satisfied with and proud of is important. But this changes when I print. When I print a photo it's meant to be shared with somebody specific, this isn't something a couple followers will glance at for a few seconds, this is a photo of the subject, and it's ment to be special to them.  So kind of going off what OP said, when I'm making a photo for somebody else, what's important isn't how great I did; it's the emotions caused when I give this person a photo of themselves that's so much better than some school year book photo or a selfie or whatever. The value of my art is the 'wow' in a person's eyes when they see the outcome I give them
2	I value my ability to make music and I value my instruments and I value practice. I don't get attached to songs or what I play though! Dust in the wind.
1	if i'm in an arty mood and actually create something its usually for the shock value
11	Questions about ISFPs (vs INFP) for self-typing	I score IxFP and want to see more of the ISFP side of things. I'm leading Fi 100%. Researched cognitive functions, but curious on real world examples of middle ISFP functions. Maybe others are curious about ISFP vs INFP as well:\n\n1) Are you prone to spilling food or are you generally on top of your body and surroundings? I'm accidentally sloppy. I've spilled some ramen in my time. \n\n2) I go for a run when anxious/upset. Is that common for you? I used to shoot hoops for hours when upset too. I wasn't WMBA awesome, but something about action gives me clarity. \n\n3) I fell away from sports when I didn't make team cuts. Lost love for sports even. Inferior Te at its finest. Have you experienced this? \n\n4) How into writing are you? \n\n5) How into books and reading are you? Favorite genre?\n\n6) Do you ask what if questions when hyper? How do you act when hyper?\n\n7) Sometimes I wear makeup, but only to reflect some emotion inside, like power. Does that seem familiar?\n\n8) I hate when ppl move stuff around on me (pots, pans, etc) Do you? (Can't tell if this is parental Se, or shadow Se)\n\n9) Is it painful to leave the house when you feel uncomfortable with how you look (without showering, messy hair" etc)?\n\n10) Are you meticulous with anything?\n\n11) Do you rewatch films multiple times or seek out new ones? Which do you prefer? \n\n12) How do you know you're not an INFP?\n\n13) How does your Ni manifest?  And Se?\n\n14)  Anyone in fiction (books/shows/movies) that reminds you of yourself? \n\n15) What are you confident about? \n\n16) How do you feel about manual labor? \n\n17)  What annoyed you in school? What did you love about it?\n\n18) Are most of your daydreams attainable? \n\n19) Does your Ni make you feel like things will work out? Or do you need evidence for that?\n\n20) Do you feel like a "good" person or more gray? \n\n21) How impatient are you with things that don't apply to you?\n\nThank you! Whatever you can answer helps. 
8	1. No. I mean, I’ve spilled stuff on occasion, but I’m generally pretty aware of my surroundings. I sometimes am baffled by other people when they seem to have no perception of theirs.\n\n2. I don’t run, but I should. Instead, I self-medicate with drugs. I don’t often get upset per se, but I do feel like I have a big fucking hole in my soul.\n\n3. Never cared for team sports at all, not even watching them on TV, I’m not very competitive. I was super into skateboarding for a long time though, which is more about competing with yourself I guess.\n\n4. Don’t like writing really, I’m more into making visual arts and music.\n\n5. I like books, but I love movies; comedy, mystery, sci-fi, horror, adventure\n\n6. I’m extremely mellow, don’t really get hyper. At most, I might do something goofy or babble some nonsense when I’m feeling full of myself.\n\n7. I’m a guy so I don’t wear makeup. \n\n8. Hm.. I dunno, never thought about it so I guess it doesn’t bother me.\n\n9. It’s painful to leave the house in general cuz I just hate leaving the house but not because of my appearance. I have messy dreadlocks, only shower a couple times a week, and wear the same dirty pants for days at a time so I always look disheveled anyway and I don’t really care. I actually am not usually a smelly person believe it or not, but when I do start getting smelly that’s when I can become self-conscious.\n\n10. My work. I can be a perfectionist when it comes to my creative projects. I mix concerts and records for a living and I’m always making the tiniest adjustments, trying to squeeze every last drop of awesome out of every song/show I mix. Nothing fills the hole in my soul like when the mix is perfect and the band is feelin it and the crowd is going nuts.\n\n11. I love getting/watching new films, I got upwards of 800 films in my collection (which I am also meticulous about organizing) There also are some films I have rewatched many many many times.\n\n12. I don’t know for sure but tests have given me ISFP and when I read descriptions of the types I feel pretty textbook ISFP, also my wife agrees. The only other type I might have some traits of is ISTP.\n\n13. I don’t know, I haven’t really educated myself about the functions.\n\n14. No one comes to mind at the moment\n\n15. It took a long time, but I’ve become confident in my work. I’ve had enough success that I know I can consistently produce at least ‘good’ sounding mixes. I’m not super confident in general though.\n\n16. I like getting the exercise when I have to load equipment, but I have minor back problems so it can get hard on me. I prefer sitting behind my mixing board.\n\n17. I hated homework the most I guess. And writing like research papers and shit. It wasn’t too bad tho, I was lucky enough to get good grades without having to study. Art and science were always my favorite classes.\n\n18. Sometimes I daydream about having a normal, secure, 9-5 desk job, but I know that if I actually had that I would fucking hate it. Related to that, my daydreams often also include having a lot of money, which is something I have mostly accepted will probably never happen as long as I keep doing what I’m doing. (Unless I get really lucky) \n\n19. Like I said, don’t know much about the functions, but I guess I feel like things will work out. I stress about my future often, but I just go with the flow. \n\n20. I think I’m a decent person. But I’m quiet and I think I look mean when I’m concentrating/thinking so people might misjudge me sometimes.\n\n21. I might be more patient with things that don’t apply to me than things that do.
5	I have read the INFP and feel like it doesnt apply to me at all.  I'm not altruistic, I'm not good all the time... in fact, I feel like I'm much more prone to selfishness.    I really dont feel like there is a lot in common with the INFP vs. ISFP... yes, I know they share a lot of letters, but in the descriptions, not so much. 
3	lol this reminded me of one of those myspace surveys\n\n1. I spill and drop everything.\n2. Exercising wouldn't help me if I'm upset.\n3. I've never played a sport. Never wanted to.\n4. I'm very into writing.\n5. I love reading, but I've been in a reading slump for a long time now.\n6. I act...hyper when hyper. I ask "what if" questions when I'm upset.\n7. I wear makeup because I enjoy putting it on and it makes me look better. Tho I guess what kind of makeup look I do depends on my mood, look I'm going for, etc.\n8. I hate when people move stuff around for me if I confuses me.\n9. I leave the house looking like shit all the time. It's my "look" now.\n10. I'm only meticulous if I care about what I'm doing.\n11. Depends on my mood. I do like to re-watch stuff tho.\n12. I don't really match the description of an INFP.\n13. No clue lol\n14. Nope\n15. I'm only confident when I know what I'm doing.\n16. I hate manual labor. I am a weakling.\n17. I hated everything about school lol\n18. Yep. Most of my day dreams are set in reality.\n19. I don't think about the distant future too much, so idk.\n20. I'm a good person overall.\n21. I'm very impatient lol
3	I'm an ISFP.\n\n1. Not really, except when I'm stressed out. I become super clumsy when I'm on edge, but I guess it's a normal human thing rather than a function thing.\n2. I go for a walk when I'm extremely stressed out, or I do watercolor after watercolor. I have to engage my physical senses in something, even if it means hitting the desk or breaking things. But walking usually gets me to feel better.\n3. I don't like sports, so, can't say. But I have the same kind of issue. If I can't succeed on the first time, I tend to give up and get depressed.\n4. I'd love to make writing a living. I often write, whether it's my novel, short stories, or in my diary.\n5. I used to read a lot as a kid, but now I don't have the time and energy anymore to do so like I used to. But my favourite genre is coming-of-age stories.\n6. When hyper, I make a ton of plans that I regret several minutes later, I tend to fidget an extreme lot and I can't keep my thoughts together. It rarely happens, though. \n7. No. I wear makeup because I like the way I look with it, and I like doing it too.\n8. I don't relate to this. However, I feel extremely uncomfortable when there's too much movement around me. Like, people moving around, being noisy, or too much sensory stimuli.\n9. Yes. I never leave the house if I don't look "perfect". I have to please myself first, then go out of the house.\n10. Yes. I can be extremely meticulous.\n11. I'm not much of a movie person anyway, but I tend to watch the same ones over and over, or stick to one genre.\n12. I relate more to Se than Ne. My consideration of things is more based on what is concretely here in the moment, rather than abstract and "away from reality" possibilities. Also, my imagination is very "earthy", it has to have a root somewhere in reality. I base all my characters on people, for example. I don't like multicoloured designs either. I stick to what could work in reality.\n13. Worldbuilding, creativity, and insights. I think in symbols, mainly, and I tend to associate people with various things of my own, for example (like, for example, someone's flower is the cornflower, their colour is blue, and their card is the Ace of Hearts). I don't trust my Ni enough to let it lead me in the world, but I play with it (that's how I figured out I was ISFP, not INTJ). \n14. Rose Lalonde from Homestuck. \n15. I'm confident I can bring out many, many ideas into physical things. I'm also confident I can get back on my feet no matter what happens, and that only my own internal compass won't ever fail me.\n16. Not fond of it. I'm overstimulated quickly.\n17. I hated school for the most part. I liked learning things, but I picked them up so quickly I got bored and I just doodled all the time. I only listened when I was interested in the topic or if I liked the subject (English, French, art, sometimes chemistry and biology). I got scolded several times for that, and I even got kicked out of a class on my senior year because the teacher thought I wasn't listening. In high school I even got as far as skipping because I felt like I had no purpose. School made me depressed and stressed because it's like your grades determine your worth as a person.\n18. I think so. It's not like flying into space, it's more like kissing someone or planning a future with them. It's grounded. Again.\n19. I internally feel it will work out, but yeah, I kind of need evidence. However, I still have this little voice in me that says "yes". It's difficult to explain.\n20. I don't bother with that. All I know is that I'm reliable, I'm responsible, and I treat others like I want to be treated. It's their problem if they choose to act like assholes, not mine.\n21. Depends. But usually I don't care.
3	1. I spill stuff every now and then. And I really hate when I do so ha ha. I don’t mind having a small splotch on my shirt because I can wash it.\n\n2. When I do exercise, it because I’m bored tbh. I think I shut down when I feel some extreme emotion.\n\n3. I’ve experienced this somewhat. Not a sport, really, but I used to love being in the band in high school. Due to the rigor, I quit. And I still like basketball, I’ve just never found the time to play it.\n\n4. I prefer music and painting to writing. I like poetry alright, though.\n\n5. I’m not into books that much. My favorite genre of book, however, is grimdark fantasy.\n\n6. I don’t ask questions when hyper. If I am, I try to do something to ease the hyperactivity (exercising, talking, being jittery).\n\n7. I rarely use makeup. When I do, I don’t really use it to reflect an emotion rather to feel confident or fancy.\n\n8. I don’t mind stuff being moved around me. It might depend on how much stuff and what was done with said stuff though.\n\n9. It is disappointing and uncomfortable whenever I leave a little unkempt. I need to at least shower.\n\n10. Projects of any kind are what I’m most detailed with. School projects, painting, etc.\n\n11. I used to rewatch films when I was younger. Now I usually prefer to look for something I haven’t watched before.\n\n12. Not really sure I can say myself. I still new with cognitive functions lol.\n\n13. I can’t really say much for that, either.\n\n14. Never really had a character that made me think that I was them. There may be characters that have the same interests as me that I can somewhat relate to.\n\n15. I’m confident in the potential in my abilities. I’m capable of doing lots, I just need motivation.\n\n16. I don’t mind it. I tend to be lured into jobs that require some form of physical work as opposed to front desk jobs. \n\n17.  The only things that annoying in school is homework. My favorite part about school is meeting up with some friends at lunch or doing a fun project or class.\n\n18. Meh...not really...to be honest some are realistic but some are not.\n\n19. Yeah. Sometimes I do try to have a positive, but realistic outlook on things. I feel that it’s healthier to do so, in my opinion.\n\n20. I definitely feel like I’m in a gray area. Not a bad person, but definitely a person that needs to work on things in life.\n\n21. Yeah, I can be impatient with things that I find boring or things that don’t interest me.\n\nHope this helps! I’m actually in the same boat as you are when it comes to being an IXFP.
3	(ISFP)\n\n1. Um... not really, no.\n2. Yes, definitely. Doing a workout, dancing, taking a hike, going to the gym, ANYTHING physical or outdoors helps to settle my mind when anxious.\n3. Yes, actually. The only sports I stuck with were sports I was naturally talented at from the start, which probably wasn't a good thing in retrospect.\n4. I would like to be more into writing and admire people who are, but I'm just not. I do like reading, though.\n5. I love reading. Self-help stuff, fiction (more realistic fiction, though), informative stuff in subjects I'm interested in, etc.\n6. Um... when I'm hyper, I kind of point out more stuff in the environment/comment on it than ask "what if" questions.\n7. Yeah, definitely. I do that with the way I dress, taking care of myself, etc. It all feels like a reflection of the inner state.\n8. I don't know. I think it would get annoying if I had wanted stuff to be a prearranged way, yeah.\n9. It depends. If I'm not looking how I would want to be represented as or how I'm feeling in that moment, then I would feel uncomfortable, yeah.\n10. VERY detail-oriented with stuff like art, homework assignments, cleaning, etc.\n11. I think I like to do both. There are definitely favorites that I'll rewatch again and again, or series/genres that I'll continuously explore within, but I also do get bored with the same old movies and want to find new ones that pique my interest & emotions.\n12. Honestly, I just can't relate to the descriptions/explanations of an INFP. The idea of living in a world that is idealistic and full of fantasy sounds beautiful and amazing, but I just know I don't naturally live in that type of world and am much more in touch with the world in a visceral sense.\n13. Se - constantly wanting to do stuff to experience the world depending on my values/emotions/whim. Ni - for some reason, this most prominently manifests for me as a love for crossword puzzles, riddles, intuitive problem-solving (I enjoy math for this reason, strangely enough).\n14. Hmmm... I usually don't see ISFP-esque characters in fiction much. We as people tend to be pretty uninteresting from the outside xD I relate more to like, musicians and artists in pop culture (Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Mozart, etc.)\n15. I'm confident about... my ability to cooperate with people, my ability to live mindfully and in the present, my particular artistic abilities (dance, yoga, music), my ability to stick close to my values and morals no matter what anyone else says or insinuates.\n16. I don't mind it. It can be a nice escape from reality as a job for a little while, honestly.\n17. What annoyed me in school were social hierarchies, peers who conformed to whatever was trendy and didn't seem to ever have opinions of their own, peers/teachers who complained incessantly, classes that felt pointless and overly abstract (trigonometry, I'm talking to you ;)). I LOVED reading, getting close to teachers I liked and could relate to, artsy classes (music, visual art, etc.) even though I didn't end up pursuing anything like that professionally, and having a few close friends that made the school day more bearable.\n18. Yes, definitely. I try my best to make them happen as a form of keeping in touch with myself, so to speak. (Whether it's something random like going to a certain concert, playing a certain video game, doing a certain yoga position, etc.)\n19. I think my Ni has gotten to the point where I can trust that things will work out. It takes a lot of effort sometimes, though :/ which is what having a lot of good people around you helps with a bunch.\n20. I feel like a good person, yes. I think this is probably due to genuinely believing in and practicing a strong set of values that is nonetheless open to growth with cathartic life experiences. I don't like the idea of living life as a person who is internally morally ambiguous.\n21. Not too impatient. How impatient am I with things that do apply to me, though? VERY ;D
3	1. I'm prone to spilling food, accidentally scraping/cutting myself, bruising, etc. I'm just extremely clumsy lol\n\n2. Exercise isn'ttt my kinda thing XD I'm a musician so I lean more on playing my instruments or listening to music when I'm anxious or upset. If I can't do either I tend to find something to look at and find the beauty in it to calm myself down\n\n3. I did experience something similar about a year ago (I'm so sorry this happened to you btw). Like I said, I'm a musician and so is my boyfriend's roommate. My boyfriend's roommate just believes that he knows everything about music and that if you believe anything different then you're wrong, so whenever I made comments about music he would shut me down or whenever I played my instruments he'd start playing his louder. I couldn't write any music for the better part of a year and had a breakdown about it until I forced myself to just sit at the piano for a good 20 minutes\n\n4. I used to write all the time, but not so much anymore. I still live when I can though\n\n5. I LOVE reading. The kind of genres that I lean toward are adventure or character growth stories. I can read anything as long as it paints a picture in my head\n\n6.  I do ask a lot of questions when I'm hyper lol My brain is all over the place and my body becomes restless. I talk a lot, fidget, and always have to be doing something\n\n7. I can't makeup. I wish I could, but I'm not patient enough for it XD\n\n8. I also hate when people move stuff around! I just find it and put it back\n\n9. I'm just a more conservative dresser, so I feel uncomfortable showing my stomach or upper thighs and will refuse to leave the house if I'm showing too much\n\n10. I'm very meticulous with how I cut my food, clean, and organize things\n\n11. I get bored with the same thing, so I find new things and will usually cycle back around years later when I've forgotten it\n\n12. I know I'm not an INFP because my boyfriend is one XD He's always thinking about all of the new things he can do and new possibilities whereas I tend to go with the flow more. He comes up with all of these passionate dreams that he has no idea how to accomplish them and I think of all of the steps he can take to get there\n\n13. My Ni manifests as me having to figure things out on my own. I get frustrated when people try to force me to do or see things their way. I have to feel it out myself. My Se manigests as me noticing small details such as differences in smells or sounds, or focusing on aspects of the things that I see that most of the other people I know wouldn't care about\n\n14. I used to be a huge fan of Avatar the Last Airbender and I feel like I relate a lot to Zuko. How calm, reserved, and bashful he is in later seasons mixed with how he's ready to jump on any new opportunities and learn more about himself and the way the people as well as the entire world  works around him\n\n15. I'm not too confident about much XD Maybe my hugging abilities???\n\n16. Manual labor is...okay. I'm fine with doing it if I have to, I'd rather not if I don't \n\n17. I. Hated. Projects. I never did them. Ever. I hated having to research things and then compare them to other things and...uh. Too much work. I also hated how crowded the halls were and how noisy it was. I loved my music classes and how easy it was to connect with the people there without even having to speak\n\n18. Almost all of my daydreams are attainable, I just need to focus on them to get them done\n\n19. I hope that things will work out, I just wait and see if they do\n\n20. Most times I geel like a good person, if I do anything I feel is "bad" I sulk on it for a while\n\n21. I'm just generally impatient so very lol\n\nI hope this helps you!
2	1. No\n\n2.  Yes. Physical activity clears my mind.\n\n3.  Yes. Se is competitive and hates to lose, but dominant Fi (backed by Se) can also lead you to become bored before you perfect your skills.\n\n4. Not into writing, but I’m told I’m pretty good at it.\n\n5. Love to read. Historical nonfiction, sci-Fi, and fiction young adults\n\n6. No, I don’t usually entertain hypothetical scenarios. When I’m “hyper” I play a sport, run, hula hoop, run errands, or just find a way to be moving.\n\n7. I wear a little make-up but not enough to look like I’m wearing make-up\n\n8. It pisses me off big time when people move my stuff. Also if they handle it roughly, pilfer through my things, disrespect my space...\n\n9.  I don’t know how to answer this. I always look sloppy but I also like the way I look, if that makes sense? Like I’ll leave the house dressed like a hobo or a clown but I still think my face looks pretty. If I had like...a black eye or something no, probably not. I’m pretty vain about my appearance, even though it’s a low-effort look. Hope that helps\n\n10. Yes. I’m meticulous with projects that I’m working on related to my hobbies (or school, once upon a time) and anything I pride myself on. \n\n11. I rewatch classic movies and listen to favorite songs over and over. I take comfort in the nostalgia and take a “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach to activities I enjoy.\n\n12. This sounds mean to INFPs, but to answer your question honestly: I don’t relate to them as much as I do other SPs. I find them wimpy, awkward, whiny, and kind of annoying. Their humor is odd, their interests don’t appeal to me, and their heads are in the clouds.\n\n13. Ni manifests as unchecked paranoia about other people and Se...well. I reek of Se. The wide eyed look, the way I carry myself, attention to detail, reflexes, short attention span, vanity, etc.\n\n14. Alabama Worley from *True Romance*, Both Peter and Joanna from *Office Space*, Chris from *Welcome to the Jungle* (the Jean Claude Van Damme movie)...umm..Jennifer Lopez in that *Monster in Law* movie...\n\n15. My looks and intelligence, although my confidence in both has begun to wane as I get older\n\n16. It’s the only way to work without being bored off my rocker\n\n17. Loved school. Even liked the social aspect of it. Nothing really annoyed me, except maybe math classes\n\n18. I don’t really daydream. I have fantasized about people but not much else. And then when those people were available to me, I sabotaged the relationship. So not really daydreams so much as regret. I think daydreaming is kind of a waste of time and boring.\n\n19. It used to. Not so much anymore.\n\n20. grey\n\n21. incredibly 
1	Is it bad form to post to 12 day old comments?  I think this is an interesting thread and questionnaire.  I've typed isfp by verification through study, insofar as the first four functions are concerned.  Shadow function gets a little dicey and I've tested as both infp and enfp, though I'm certain I lead with fi (aka an introverted judging function).  My biggest issue is that I seem to be higher in Ne than Se most days (even when I was a kid) though it's almost as if I use them equally.  I do have a theory about dominant introverted judging functions and the way our perceiving functions manifest but I won't get into that rn, lol.\n\n1.  No, I don't spill food on myself.  I'm not particularly conscious of my surroundings but I am very aware of my own body.\n2.  If I'm overly anxious or upset I'll do a bunch of chores.  I'm very active and I love running in particular so that kind of thing is daily routine for me (big chores binge, not so much).\n3.  I loved theater until I didn't land the lead in my first college production.  I didn't know what that kind of rejection felt like and was too immature to introspect on it so I decided that my professors knew nothing but that I obviously didn't have the talent I thought I did, so I quit (though I did come back and then quit again, for other reasons).\n4.  Writing got me through a lot of times.  Then I discovered art.\n5.  I love reading, mostly literature and philosophy/psychology.\n6.  I don't really get hyper.\n7.  Makeup-- I love lipstick, red in particular and unconventional colors (like black, green, blue) on occasion.  Otherwise I'm pretty minimal.  It's more important to me to be well groomed than made up and I do have oily skin, so I won't leave the house without a dusting of translucent powder and clear brow gel.  It seldom has anything to do with emotion or feeling.  I dress to match a mood and do a classic, minimalist face.\n8.  I hate it when people move things I use around on me because si id.  If it's not something I directly use, I probably won't notice.\n9.  Yes, it is painful to leave the house if I'm uncomfortable with my appearance but it won't ever have anything to do with messy hair or not showering.  It will have to do with having trouble matching my clothes to my mood, feeling fat, or a gigantic face pimple.  Ha.\n10.  Am I meticulous with anything?  Yes,my morning and night grooming routines.\n11.  I rewatch but I'm not really into movies or tv.\n12.  How do I know I'm not infp?  Because of my underdeveloped si.\n13.  How does my Ni manifest?  Idk, it's kind of just everywhere.  There's nothing particularly organized about my life or my mind but it's all connected and it all makes sense, at least to me.  Organized chaos, I guess.  My head is often in the clouds and I find it nearly impossible to be fully present.  Big events or happenings feel surreal, like I'm out of my body.  Things will just, like, occur to me and I can always connect how I got there but I can never articulate it.  As for Se-- I think that manifests in how I respond to sensual things, like the harmony and resplendence of a perfume melding with my natural skin scent; the flavor and nuance hitting my tongue in a well executed dish; the spiritual experience of certain music; the cold silence of a morning in January... things like that.  My Fi elevates sensual experience to profundity.  At least I think that's what's going on. lol.\n14.  Anyone in fiction who reminds me of myself-- Éowyn, LOTR; Arya Stark, GOT.\n15.  What am I confident about... My sense of self.\n16.  How do I feel about manual labor?  I don't really feel one way or another.  Is the question would I do it?  Then of course.  Is the question am I good at it?  Just tell me what to do and I'll do it and eventually I'll find a more efficient way of doing it.  Lol maybe I don't understand the question.\n17.  I hated everything about school, the social constructs, the expectations, the limitations, the formula you're "supposed" to follow, the game you're "supposed" to play to achieve a completely arbitrary level of success.  The moment I had a say in the  matter I opted out.  If you want to know the truth though, I sometimes wish I placed a higher value on my own education but I'm simply not going to do something I don't want to do and my job and income will never outweigh the things that truly move me.  Education is valuable and there are consequences to not following the beaten path.  However, I value truth to myself over impersonal measures of societal success and I know I'm happier for following my own path.\n18.  Are most of my daydreams attainable... I mean, they're more theoretical than anything so who knows?  Anything is possible.\n19.  Does my Ni make me feel like things will work out, or do I need evidence?  It's more that I know that I'll figure out how to handle whatever happens more than a vision of anything "working out" so I guess neither.  I take things in stride.\n20.  Do I feel I'm a "good" person or more grey?  Definitely more grey.  The struggle to attain "good" is constant and the goal lofty.  But it doesn't mean I don't try.\n21.  Oh, I'm impatient with things that do apply to me.  Inferior Te is very real, lol.  In fact I think I'm more impatient with things that do than don't.\n
9	What's your opinion on satire?	Personally, I kinda view it as humor or a message made by assholes. I could be wrong and there may be exceptions, but from what I've seen satire always has a really snarky, nasty "holier than thou" undertone. It's basically a really indirect way of shitting on something.\n\nI'm also kinda bad at picking up on it, although I've been getting much better at it.
12	I think it is the best kind of humor when done right. The problem is, it hardly ever is, and usually ends up coming off the way you described it. 
8	I love properly done satire. It's one of my favourite kinds of humor. 
3	Maybe there are cultural differences at play in this situation? I'm English and satire is a way of life here.
2	It's a fine art with a needed specific audience. It's not a pc, family friendly dad pun most of the time
1	When people over done it it just made them look like whiny little bitches that are constantly complaining. Specially when they are really making it obvious with their tone. The best kind of satire is done when pointed out in an innocent or neutral way imo. 
1	[deleted]
1	I love satire xD
31	Me: “Why can’t I find true love?” Also me:	
12	Lol I so feel this. One of my "resolutions" for 2019 was to try dating again (26 and always been single) and I only lasted one day before I deleted all the dating apps off my phone because I didn't want to talk to anyone...
4	Hahaha I just went on a date and it was like this! It was going so well and he was bizarre at the end
2	This is so accurate. \n\nAnd every time I’m like....maybe I could date someone I go on r/trashy and I’m like no...
8	Do ESTPs hate us?	I've noticed there's often some awkward friction between ISFPs and ESTPs. As a child I was often bullied (not extremely, but I was definitely bullied), and I think many of them were either ENTPs or ESTPs. They also tend to think I'm weird.\n\nAside from that, I've also befriended a few ESTPs throughout my life, and out of all my friends I find that I've had the most fights with the ESTPs. Sometimes I just say something (unintentionally) that rubs them the wrong way and they get mad at me (for example, my current boss is an ESTP and I had a conflict with him a few times, every time because apparently I hinted at him being a liar, like wtf).\n\nAlso, I notice ENTPs often tend to like INFPs, but as for ESTPs liking ISFPs.. literally one of the first things I find when I enter "ISFP" in /r/estp is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/8j8gzq/isfps_why/).\n\nFinally, I find that we talk past each other a lot. Every time I share an opinion or view I have, I get the (Ti?) reply "and why is that?". Likewise, every time I ask them for an opinion or view they don't really know how to respond. And in general, I'm pretty good at making people laugh, but ESTPs never react to my humor (my ESTP friends sometimes do a forced exhale through the nose).
6	Interesting, I can’t relate to this thread at all. I adore ESTPs, and they have always been well represented among my closest friends and family members.\n\nI love working with them, hanging out with them, joking with them, and adventuring with them in general.\n\nI used to think they were somewhat shallow but then I learned first hand how brilliant they can actually be (my kid is one) and they are kinda some of my favorite people now.
3	"Hate" may be too strong a word, but they likely do experience an aversive reaction. It's even called out by name in the highest upvoted response to the [thread you linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/8j8gzq/isfps_why/). It's called a supervisor/supervisee relationship in socionics, and is charactererized by the supervisor desperately trying to introduce their dominant function (Fi for the ISFP) into the supervisee's life, but since the same function is the ESTP's vulnerable function/point of least resistance, they will resist said efforts even more desperately. This can make the supervisor feel paternalistic while the supervisee just gets drained of energy and feels the need to get away from the supervisor as far and as quickly as possible.\n\nESTP's can probably be particularly baffled (as expressed by the OP in the linked thread) by encountering their supervisors, since they are very seldom confronted with any kind of situation capable of draining their energy. Rising up to and defying challenges, against the worse odds the better, is kind of their thing, after all.\n\nTo better understand their reaction, consider your own vulnerable function/point of least resistance, Ne. The supervisor type of ISFP is the type which has this function as their dominant, but has the ISFP's dominant function, Fi, as their auxiliary. In other words, the ENFP. Your experiences interacting with this type should follow a similar dynamic, where the ENFP tries in vain to impose their strongest function, Ne, upon you, but you will recoil because it is your vulnerable function.
3	ESTPs and ISFPs will generally not associate unless they’re related. ESTPs kind of lack morals, and will range from being complete scumbags (especially when younger) to principled people, but there will always be a sense of a selfish, cutthroat cunning to them.\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with this type, on one hand their inner strength and aggression is actually greatly admirable, but their callousness can nonplus me sometimes. If they are intelligent and good as a person, they can be incredible people.
2	Interestingly enough I've gone from estp to isfp, technically, in the past year. I wouldnt classify myself as purely isfp but taking a step back I think y'all(we?) are too soft 
2	Idk. I have an ESTP acquiantance who I kind of get the vibe from that he's confused by me and wants nothing to do with me for some reason. But then again there were some positive comments from them about ISFPs in the [thread I made there](https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/a69ik5/what_do_estps_think_about_isfps/), so idk. \n\nMade me wonder though, since Fe users usually like to feed off of the emotion and the "mood" in others, might Fi confuse them (ESTPs in particular) since it always strives to display the most "authentic" state, and how we actually feel in the moment? Is that why they would hate us? lol
2	Estp here, my best friend is an ISFP, wouldn't change him one bit, our friendship pretty much goes against everything the supervisee concept claims, pretty sure a lot of the stuff comes down to the individuals themselves other than the types! 
1	I'm unsure if this has happened to me, what do the falling out with friends look like? I've had a few of those and wouldn't mind insight.
1	I mainly have problems with ESTJs. Especially immature ones.
1	Ultra late to this but I had to comment on a comment from the thread you mentioned:\n\n\n>As you are walking down a dirt road you come across a fork in the road. To the left you see a nice sunny meadow. To the right the path goes through dark dense woods. You look at the map and see that the right path is quickest. You are about to head down it when you notice your companion is headed down the left path. You confront him about this. He says he has a bad feeling about the right path.\n\n\n\nLol, oh man.  Those would be my exact words if a friend asked me why I wanted to go through a sunny meadow instead of a dark thick forest.  Darkness and stuff is scary and stuff can hide then pounce on you if you’re not careful.  \n\n\n\nBut yeah, if the guy at the end showed me that he can get though safely by arriving to the spot safe and sound, then I may reconsider my feelings and follow the guy through next time... though I would always feel that fear.  
10	Cant stop replaying this	
1	says vid is unavailable. this works, if it's the same:  \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDJ1YWvlIB8  \n  \nreally cool. thx for sharing
10	What advice would you give another iSFP?/advice you found useful as an iSFP?	wanting to start the new year right and improve myself. What Advice Would You Give Another ISFP?/Advice You Found Useful As An ISFP?
22	Do that thing you always wanted to do but never got around to. Become really really good at something. Don’t take other peoples BS but don’t have a zero tolerance policy either. When you notice that you are unhappy don’t numb yourself to it. Cry a lot and find what is wrong. Don’t touch substances if they become your safety blanket.
13	Don't think of yourself as an ISFP too much, use it as a starting point, don't get fixed in that definition, try doing stuff that are not ISFPish, that's how you grow i think\n\nJust my opinion
8	Put yourself out there even if you don’t want to (I.e. making plans and hanging out with people). Chances are, you’ll like it. 
3	Learn to be more open to criticism (I'm having struggles with this myself, even though I know I should take it), express your feelings more readily, work towards your goals and dreams whenever you can.
2	Getting to learn who more about who you are is a wonderful, vivid experience so be ready for anything - don't deny or downplay your best traits that might not make sense to you (or others) at the moment. 
5	Would you show it to your friends?	 \n\nSo, imagine you have a blog. And imagine you have friends, specially irl.\n\nYou feel like a part of you is there. Not because it is the most important thing for you, but because you feel comfortable to be who you are there.\n\nEven though there is no big information about your personal life, you write on the blog about lot of things that you like.\n\nIRL, you have no problem on telling your friends "hey, I really like this or that".\n\nBut... Would you show them your blog and posts? Would you send'em the link? If no, why not? If so, why?
7	I kind of feel weird about that too. I just don't share it. Some things are really personal you know? Even the phrasing. Maybe you speak in some way in your blog, but another way to your friends. \n\nWhat's funny is that I can share shit with complete strangers, but feel weird with friends lol. 
2	Not sure if it would be too personal to share or you're giving your friends too much credit that they would be interested in something like that? If someone offered for me to read their personal blog I would feel #1 obligated to do so #2 drained af #3 feel overloaded with that person and need to take a step back for a bit.
1	Lol...I have an entire business that could be very relevant for a lot of people and I still don’t talk about it with my friends or family. I rarely tell anyone. It’s just awkward and horrible and I feel guilty for whatever reason when I do. 
2	Thoughts on performances?	
3	Lol I think questions are fine as long as it’s not “pls read the mind of another person that is isfp”\n\n\n
2	Y e s 
1	wh-\n\nwhy dont people just ask in this sub since it already has people in here lol i’ve seen questions all the time 
3	Any construction manager or AEC related workers here?	I been working as commercial construction estimator   \nfor last 5 years and I been dying to change my field.   \n\n\nThing is... idk what the hell I want to do anymore  \nnor do I know if I hate my current position due to responsibilities or office environment...   \n\n\njust want to talk someone with someone in similar field of work. 
2	I don't do anything of that, but I also get kicked with the "I don't know what to do with my life anymore". I wish someone gave me the answer, cause everytime I try to solve this I only get more and more questions... Sorry I couldn't help you.
1	I have also been having those "I don't know what I want to do anymore" feelings. The subreddit /r/findapath may help you. Best of luck, sorry I can't be of more help
6	Can't tell if my interests are changing to conform to my "type" or if I was just unaware of my interests before	Before learning I was an isfp, I definitely knew I had a slight interest in art and aesthetic in general. Growing up my mom always got on me for wanting to rearrange entire rooms of the house all the time, and I'd always admired art but didn't really take too much interest in buying or collecting it. After learning I was isfp I've felt a much stronger interest in art and anesthetics. I can't tell if its genuine and I just wasn't nurturing my interests before, or if it's just me trying to conform to my type. Anyone else experience a change in interests after being typed? 
10	Yes after I found out about my type my interest in anesthesia really grew
7	Yes, it is happening to me right now.\nI took several personality tests a few months ago. Turns out I am an ISFP (sometimes called "the artist"). I didn't understand this result because I never developed any art-related skills. I was more focused on maths/science because I was good at it. But recently, I realized like these subjects are not sparking any interest in me. I am trying to explore new things. I enrolled in dance class and I like it. Also, I want to start playing an instrument and I will start acting classes next month. Maybe I will realize I am really an ISFP.
4	Haha this kind of reminds me of the scene from ‘The Good Place’, where as long as they tried to do good for the sake of doing good, they had a chance to get into heaven. But once they were told that they had to do good to get into heaven, all their good deeds became for selfish motivations, and they were now damned.\n\nSorry, man.
2	What were you interested in becoming before being typed?
2	Anesthetics? You mean Aesthetics, right?
10	Am I Supposed to be Charismatic?	I feel that unless I'm in an environment where I know the people and have a subject to talk about, I'm very quiet and awkward. I'm pretty charismatic, but not at first glance like I've seen it be described. I'm almost definitely overthinking this, but is it pretty normal to act like that?
7	Uh, where did you read that? I guess ISFPs can be charismatic, but not in the same way as Fe users. Fe users can directly charm your pants off, but Fi users have a sort of attractiveness without trying. I swear that the senpai from the ‘notice me senpai’ memes, has got to be ISFP.
5	Idk, are you?\n\nAnyone can be charismatic, it just takes practice \n\nIf your asking about a stereotype then I would mark it as such\n\n
2	I'd say it honestly depends on how you grew up, I wasnt charismatic until I joined a fraternity which made me come out of my shell, before then I definitely came across as awkward more often than not. 
6	Why is ISFP said to be conflict averse? Aren't they Fi users?	Because I thought harmony was a Fe thing.
18	I loathe conflict, can't stand even internet arguments, get anxious over raised voices... I think it has more to do with me being neurological than my type though. I'm pretty sure I've come across a lot of I_FPs on the internet who relish in arguing over their morals with closed minds and refusal to believe they're wrong, ugh...
12	Fi doesn’t care about group harmony but we sure as shit don’t like to feel personally attacked. Plus we have a shameful inferior Te. That coupled with auxiliary Se means we can have temperamental ragey outbursts which can be pretty humiliating, especially later on when we’ve recouped and are trying to reign our emotions back in and guard them.\n\nLike why bother now, we’re already exposed. This is why I hate conflict. Brings out the inner anger I spend most of my time trying to suppress.
8	Hmm true 🤔 However I have observed ISFP to be conflict averse. Perhaps it is to do with inner harmony?
7	I am a smol sensitive little bean I don't want somebody to yell or be mad at me!\n(But if I gotta be the boi and stand up for myself then get prepared for me to actually be kinda stern)
8	Na, just useless unconstructive conflict
3	ok i haaate conflict bc i dont like putting my energy into dumb and/or negative shit but if someone wants to argue.. lets fucking go i got time!! and im a 9w1 its odd ik
3	Nah man. You should read up on it more. Fe users are averse to conflict in and on behalf of the group and Fi users are averse to conflict inside the individual whether thats in themselves or perceived in another person.
3	Seeing life through a Fi-lense makes one sensitive to conflict by having the individual feel as though they are being personally attacked. \n\nAlso, a greater feeling score (regardless of Fi or Fe) is bound to make an individual averse to conflict for the simple fact that feeling functions are, well, *feeling*. Feeling negative emotions is none too exciting for anybody, me thinks.\n\nBesides, as an INFJ myself, I have a rather strong Fe function, but when it comes down to the harmony of the group, or my personal convictions, I’d rather disrupt the harmony. Maybe I’m an anomaly in this sense, but as a type 4, I have a passionate want for personal-expression, and typically find that it’s easier to stand my ground on what I believe in, than it is to lose a piece of myself every time the group disagrees with me. While I’d rather not fight, I don’t surrender either, and given the choice between conforming or being myself, you better believe I’m choosing originality.
5	It's Fi-Se, a synthesized, knock-off, self-serving "Fe". 
1	Fite me bish
1	I’m an ISFP, and for me the closer I am to a person and the better I know them, the more happily and readily engage in conflict with them without always worrying about hurting their feelings with off-color or insensitive jokes, and may even enjoy getting into arguments sometimes because I know that I won’t make myself hated or draw negative attention from a large group of people that will damage my reputation if you accept me. There’s enough of a sense of comfortable harmony and trust that’s been been built up in our relationship for me to be more blunt and harsh with my opinions and feelings with you if we’re close friends and/or family and bickering with each other when we disagree on issues or cracking off-color jokes is just what we do. The less I know you, the more conflict avoidant I become. I’ll speak really softly, I may even become passive to a fault by leaving things up to chance, and just letting things happen when a conflict may need to be started and/or confronted for us to reach a common ground.
11	Merry Christmas!	I always forget to wish my loved ones happy holidays because I'm so caught up in the moment of whatever I'm celebrating to remember! I appreciate this subreddit so much.\n\nFavorite part of the holidays? Favorite way to celebrate? Love ya :)
3	Haha, this time around I was solo, but I like texting my friends and fam! I also make sure I eat amazing food and relax. :-)
2	Favorite way to celebrate is by getting outside in the state parks
2	Sparkling wine and christmassy shit from underneath a blanket. Spend the whole day like that.
4	Any of you fiancially successful?	If so, what do you do
7	I mean I’m still pretty young but my wife and I definitely make more than we need. We have very minimal debt and are managing to put her through school without loans. We’re not at 75k a year but I think people would be surprised at how little it takes to have a comfortable lifestyle with nice things 
5	well i’m only 20, not sure how many 20 year olds make 75k but i feel the number isn’t too high
3	Define "financially successful" 😉
1	I haven't graduated college yet so I have no idea! 
1	I've been pursuing a career in medicine for the last 10 years. Half of that was gone to waste because of a useless science undergrad. The other half was to study paramedics, but it's really competitive where I'm at. Thinking of going back to school for nursing and that's another 4 years.\n\nI've always been on the path of science/medicine. Mainly because I'm good at it and my parents pushed me towards it. \n\nI've always had interest in commerce/entrepreneurship but never found a good idea and have a fear of starting.\n\nWhat is your e-commerce business?
5	ISFP or INTJ?	Hello, guys. I need your help.\n\nWhen I take the test from 16personalities, it shows I am a ISFP. But when I take the Personality Hacker's test, it show INTJ. \n\nI have seen they are similar in some perspectives, but what truly differ them in your opinion?
3	16personalities is more accurate than the other one you mentioned. Try taking this - https://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html\n\n\nCognitive functions are what you should be looking at. 
1	Honestly only thing I can think of is the basics : how do you handle confrontation? I am a isfp & I hate confrontation, arguing, fighting & sometimes debating . I also never leave my opinion under comments if I think it’s gonna start an argument or offend someone. Yes!, I’m lil bitch lol I procrastinate a lot and I’m super sensitive, quiet & friendly & I love aesthetics 😊 . Intjs are nothing like isfp’s 🤨 who told you that lie lol. They’re nothing alike 
1	I had the same problem. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell what order your functions are in especially if you are in an unhealthy place mentally. See how you react to things and research how the two types react as well. Also observe which you relate to more when you are happy. For example, do you FEEL the best living and experiencing the present moment or do you PREFER  to think about the future and progress. It’s best to observe what you feel your best doing rather than what you habitually do because these two types can look like each other when they are unhealthy. Sometimes an ISFP seems like an INTJ if they get in the routine of obsessing with their progress and whatnot. Their unhealthy habits are not how they actually are when they are doing great. Or you could just completely not be either type. At least this is what I experienced. Hopefully my crappy advice helped in some way. 👍🏼
1	Look into cognitive functions. INTJ is Ni dominant while ISFP is Fi dominant. Once you figure out your dominant function it should be easy to tell (google for introverted intuition and introverted feeling mbti).   \nYou can also try carefully reading through these socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.   \n    \n[ISFP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ISFP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42492) | [ISFP subtypes](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESI_subtypes)        \n[INTJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ILI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INTJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42488) | [INTJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/15943-INTp-ILI-Subtypes?p=283525&viewfull=1#post283525)    
1	first of all, tests are shit.  \nu want to know who you are. speak about yourself.  \n2 profiles are contextual, u can be both in different contexts
-2	How can you even get the two confused? lol\n\nThese types are nothing alike. I can see you getting INTP confused with ISFP, but INTJ? Nah, no way.
2	I don't relate to many of these things	I did this 16Personalities test and I got ISFP. After reading the description of this type and some things on this subreddit, I don't really relate to many of these things. \n\nThis just feels like another "signs of the zodiac" thing where people only relate to things that actually happen to them and ignore the rest.\n\nedit: I've gone through the test twice and got this result.\n\n??help??\n
3	Maybe you're mistyped. 
2	Yeah, I can't really relate to the vast majority of other ISFPs (especially on this sub) or descriptions on typing websites. I do identify with the functions, though, so that's that.
1	The 16 personalities test is a very brief and I’d say “commercialized” version of MBTI. You also have to be completely honest on the answers, not answer based on how’d like to think you are. 
1	You can read this website. It's detailed. [https://www.typeinmind.com/fise/](https://www.typeinmind.com/fise/) 
1	Check out the 8 cognitive functions and cs joseph youtube channel. I tested infj, then istj, then I thought I was intp, then I was told I was istp before realizing I'm isfp
3	do you guys forgive easily	say I've done something terrible how long would you wait to forgive me. do you hold grudges. 
16	If the isfp was affected by it, then you're pretty much cut out for good. The best you can get out is fake niceties, but inside you are never to be trusted again.
9	I can forgive, but I won't forget
5	They will probably eventually stop having negative feelings but they won’t forget it. They might put up boundaries so that they don’t get hurt again. Like they might not want to be as close with you. But I think if you really sit down and apologize they will forgive you. But I don’t know this person so nothing I say is for sure. 
3	With a lot of mindfulness about my own feelings, I have stopped harboring anger at people and accepted their past actions. But at this best stage, I don't care about them and I wouldn't trust them again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think your best theoretical shot would be to apologize upfront and consistently do caring things/send thoughtful words to the ISFP without expecting anything in return. Be ready to listen when they explode at you with the list of things you did wrong. Repeat unless they tell you to back off.
2	This has been said already but I would forgive and not forget. They'll probably start acting normal pretty quickly but it may or may not be brought up again later, and may or may not change their opinions of you (at least temporarily)
2	If they are genuinely sorry, aka they won't do it again and I see the next step they are taking or the step they already took then sure.\n\nThen I will forgive and forget\n\nMost of the small stuff I just say don't do it again though, apologies are for the bigger stuff\n\n
2	I dunno. I havent been severely offended in my life but I do always give second chances.
12	Anyone into philosophy?	So philosophy is usually considered a very N type thing, but I know I love a lot of philosophy. However, personally I’m only really interested in philosophy as much as it’s useful or relevant. I don’t really care much about things like the Ship of Theseus, even as it relates to identity, because regardless of when it stops being the ship I’m still going to live my life the same way. But things like ethics, existentialism, and absurdism I find very fascinating because they can provide a lot of insight into how I think I should live my life.
5	Haven't read much philosophy in recent years, but in the past I was the most influenced  and inspired by Nietzsche, the stoics, and the existentialists.
2	I'm really into philosophy, especially as it relates to theology.
2	>I don’t really care much about things like the Ship of Theseus, even as it relates to identity, because regardless of when it stops being the ship I’m still going to live my life the same way.\n\nIt can have kinda practical/relevant applications, though. For an example, bakeries that have had their same starter going for years, decades, to centuries since they opened. They'll advertise it as making the bread more profoundly historic, and it's certainly cool in that they've managed to keep it going for so long, but considering that the process of feeding and keeping a starter requires throwing most of it out to replace with fresh ingredients, and the bacteria cultures in it are constantly changing with the environment, so while you could maybe have something interesting and unique lingering in an old starter, it's much more likely that it's ultimately pretty hella similar a much younger one.  \nOr something like an ancient institution that's still operating, maybe even in the hands of the same family. It's certainly intellectually interesting if something lasts for so long, but it still eventually gets to the point that it's only the same in name. If another institution or owning family took its place, the only real difference would be the loss of bragging rights, but the age and continuity still pulls a bit of regard like it makes it somehow fundamentally different and that you're interacting with the very same thing that everyone so many years ago did. But, ultimately, is it really, and are you really, or is it just a notably neat novelty?\n\nIn terms of identity, the main practical application I can think of is using it to let yourself stop clinging to long- lasting negative habits/ attributes because they're integral to some rigid identity, because really after long enough, you won't have the same identity regardless. 
1	I love philosophy, and I didn't even realize it wasn't an ISFP thing.
1	I despise philosophy on the level I’ve been exposed to it. Never really got into it because just a mere dabble into a philosophical conversation hurts my brain. What kind of philosophy are you guys into?
1	i am really interested in the philosophy of the ZFG "Zen of Zero Fucks Given"\n\nit really helped me out when i was depressed. and it really does match up with my personality.
18	Is anyone else tired of all the mind reading requests we’ve been getting on this sub for other ISFP people?	
15	Let's talk about something else then! Since it's christmas eve, here in Slovakia its tradition to give presents this evening. Soo what did you get? In USA Santa gives present in the morning right? What would you reaaally like to get ?\n\nHey, you, there's no bad answer so don't even try writing a reply just do delete it
7	I feel like some dating advice subreddit would be better for that because the people who answer there would be more likely to have experience giving dating advice. Asking people who share four descriptive words with the person they know is not really any more likely to produce a good answer than asking on any other random subreddit.
10	Yeah , it‘s annoying because I know that ISFPs must be hard to understand, but I wish people would just accept whatever ends up happening with their ISFPs in real life *without* going to our subreddit\n\nLike we can’t control your distant ISFP, sorry
2	maybe start an r/askISFP so this one can be left alone
1	INTP female asking: what is this ISFP male thinking?	Okay, so I've been on and off with this ISFP from work, and I'm having a really tough time trying to understand what he thinks of everything. There have been numerous times where I've asked him to be honest and direct with me, but I still feel like he doesn't do that. So, in bullet point format, this is what has been happening:\n\n• We go on a few dates, I ask him where this is going, and he tells me that as much as he likes me, he can never be serious with me (maybe his ex and his mother abandoning him plays some role to this).\n\n• I go to Brussles with him, he is VERY off with me for the 2 days we are there - to the extent that I decide I won't waste my time with him again. Except, on the way home, he begins showing love and apologises numerous times for acting the way he was, and says "you deserve someone that treats you amazing". He says he'll take me out for dinner.\n\n• I go on a few more outings with him, and because I'm no longer in the mind frame of pursuing anything, I am completely and utterly myself. At this point, I have feelings for him, but I know that he doesn't want anything serious with me.\n\n• He seems to like this organic me, and talks about the future, missing me and wanting to be with me. However, what he doesn't know is that I'm beginning to see another guy from work.\n\n• I tell him I've been on dates with guy 2, and he begins to hate guy 2.\n\n• During another outing with ISFP, he mentions that I'm very closed with him, so I tell him to ask me anything - and he asks the last time I slept with guy 2. I tell him that it was a day that ISFP (he) had asked me to meet him, but I didn't have the balls to meet ISFP before I met guy 2 because I felt guilty.\n\n• He changes completely. Completely put off by me, and says things that cut deep. I ask him to be honest with me and tell me if he sees a future with me. He says that he does, but he doesn't want it. I ask him what that means, and he waffles something along the lines of him not wanting to be in a relationship.\n\n• Few weeks later, he's still very off and makes weird remarks here and there whilst still flirting with me. \n\nI don't understand what he's feeling. I've told him numerous times that I want to be serious with him if he wants to be serious with me. But he's hesisitating, and I don't know why. I have feelings for him, and guy 2 is out of my life. 
12	So you lure the guy into a fasle sense of security, making him feel like he can finally start opening up and letting himself be vulnerable... and that's when you tell him you're seeing someone else? Get outta town.
2	I don't think this had anything to do with his feelings. I dated an isfp and he was ready to make it official after the second date, granted we worked together and knew each other for 8 months before he asked me to be official.\n\nWhen any man really likes a woman, he will put forth the effort and not play games.\n\nIt's hard but have an honest conversation and then drop him. 
1	)) stay away from him. INTP here. u need someone who understands the framework of poliamory. as that is the foundation for sane relationships.  hes way to immature. at least  find someone pragmatic
0	[deleted]
20	Just showing some of my art! It's Gordon Ramsay(if you couldn't tell) he's one of my favorite celebs because 1. He's super talented at what he does 2. He's freaking hilarious. So yeah,I decided to draw him. Lol	
1	nice, he looks very happy 
1	it’s a lovely picture! (I’m an INTJ lurker)
1	How nice !
1	I thought it was Conan O'Brien at first
1	Nice Conan O'Brian drawing. 
0	I’d throw hot chip oil at Ramsey.\n\nI cannot stand how serious he takes his profession. For the past year I’ve been doing an catering course in college (Joining an art course next year due to a weird issue I couldn’t join last year) and he makes me hate it with a passion when I see him on TV.\n\nHe’s also pretty creepy.\nYou should pay more attention to what he does.\n\n1. Apparently he would actually hit his “penis” of Gino D’acampo’s head to wake him up when they were on some sort of trip.\n\n2. He also acted extremely creepy towards Sofía Vergara when he was on a talk show with her.\n\n3.He hired someone to take pictures of his father in law through his bedroom window.\n\nEtc. I wouldn’t doubt there has been worst things he’s committed but that’s some of the things I know about.\n\nI ain’t a good person myself but I’d repeatedly stab Gordon Ramsey without second thought if he dared to even increase his voice volume to me....\n\n
5	Greetings from an INFP! I'm in a new relationship with an ISFP girl! I Want to get some insight from you guys!	I've recently gotten involved with an amazing ISFP girl! I want to do everything I can to appeal to her ISFP qualities and make her feel really special! What should I be doing and saying? We have amazing chemistry and really like each other but I want to go the extra mile and really understand her. What would you want your partner to say to you as an ISFP? What would you want your partner to do for you? Of course everybody's different but I imagine I could put all your insight to good use! She's probably in this sub too and if she's reading this, then consider this one giant hug! 
9	Coming from an ISFP female...\n\nBe reassuring about your love and affection. Dont go overboard though; she could think you're trying too hard and get weirded out. \n\nWhen asking her to do something, don't be pushy especially if it might require her to go outside her comfort zone. Things like "hey, could you get me a ____" or other simple favors aren't a problem, but if it's asking her to wear makeup or a certain clothing or something about her personal habits or style, it's could make her feel like you're criticizing her even if you're not. ISFPs don't like being told what to do. Instead, compliment her when she does something you really like, and she'll be more likely to continue doing it because she knows it makes you happy. \n\nAccept her for who she is. She won't be perfect. She will have her quirks that might not make any sense to you. With time, you will see more and more of what makes her HER because she will bring her barriers down the more comfortable she becomes with you. Accept those weird things about her as they come. With ISFPs, you either get the whole package or none at all. \n\nWhen you need to tell her that there's something about her that's really bothering you, be kind and reassuring of your love and affection for her. Let her know why whatever it is bothers you. Be discreet about where and when you tell her-- find a private place away from people. However, don't wait for weeks or months to confront an actual problem. \n\nTry to take an interest in what interests her, even if you think it's boring. She will really appreciate that you made an effort in learning about what she likes. However, don't fake that you're interested in something she likes, she can tell. If you feel you're really not interested in something she likes, be honest with her. She won't fault you for not liking something. \n\nBe honest and transparent with her. Ask her stuff, talk to her. If you're not sure how she might want something, ask her show she would like it. ISFPs love good communication, but don't go overboard and don't be clingy. Spend time with her, take her places, do things with her. She will appreciate that more than all the gifts in the world. \n\nI hope this helps! If you have any specific questions, let me know! 
6	Balance. Do everything in moderation. And remember the small things, they’re actually the biggest.
4	I really like Words of affirmation idk if any other isfp’s like that but the words have to be meaningful not too appearance based . Cuddle with her while sleeping, give her space when she asks, be kind always & I can’t really think of anything else 
2	Compliment her on the things she does, and why they're good. Don't bring this "you're such a goddess" type of INFP compliment, it won't work and will freak her out. 
6	ISFP dating an ISFP?	Has anyone dated someone of their "own kind"? (Sounds so weird saying it like that :P) What's it like? And if you haven't, what would you think it would be like? 
3	Identical relationships are difficult, since you can't really help each other out. I saw a marriage survey somewhere and same type marriages were at the very bottom, next were marriages with same dominant function like INTJ-INFJ. Here are the suggested type matches for ISFPs that are more balanced: [**MBTI types in relationships with ISFPs**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/isfp-articles/288-love-types-isfp-11.html#post22271698).
2	I think I did, he might’ve been an INFP but I’m leaning more towards ISFP and it was the best relationship I ever had 
2	Me and my husband are both ISFP I think and it’s great. 😊
2	It is supposedly one of the best type combinations. Supposedly.
5	What would an ISFP do in this situation	So recently my ISFP friend broke up with his girlfriend. But apparently his gf wasn't contented and started to post false information about him all over social media and inventing stories about him cheating on her. She's a Fe dom, and can get manipulative at times, enough to convince anyone of her 'truth'.\n\nMy friend's a pretty touchy guy, and takes attacks personally, but so far he's said NOTHING about the matter, even to his closest friends. He hasn't done anything to defend himself against slander even though he's had abundant opportunities to do so.\n\nI'm trying to defending him, but I also want to know about his feelings. How private are ISFPs？Is it common for ISFPs to guard their feelings from outsiders？ If so, how can I help ease his distress？\n\nI know I sound annoying, so thanks for your patience if you made it to this last sentence.\n
5	I, personally, have a very hard time sticking up for myself. I feel like everyone has an opinion and they have a right to that opinion. But it's easy to stick up for myselfwhen someone else starts it and I can build off their confidence. I am extremely guarded. But get me talking, I'll tell you anything. Ask the questions. 
5	Fi is pretty private. He may tell his closest friends and family.\n\nI had something similar like that happen to me and I actually didn’t tell anyone. Maybe go ask him? See how he’s feeling. 
5	I think sticking to him shows, to those that may read those false comments, that maybe they're not true.\nIf one person (you) hangs out with him, maybe he's not such a bad person, right?\n\nIf I was him i'd use the "occasion" to take note on those that believe the false information without questioning them.\nFly low and observe other people's reasoning and behaviour.\nIf someone believes shitty and false stuff about me without doubts, then good to know, i'll avoid that person.
3	She wants him to worry and defend himself \n\nIf it's all false the silent treatment is a good option, not even engaging in the bs.\n\nRealize you really cant prove anything in a private relationship, it is all he said she said. Ignoring it and moving on with life is a great option.
3	Yeah I wouldn't go out defending myself or even address the topic unless someone brought it up. But the moment it comes up, I'm usually an open book. Try asking him about it.
5	oof, i think i might not date Fe dominants 😱
2	I too would just ignore the comments, if I were him. (I am also ISFP) because it’s not my responsibility or care if people I don’t know believe me or not. If someone directly asked me then I would tell my side to them. I would also probably only talk about it with close family and my bestfriend.
2	Respect wahmen
1	[sounds about right](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/d1/6b/85/d16b85d9151e5a650261c6a918d5d866.jpg)  \n  \n[don't engage the crazy](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/34/23/92/342392a118bae61ffb0ae0ffb1e93a40.jpg) don't fan the flames.
1	It is difficult to stand up for myself when in the face of an authority figure but ISFPs have limits too. If I’ve been crossed in person and I’ve stewed in it a bit, I won’t hesitate to confront you. \n\n\nI would offer support for sure. 
1	Feels like a waste of time to engage in this kinds of ridiculousness. In the end the people that actually cares will ask me personally and know that I would never lie to them. 
1	I’d talk to her through texting and ask her why she lied about me, then screen shot conversation and post....
4	This r/PurplePillDebate post on ISFPs is the cringiest shit I've ever seen. The comments are so bad.	
2	If I could only see the text and not which sub it was on, I would think that was a high quality shitpost from r/shittymbti
17	How thick-skinned are you?	For me it's rather odd, outright just telling me to "fuck off" or insult me doesn't really bother me that much, but I really despise it when people do the same towards things I like.\n\nOutside of that, it also really depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm super irritable and very easily ticked off, and sometimes pretty much nothing gets to me.
12	I’m very thick skinned and I laugh off practically everything. But, I find that every comment meant to hurt me (and there are very few) does strike somewhere deep inside me. \n\nI’ve noticed this from talking about times people have called me out. First I always think like “oh yeah, they have a point haha” and move on but really thinking about it makes me feel like trash.
11	I wish lol. Not even a little bit :(
5	I'm usually very thick skinned. But when someone insults or mocks something that's very important to me then it can start get to me 
4	Pretty thick skinned. The only way is get insulted is if you're a close friend, saying something very specific about me, to me for the sole purpose of insulting me or someone I care about. (Close friends shouldn't do that anyways no matter how mad or upset they are)\n\nLife's too short to get offended/triggered/angered by stupid people, and stupid things.
5	Depends on the value I place on the person. If its someone I dont give a shit about then what they say doesnt matter at all. 
5	It depends on the intention of the person. People who actively try to hurt me in an argument out of the heat of the moment don't get to me. It's when they say something rude unintentionally, that it cuts me deep.
3	idk, i want to be thick skinned but sometimes some things really irritate me too much and then i realize it's not something to be irritated over. idk\n\nedit: fortunately i usually have time to think about those things so i don't get to act on my irritation
2	I usually get very defensive, so probably not as thick skinned as I'd like to be 
2	I'm just super sensitive to anything that's done to the people I care about. 
2	I'm very thin skinned...
1	if being 'thick skinned' is reflected on one's physical appearance then you'd prolly see my bones under my skin
9	picking a favourite	hi guys! whenever I meet a group of people I always tend to choose a favourite person and the I always stick to them and talk to them the most I kinda of obsess over the person ( not in a stalkerish way) it’s just for instance if I’d have to ask a clammate something I’d always just choose to ask to that person basically I stay shy to everyone but that friend I decide to open uo to. I do this unconsciously but one day one person I don’t talk to as often pointed it out and I was like whattt  Do you guys experience the same thing?
3	that does happen and in my case its almost everytime an INFP or ENFP. i just love those types
2	yes, but I don't do it consciously. I remember taking a class and I was friends w/ 4-5 people that I talked to regularly, but only one guy I really talked to a lot. we just got along well
1	Yeah most of the time they are someone I begin to look up to
1	ahah yes this is me. I gravitate towards one person and latch on to them unintentionally 
1	Yes, I can relate
18	Not an artsy ISFP? I think these might be reasons why. My sister is ISFP but doesn’t feel very artistic. She asked me to explain why that still makes her ISFP. Everyone likes to quickly label her a T or an N but I think that’s incomplete.	
2	"Lack of desire to impress outer world" \n\nWell, that explains some things..
1	What does that mean, “ISFP-T”?\n\nI can see that for me. I’m artistic but it’s not my life or anything.
11	Any other ISFPs that aren't that creative?	I'm on the fence as to whether i'm an ISFP or not. I relate a lot to the descriptions and the cognitive functions, however I struggle to relate to the creativity trait that basically **ALL** descriptions make us out to have. I know that every individual is different and not always rigidly linked to their type description, but it makes me doubt my type a lot, especially when we're labelled 'The Artists'. Could it perhaps be enneagram related as i'm a 6 (known for being less creative/artistic, than say a type 4). Perhaps underdeveloped Se? Anyone else relate or am I probably mistyped?
6	I think "artsy" means a lot more than just drawing/painting. \n\nIt means everything you do has a meaning, and you want to express something through reality (Fi Se relationship). \n\nAnd of course there's lots of things you can do, otherwise all ISFPs would be the same. 
4	I don’t relate personally but there are def ISFPs who are not super artsy/creative.. the few ISFPs I know are super into sports or cooking or something else. \n\nI think if you relate to the functions/descriptions and ISFP fits best you’re probably ISFP. MBTI helps you figure out what kind of person you are, not who you are, so don’t sweat the details so much 
5	I relate. I wouldn't consider myself an "artsy" person but I definitely enjoy hands on and practical work. Played piano for quite a few years but it definitely did not come naturally and was something I had to work really hard to learn.\nNot underdeveloped Se. Just a generic typing. 
1	Sorry, I'm late to comment, but I just subscribed to this sub because I figured out my husband is an ISFP recently (I'm an INFJ).  \n\nSo my husband isn't someone you'd describe as "artsy", but he is super visual & works well with his hands.  He's handy meaning he can fix pretty much anything, can sew, builds stuff, is athletic, an outdoor adventurer & has a good sense of style when it comes to design.  He is a dentist which requires aesthetic ability.  I think the label "artist" is broader than just painting, drawing, etc.    
22	ISFPs and their inner iNTJ	Hi guys,\n\nI’m an INTJ and recently I’ve been thinking about what I’ve observed watching the ISFPs that I’m close to in my life. Let me start by saying, thank you for existing. You guys can be refreshingly genuine and non judgy in a way that makes even shunned people feel accepted like no other type and naturally, as an INTJ, I appreciate that. I secretly look up to healthy ISFPs for their kindness and noble qualities.\n\nI’ve noticed that ISFPs tend to almost seem to have two sides to them, their normal selves, and also a different side which is more withdrawn and contemplative. When in such a mood, the ISFPs that I know reveal their interest in all types of topics such as spirituality, aliens, the occult, conspiracy theories and all other manner of things typically associated with Ni thinking.\n\nI’ve also seen it the reverse where INTJs have a need for self expression in similar ways to what you’d associate with ISFPs (having a certain style about them/artistic expression...).\n\nI just thought it was interesting to bring up, as I’ve noticed this pattern with many type combinations i.e. INTPs with inner ISFJs, ENFJs with inner ESTPs, INFJs having an inner ISTP side to them and so on.\n\nI’ve also noticed that when mature these types become more and more indistinguishable and it becomes hard to distinguish a well rounded INTJ from an ISFP for example  just by their appearance and demeanour, and vice versa.\n\nDoes this resonate? I’d like to know your thoughts :)
14	I'm so glad you've said this! Yes, I've definitely noticed it, too. I can't tell older ISFPs from INTJs -until I get to know them better. ISFPs are definitely more robust/rugged in a physical way, compared to INTJs. My spouse is ISFP. I consider them like hybrid types (halfbloods, lol), half N half S people, who just get more and more N as they grow older. Their INTJ side can get really depressive and brooding, though, because I do think it's them falling into a loop after not getting out of the house for a long time. Still, I do believe that we get more in touch with our weaker functions as we grow older, and we'll be able to wield them with more .. finesse/carefulness, in a healthy manner. Sometimes their Ni will just appear out of nowhere, and floor you. A well-balanced old ISFP is sexy af.
5	Aside from a few INFJs, all of my long term friends have been xNTJ. I’m talking twenty + year friendships.
5	Totally agree. I’m an INTJ - wife is ISFP. Best friends for 13+ years. 
3	I think its the perfect match cuz you can help each other strengthen those inferior functions.
6	INTJ and ISFP have the same top four cognitive functions in different orders, right? So it would make sense that as they mature and even out those aspects that they could appear more similar.\n\nI'm engaged to an INTJ :)\nWe struggle with communication sometimes but this relationship does so much to help both of us grow and become better people. 
13	Just your friendly neighborhood ENTP come to say I think you guys are awesome	I know. You guys are often listed as my “enemy” type. For the record, I don’t believe this. I think you guys are fascinating, intriguing individuals and I always find myself so drawn to you. I love your aloofness, your individuality, and the way your brain thinks. You have this sort of quiet, artistic charisma that makes me want to know what’s going on in your head. \n  Anyway, all I’ve really seen online is that we are not compatible. I say screw that. But I’m wondering what do y’all think of us, the ENTP? 
9	I don’t know that I’ve ever known an “ENTP” but I think compatibility is much more complicated than an MBTI result. I think everyone has the potential to get along 😊
3	I'm an ISFP and my wife is an ENTP. We have a dynamic, challenging relationship--and I don't mean challenging as a euphemism for unhealthy or dysfunctional. We have very different strengths and ways of doing things and tend to spur each other on to further personal growth. Unfailing mutual love and respect, as well as strong communication skills, are key to making this work, but we couldn't be happier.  \n\n\nSocially, I find ENTPs some of the most engaging people to listen to, and enjoy their tendency of being able to take any side of an argument or to adopt a position just to be deliberately provocative, as long as this doesn't become too mean-spirited.
3	I don’t think I’ve ever personally been friends with or known an ENTP well because I tend to mostly hang out with quieter people, but a lot of my closest friends are INTPs, so I’m sure y’all are great as well! I especially love XNTP humor and how you all tend to be pretty independent and free thinking. You’re all pretty cool in my book ;).
3	I married an ENTP when I was way too young to know any better. After 12 years it ended after her 2nd affair and complete inability to take responsibility for her actions or see anything outside of her "correct" way of thinking. Of course, everyone is different, but the NT type in general (at least for me) is okay as a friend/acquaintance but nothing further than that. YMMV
2	I love entps! We definitely tend to be in different crowds, but I have a lot of respect for how you guys can make anything seem interesting. I’ve never met an entp who wasn’t charismatic, so that’s something too.
2	I’m ISFP and my boyfriend is ENTP so... not enemies. I often say I would like to have a holiday in his brain. I can’t argue without crying and he loves a good argument. Must be nice to not take every single thing personally. I don’t understand how you guys are so easy-going about all the things. 
2	Just dropping by to say that as an entp with an isfp best friend, i wholeheartedly agree <3
1	all I know is screw MBTI compatibility. I'll be damned if I started avoiding other people solely based on their MBTI type 🤷 I bet some ENTPs can be cool (even if I've met some annoying immature ones before, from my grade school *cough*)
1	There actually is a lot of theory supporting ENTPxISFP compatibility! Like this: [**https://youtu.be/2VgeyXwLfYI?t=1643**](https://youtu.be/2VgeyXwLfYI?t=1643)
1	I know some entps and you guys are awesome too.
19	Dreaming small	Does anyone else have more reachable/ realistic fantasies when you day dream?\n\nLike, i dont dream about having a mansion in dubai because i know that would never happen so its not that entertaining to think about. But day dreaming about saving up 40K and building my own 800 sq ft adorable cottage with solar panels and chickens in the back yard is so amazing to think about because its so damn reasonable and attainable.\n\nI dont day dream about becoming a famous rock star but i do daydream about performing a few songs in a coffee shop and selling an ep in a tiny record store.\n\nFor me, the more i can envision something actually happening the more i enjoy the day dream. Its sort of like, if you can do it you can dream it rather than if you can dream it you can do it for me. Anyone else find themselves with this inclination?\n\nI guess that makes me less imaginative but its just more fun to think about things that are within my means idk :P\n\nAlso thinking on it further i really dont WANT to be a famous rock star and have a mansion in dubai. So maybe i just my more minimalist tastes.
7	Personally I separate the "fantasy" day-dreaming from planning. Like, it's fun to plan what to do with the money you could get with that job, but I also enjoy coming up with stories and characters in my head. Both are nice and necessary for me.
2	I can't totally relate. I've loved music all my life and definitely want to try my hardest to get music out there, because it's sort of my dream. In that aspect, I daydream really big. In the other things though, I can definitely relate.
2	Yeah, I maybe go as far to say the big dreams are bad for the soul in a way. And there should be clear paths to avoid disillusionment.  \n  \n[but personally I'm more like](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a1/7b/17/a17b170441baef364f80dc92935a2e63.jpg)
1	I don't have any dreams at all. Not in that sense, at least.\n\nI do have like pretty intense dreams in the regular sense of the word.
1	I do this but I call it envisioning my goals lol
3	How aren't you as stereotyped for an ISFP?	
4	[deleted]
3	I don't consider myself intriguing or really charismatic at all until I socialize with someone. When I'm being quiet, nobody would really notice how I act.
2	I hear many isfps go through phases of getting obsessed with a hobby for a period of time. I could paint for 6 hours straight but that's the only thing I have any patience for. For anything else, my attention span is about 30 seconds.
2	Well, I've probably been in an Fi-Ni loop for many years, so I'm extremely clumsy and unaware of my surroundings. (I'm extremely compulsive though, and chronically impatient.)\n\nI'm not physical at all. No sports or activities, no hugs.\n\nWhat's charisma?\n\nI'm conservative. (Although, as a whole it's not fair to assume someone's type by their beliefs and vice versa.)\n\nI don't argue online about my beliefs cause it's pointless. Nobody's gonna change their minds from a stranger screaming in their faces.
1	I get really analytical, cynical, objective, and nit-picky whenever I pick up on bad spelling, bad grammar, blatant hypocrisy, cheap emotional manipulation, petty favoritism, or inconsistent characterization. 
3	Self Care, Self Help	\nFair warning, this ended up being a very long, unnecessary post, and I'm also on my phone, so I apologize for any formatting or spelling errors, I'll try to make this into paragraphs as best I can. I'm also not very good with reddit, I mainly read, not post, so bear with me.\n\nI figured I might want to put a trigger warning, if you are sensitive to mentions of violence, depression, or other things to do with mental health, heads up. I don't go into any kind of explicit detail, but it does very briefly get brought up.\n\nHi guys! What do you all do for self care, stress relief, relaxation, ect? Back when I was a kid (less than 11 years old), I was outdoors in the woods, usually barefoot, all day every day. I climbed trees, explored, all sorts of stuff. I had a trampoline I loved. We had a massive veggie garden I would help tend to, pick veggies, ect. When I was inside, I constantly read books. I started reading Harry Potter, and finished book 6 before I turned 11. I was always creating something, drawing something, painting, coloring, you name it.\n\n A lot of this, however, was to escape the violence in the household I grew up in. However, at least when I was very young, it was simply an integral part of my being. We miles outside of a small town of less than 900 people, "in the sticks". After my mom and stepdad divorced, mom and I moves into said small town, and let's just say wandering town streets and being around so many people just wasn't as interesting as wandering the woods from literally sun up to sun down. I became a house plant. \n\nI got a gameboy one year, and that was my introduction to the old Pokemon games (Leaf Green!). Several more years, and a few more moves in the same town, and I was still a house plant. I tried a weight lifting class, and track and field and volley ball, however due to issues with my knees and shoulders dislocating easily, I had to stop, and became a permanent couch potato after that.\n\n I eventually became extremely depressed, due to various other traumatic life events as well, and after years of antidepressants, anxiety meds, and generally not caring, I gained a lot of weight. I believe initially I gained about 40 to 60 pounds in less than two years in high school. I was still very artsy and creative, excelling in my arts, English and science classes. Over time, life has drained all of the spark out of me. \n\nIt's been 5 or 6 years since I graduated high school. Since my freshman year of high school, nearly ten years ago, I've put on probably close to 100 pounds. I can't get my sparkle back. I don't see the point of drawing, or painting, or making things anymore. It serves no functional purpose, so there's no point. I miss being active and feeling my body move and work for me. I miss getting so absorbed into fantasy books about other worlds, but I don't see the point any longer. What I miss the most however, is nature. I've been on a few hikes in the last few years, even tried to pick up running a few times, but nature just doesn't have that child-like wonder and beauty any more. I no longer feel that passion and excitement. \n\nAll my life consists of (especially the past 6 months after having 2 knee surgeries to help fix injuries from those dislocations) is a couch or chair, Netflix and some random video games. Or scrolling on my phone, reading about others' adventures. I want to travel, I want to see things, see different people, different cultures, different worlds, try different food, learn how to create again, how to live again. I plan on looking into therapy here soon, as I know I probably sound pretty depressed. I've been in and out of therapy and on and off medications for depression, anxiety, Self harm, and suicidal thoughts and actions since I was 8, so This is not new to me, but it is tiring.\n\n This ended up quite a long post, but can any of you relate? What do you guys do for fun? Does such a thing even exist anymore? 
3	Nihilism is dangerous. You need to care more about the world around you and take responsibility, set a goal, work for that. Humans need these things. \n\nOf course this will bring high and lows in your life. But... do you prefer a rollercoaster or a 10h long, linear car ride?\n\nYou can't enjoy free time if all you have is free time. You can't enjoy work time if all you do is working... now that you don't go to school, all you have is free time. That's why you enjoyed things as little, there were rewards, breaks, adventure... in exchange of school work and family problems.\n\nIt's hard coming out the nihilism loop. But it's all worth it. You can LIVE. Not just survive.\n\n
3	If your body feels up to it or after you heal up a bit more, could you take a trip somewhere and cross something off your bucket list? \n\nI was in a slump of nihilism and I broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year and took a solo trip to the Grand Canyon. I hiked that bad boy from rim to river and back in one day by myself. It was something I’ve always wanted to do and it really helped boost me into feeling more control over my happiness and my life. Joy and wonder still don’t come as easily as they used to but it really reminded me how awesome I can be and all the awesome things I can do and see and it helped me set goals, which I am now working towards. \n\nI’m not saying you have to break up with your partner or go anywhere extravagant or really far away. Maybe a trip somewhere close by to see something or do something you’ve never done will remind you how cool and novel the world is and it might encourage you to keeping finding your place in it? \n\nThis is what worked for me. Like you, I had identified what was making me unhappy and things I wanted to change and doing something really hard that I’ve always wanted to do encouraged me to keep going and changing my life into something I’m  more happy with. \n\nAlso the planning of it all was really enjoyable. It was like a short term goal that I had to work out and it was great practice for starting to work out long term goals.\n\nI hope you figure it all out. I think that emptiness and nihilistic feeling is the worst. It’s like a dull ache that isn’t painful enough to put you into an urgent crisis fixing mode. It just slowly drains you and is so exhausting and dissatisfying and you end up just finding ways to cope, rather than change it. I think ISFPs are special and strong and you seem to have a good understanding of yourself and situation so I’m sure you can and will  overcome this dark time and find your spark again. \n\n
1	I can relate and I too rarely do something that is fun anymore. I was also a pretty life embracing kid until it was crushed over the years by family and school and now the same stuff is happening with lots of time spent at home and doing therapy and taking meds. What helped me a lot was EMDR. Since one particular session I finally found some connection to that inner pain and am able to act and do self care, meaning even basic things like eating and exercising a bit. The anxiety dropped comfortably low and even if I spent weeks at home I don't experience anxiety as much as I used to. Still taking meds tho but they never worked THAT good. I also joined a meditation discord server which  reminds me to be mindful and take my needs more seriously. The thing with having fun though is a different story. The meds lowered that even more than it was before and is now barely existing. Can have some fun with friends and alcohol but that is rare. I do believe though that I'm on a good path and my therapist is a very good one and I really see progress here and try to get my life on track. \n\nI wish you all the best, my friend and hope you find the best treatment you need.
1	You had an interest in art at one point, right? Maybe easing back into these old hobbies will help you rediscover/re-experience what you loved about them in the first place. If I can make a suggestion.. make tiny daily sketches and share them on Instagram... There's a thriving art community there which may help. Just remember to include lots of hashtags so your work is discovered :) best wishes!
1	Do ISFPs hate MBTI?	Met (via Tinder) a girl recently and asked her to take the MBTI test: she is ISFP. I told her in return that I am INTJ. After she had read up a little on 16personalities.com, she proceeded to worry that she wasn't what I was looking for, that she was not good enough, and that I was judging her. Of course, as an INTJ, I also think that is probably true but it seemed like an over-reaction! I really appreciate MBTI and the insights it gives me into the workings of other personality types; I guess the categorisation and simplification of people also appeals to me. This is the first ISFP I have uncovered, and I'm wondering if this is a common reaction, or if there is some past issues that are affecting her? 
19	Lol. What I think is silly about MBTI is the over-generalizing questions - people are different. It’s like asking, “Do ISFPs tend to hate mustard?” \n\nDo you know how ridiculous that sounds? \n\nAnyway. I think your curiosity about ISFPs is somewhat condescending, even if it wasn’t meant to be. I understand you’ve never met an ISFP before, but at the end of the day, she’s just another person with different traits. Who cares?\n\nI think she was worried by your reaction (assuming you had one since she noticed something different about you after she took the quiz,) that you were gonna pin her to her answers and view her differently because of what she got. Don’t do that, make your assumptions about her character based on your real-life impressions and experiences with her.\n\nYou shouldn’t be holding an online MBTI quiz’s results to such a high regard that you’d make this girl uncomfortable with how she responded. “Oooooh”, “Wow”, “Interesting”. I get you’re surprised but tone it down. Fascination is weird and a little dehumanizing. 
6	No. In my experience, they don’t seem to hate MBTI, but I can see how it can be a bit nerve-wracking in a dating context. In fact ISFP seem to be the more open among the S-types, to take new theories like this in stride.
5	It sounds like you're taking it a bit too seriously.. I think there are things in life that make people more compatable than the 4 letters they get on a given day. I always type as infj using online quizzes, but I find I relate more to isfp. Get her to take the quiz next week, she could type as something different.\n\nIf you like each other, great :p but Do you think it's wise to let an online quiz determine who you enjoy spending time with? Or do you think that could lead to self sabotage?\n\nSorry for the rant. I don't hate mbti. I actually enjoy reading about it, but I think it's misguided when people mould their life according to their "type".
9	Hm, I personally love MBTI but sensors are often stereotyped as the people who aren't into MBTI.\n\nAs for her reply, I think she's taking it a bit too literally and the descriptions of the types aren't that good anyways.
3	Have you ever read the type descriptions for sensors? They’re clearly written by iNtuitive types and make us sound like full blown retards on paper. You’d be better off pointing her toward real life ISFP examples like Timberlake, Brad Pitt, Britney Spears, etc.
3	Hate to say it but it could have been a cover for not being that interested in you. A convenient out. \n\nAlso i dont think opinion on mbti has anything to do with type. Any type can have any opinion on it. For example my intj thinks mbti is utter bullshit on the (very fair) grounds that its a pseudo science. But i dont go around assuming all intjs hate mbti.\n\nAnd Its kinda awkward to ask someone to take a personality test on tinder tbh...
2	Do both of you a favor and don't date.\n\nIn time, you'll be frustrated as hell at her lacksadaisical attitude, emotional logic, and just plain doing things wrong (from your perspective). And she'll be tired of being told she's not doing things right and rigidity (from her perspective).\n\nMarried to an ENTP for 12 years (divorced) and have dated a few other NT types. For me, it's oil and water. Other people may have different experiences however.  
1	Most people I matched with on there who had interest in mbti was INTJ. I found it hilarious that I seemed to match with the same people. I stay away from INTJ dating situations. They are nightmares fabricated as novelty and then ISFP just gets hurt. I'd recommend looking for someone else. INTJ will never truly understand ISFP and ISFP will never feel deeply connected to INTJ.
12	I hate being an introvert	I'm too sensitive to other people, yet it's impossible to avoid people altogether.  Why can't I just be an insensitive asshole like everyone else? It's impossible to describe how much certain people bug me just by standing there looking at me. I can feel their eyes and it feels disgusting. Creeps. Even if they're just walking past me, or standing. These guys have no idea the kind of energy they're putting off. It is gross, and they are disgusting human beings.\n\nNot speaking about all extraverts, cuz I know some and they can be great, but I hate my sensitivity to certain creepy motherfuckers who are so insensitive to the kind of shitty swamp beings they are.\n\nFuck, I'm sure someone else here can relate? It's a living hell. And I honestly can't even bring myself to talk to these sludge monsters to tell them to fuck off. I feel like I'll be contaminated. \n\nSorry if you think this is a bad post cuz it's "negative" so will get downvoted, as it is on Reddit, but I honestly just want someone to tell me they know how it feels, so I'm not the only one suffering here.\n\nSorry if you're personally offended by this post, I know some have already been offended. And no I don't have any form of psychosis. I just know some creeps who will physically growl at me and follow me with their eyes as I walk by. Their negative intentions are clear to me. Not trying to be a "jerk," cuz retaliating in defense isn't what jerks do.
5	I never liked it either. When I was a kid I had the delusion of thinking I would become an extrovert as an adult. I am almost 30 and nothing changed lol. Fucking sucks
3	Yes.. certain people make my skin crawl.  And, I swear to god that they KNOW it and kind of love it?  love that they have that power over me to make me uncomfortable.  Yeah, I really hate it. 
2	Maybe you should change the aspect of yourself that you change. \n\nThe less time you spend with others the more you will hate, because you will see yourself changing and having fun and only occasionally check to see what others are doing, what they are putting forth. Aka not the whole picture\n\nTldr go outside and talk to somebody. Be nice and they will be aswell
1	Not an ISFP, but I get that feeling sometimes too, and I'm a dude.  On the other hand, I get the feeling some people feel that way about me, and I know I'm not creepy.  Some of the more bold ones will come forth and tell me I'm intimidating but realized I was a big softy after getting to know me.\n\nNot sure how old you are, but maybe it's an overactive and underdeveloped Ni?  Or it also could be that lechers are just attracted to you :)
1	> It's impossible to describe how much certain people bug me just by standing there looking at me. I can feel their eyes and it feels disgusting. Creeps. Even if they're just walking past me, or standing. These guys have no idea the kind of energy they're putting off. It is gross, and they are disgusting human beings.\n\nHoly fuck, I relate so damn hard... I know the exact same feeling so much, it makes me want to cry. I'm actually surprised that there were people out there experiencing "sludge monsters" who just stand and stare at you. The worst is when they come uninvited to your friend group that is usually fun and ruin the mood with their uncannily creepy presence. I wish I could tell them to fuck off so damn hard. Fuck.
1	I feel its an age thing. I used to feel the same and now looking back I'm annoyed i even cared or wasted energy getting worked up over petty shit. The older you get the less you'll care about nobody's.\n\nEdit: just re-read the post. Don't want to come across as insensitive to what you're saying. My partner is probably what you have been describing but some people are just like that, does not mean they are bad people. Currently working to make him more chill haha. 
4	hey wonderful ISFP's! looking for advice on a new ISFP friend	hi lovelies! I made a new friend recently, an ISFP, and I just want some advice on how to handle the friendship and things with them. Nothing bad has happened, but I really like her and don't want to mess up the friendship so I'm looking for advice prior to any problems. \n\nim an ESFP and maybe not the best at maintaining healthy long relationships, but this ISFP is someone really special and I want her to be around for super long.\n\nwe met thru a tutor site- im 17F and needed a math tutor so she, 19F, tutored me maybe once a week for like about two months. At first we only talked about math but after a month we would drift off into conversation about random things, and laughed a lot and basically i enjoyed her company SO much. then eventually i made the decision to drop this math subject for an easier one that would match my career decision (wedding/events planning). I told her I wasn't gunna need tutoring anymore and this was our last lesson- which i was super sad about- but then I was like, Yo how about lets get dinner! \n\nshe seemed hella keen so we got dinner and totally hit it off!! now as an ESFP y'all probably expect me to be super social, but heres the thing- I dont really get along with people that well. I give off that impression bc I hang a lot w people but there's no one I feel really connected to. HOWEVER this ISFP makes me feel a wHOLE sum different kinda way. we click like heck, we get along SO easily and even when we have different opinions and disagree its still easy and non-conflictive. \n\nanyways we've only gotten dinner 1x but during that time we agreed upon going on a road trip together (YAY) and saving up and travelling Europe! isnt that great!!! we're also gunna have a movie night and im gunna teach her how 2 make lasagne in like a week or two. i've forreal never been so excited to hang out with a friend before, but i dont want to scare her off/mess up/be a dumb fuck!\n\ndo you guys have any advice?????? like how do i approach things w her? how often should we hang?? are there certain things i shouldnt do???\n\nalso do you think she likes me (like platonically duh) or do u think she thinks im annoying?  ??  she replies to my texts like a few hours later or maybe 1-2 days later generally but they're always comprehensive, not-short, answers whatever im asking and yes she gives me dates when she is free! she also sends smiley faces! is it just a thing that ISFP's are bad at replying to texts asap? i dont mind but i just get worried bc i highkey textback generally fast.\n\nidk!!! i guess i just want to know\n\n1. what do u think she thinks of me?? \n2. any advice maintaining an ESFP-ISFP friendship. like what should i do to be a good friend and give her space\n3. do u think she likes me ?? ? ? or is she just being nice\n\nanyways thank you!!!! I love you guys from what ive seen. Hope ur all doing well and finding ESFP(or whatever) friends who super duper love you too!\n\nsorry if this was a weird post. i just cant stop thinking about it hahaha
4	Dont be alarmed by the slow response time on the texts - that's just how texting is. As long as you're not messaging constantly you should be fine! It sounds like she wants to hang out with you, and she's doing so, so just keep suggesting events every now and then! \n\nAvoid being judgemental, and do fun things and you're golden. If she didnt want to hang out with you she'd probably just drop off the face of the earth.
2	This may help as a blanket kind of statement on how we are with friendships:\n\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/isfp-friends\n\nJust remember introverts enjoy their alone time as well, we need it to recharge since socializing can really drain us mentally and emotionally. Movie nights are great for this, you're technically socializing but with zero pressure to socialize or be "on" so to speak since you're watching a movie! Also I know I'm terrible at replying to texts or emails, I say to myself "oh I should really respond to this" and then get to responding a few hours or a day later even with family.
2	She probably genuinely likes you. I know only one ESFP and our relationship has a great dynamic. Funny, he’s also not very social. He just expressive and enjoys things like public speaking, teaching etc. \n\nI can’t speak for everyone but I personally am very selective about who I am friends with. And even more selective about who I make long term plans with. So it seems like it’s all positive. \n\nSlow texting is normal, talking all the time is exhausting. Just keep it casual and seems like it’ll be a great friendship over time 😊
1	My God, is this what esfps are?! You seem amazing, I'm sure your friendship is going to be great!
8	being an isfp and constantly having to depend on others	hi everyone! how are you doing? So I’ve always wanted to live on my own and currently I am of age but I do live in a country in which it is not usual at all for you to move out until you’re 24 which I despise. Honestly it makes me cry just thinking about it also it’s not that I don’t like my parents it’s just that I’ve always thrived to be independent and I feel extremely useless and unhappy still having to depend on my parents moreover I go to a uni that is 1:30h away and so I wish I could simply rent a room there but yeah. my question to you guys if you feel or have felt this way too :)
8	Oh yeah I felt that until I did that. I miss my family A LOT. I'm alone, "chasing my dreams". Guess what, reality is disappointing. You have to sacrifice something in order to gain another. I'm desperate to finish my fucking grade and return to home, jesus. \n\nMaybe then I can heal my mind and start freelancing or smth. But I won't go so far from my roots again.
7	i actually moved out of my parents place when i was sixteen and haven't depended on them for anything since. up until i moved out, my dad raised me to be very independent. i learned from a very early age that i couldn't really count on my family for anything. i've always had this tendency to isolate myself from them. they're very dependent on me despite the fact that a lot of them are INTPs. however, because i don't rely on my family for anything, i end up relying on my romantic partners. in my last relationship, it got to the point where our relationship was borderline abusive because this. 
3	I earned a scholarship and moved out 4+ years ago, from South America to Asia; yeah struggle is real but learning to be independent is something worth trying; I see it as learning a new skill, is like learning to play guitar, at first your fingers will hurt maybe even bleed, the sound won't be pretty as expected, but then if you keep pushing, you'll break even and everything will fall in the right place.\nI see myself as a very  sensitive and spiritual person, so I try to rely more in my feelings and how I see thinks should fold up; like I knew the first time I went to uni in my country, I needed to changed my environment, otherwise I would end up not being useful, and not being able to develop myself, to live and enjoy life, and express myself. Hope find this useful
2	Moved out at 18, never moved back. Lived overseas for a while. Loved it. People commenting isfp's are notoriously "dependent". Disagree in the way that I feel the only dependency I want is with a life long partner to be by my side always.\nI love my parents and family to bits, but having to be dependent on them is not on. Only way to remedy is jump into the fog. Its hard. Very hard moving out of home and studying full time. But the life skills you'll gain from doing so are invaluable. Everyone is stronger than they think. 
4	ISFPs are notoriously dependent on others, both romantically and financially. Sorry to burst your bubble.
1	I mean, you're always gonna have to depend on others, unless you're really well off. Reality sux and parents are annoying, but what can you do. Gotta drink one of the poisons. 
11	I made a quick wallpaper for myself, and then realized what a filthy cliche of an ISFP I am :P	
3	Nah, it’s perfect. Now if you substituted “weed” for “tea”, *then* you’d be a filthy stereotype.  Also an accurate one.

33	Random Obsessions & Sleeplessness	Anyone else get randomly obsessed with things or ideas?!\n\nI’m impulsively looking at buying a new car, and I’ve been spending every waking moment that I’m not working or parenting for days researching it non-stop. I stayed up until 4 am this morning 😂\n\nCame home early from a work to nap and I can’t nap! \n\nI dislike these random obsessions, they exhaust me. \n\n*going to meditate now*
12	Yes \n\nI got a dog last week 
8	Wooooow I'm the same way! I get serious tunnel vision. I get these obsessions and then forget about them after a few days. Like I'll spend two hours shopping for the specific nail polish colors I like, add them to the cart, decide to wait a little to buy them until I have the spare cash, and them forget about it. Such is life lol 
5	Wow, i think i have got something simular
6	definetly. for some reason i got obsessed with skateboarding a few months ago. now i skate every freking day. i also have this with bands and music styles... my tastes are always some kind of phase that lasts for a few weeks and then i just add a bit of it to my life after the real obsession is gone. thats the reason i have ska, 90s techno and surf rock in the same spotify playlist. lol
3	Yes! Little projects, big purchases, anticipated conversations, better ways to get places on my bike. It doesn't happen all the time, but I'd say once a month or so I lose most of a night of sleep thinking obsessively about something. 
3	Yes, I'm also nosy as hell... so sometimes I'm up late spying on people online or researching really random shit about places or looking at buying houses in random places.  I really get going on tangents a lot. 
3	I do this shit too. Ive been obsessed with building a tiny house and ive been looking into it all week even though i have no savings lol. Ive decided i do plan to do it some day though!
3	random obsessions are the story of my life so far\n
3	I’m exactly the same way! Actually if I buy something without doing my little research I feel bad and feel like maybe I didn’t make the best purchase 
2	Yes. I started a business with my hobby and am stuck with it
2	That’s a positive result from an obsession! What’s your business? 
2	Same. Even small purchases. I research, compare, and question my final decision about 1000x lol 
2	Yes! I seem to have this often! I’ll get really obsessed with something and immerse myself in it. It really could be anything, from knitting, to a movie like Into The Wild, to a band, even to a “feeling” like the feeling of Christmas. It never lasts long either, until it’s on to the next obsession. My family and close friends sort of just know this about me and see it as a unique little quirk lol
1	That’s a good way to get focused on something, now you have a goal to save for :) 
1	Amen 
8	How do I show support to ISFP?	How do I show support to ISFP? A close person to me is in depression and drug use, and I know that my advices won’t just help magically. \n\nNo idea how to show support and help
13	physical touch
12	Give them a chance to open up to you. Don’t know if I can speak for everyone, but I feel paralyzed when someone asks me about my problems even if I desperately want to tell someone—it takes a LOT of reassurance to get me to reveal something personal.\n\nI’ve also found that telling someone else your problems really helps just because it makes you feel so, so much less alone. And depression, for me, stems from loneliness. \n\nBy noticing your isfp friend is having a hard time and wanting to help, you are already helping him/her! My advice would just be to offer your companionship. Of course, sometimes we all need some room to ourselves, so if your friend isn’t into talking I wouldn’t push it.
6	Let them know that you’re sincerely there for them, but also give them space if they need it. I like to process my feelings/emotions/stressors internally before I express them to others, if I ever do. For me, it takes a very deep friendship or relationship built on a long standing foundation of trust for me to open up about anything.
1	How to know if you/others are ISFPs	Other than doing tests online (are they accurate?), what general characteristics and small details do ISFPs have or do? From online tests, im an ISFP and i do relate to most of the descriptions. However i do not feel im artistic in any way. Cant draw, take nice photos, dance or play any instruments. Please share on how you identify ISFPs!!! So i can confirm i am one and also to identify others irl. Thanks!!
3	I’m not creative in an artsy way, but I do care very much about aesthetics. I love taking pictures, and I love decorating the inside of my house. The artsy part of the ISFP description used to make me question my results, but when you focus on the main functions and how you utilize them you may see that the specific typing of personality types (artsy for us) aren’t going to fit us all. Hopefully this helps :) \n\nI’m still relatively new to this, I’ve seen it explained in detail by some of the folks on here in a more elegant way but I have to learn more. 
1	[deleted]
1	I've noticed that they are (in movies or series) depicted as detectives, policemen, lawyer; anything that involves feelings/principles and Se output; Also being involved/engaged in Se stimulating activities often, clubbing, doing sports, hiking etc
5	Looking for reading material on self construction	I'm an ISFP (almost needless to say? hehe) but I'm certainly not a healthy one! There are some aspects in which I seem super healthy, but in the rest, I'm super unhealthy. There is just no middle ground. \n\nI've been wondering if there are reliable, detailed books or other reading material that'll help me make myself a better person and understand myself in general, at the last. Can you guys help me out? Cheers!\n\nI face issues in these aspects (and more):\n\n- sustaining and committing to my work\n- being empathetic and perceptive of others\n- anything romantic (!)\n- mood swings especially when in a social setting\n- getting past my past (I let things loop infinitely)\n- learning from mistakes: I tend to repeat my faulty behaviour even when I consciously know it's the wrong thing\n- being productive on a daily basis, as in, sustaining and committing to a routine over longer times\n\nThanks a ton in advance, just in case I'm unable to personally thank you in the comments!
3	Aren't some of the things on your list ISFP super-powers?  Committing to routine isn't necessarily a trait of a healthy person, but fully living in the moment is a gift that not everybody has, why not own and embrace it?  If it's daily tasks like chores or work, maybe see the nuances of said tasks and realize that every day is a new day and doing the dishes isn't the same as washing cups.\n\nSelf identify instead of self construct, just be yourself in a way that's beneficial to you :)
2	Not a book, but practicing mindfulness through meditation has helped me stabilize my moods and become an all around better person 
1	Here are the 2 books that helped me a lot with some of the issues you mentioned that I myself struggled with.\n\n\- The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals by Chris McChesney, Jim Huling, and Sean Covey\n\n\- The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey
1	Try reading Think on These Things by Krishnamurti. He talks a lot about the things in your list, and also about keeping things in perspective and being present. \n\nAlso, just remember, doing these things is more important than reading about them. You can know what you need to do, but just knowing solutions won’t help you take a step toward a healthier life. 
114	ISFP Care and Handling User Guide and Manual	**ISFP Care and Handling User Guide and Manual**  \nCongratulations! You’ve managed to coax an ISFP out of their favorite hiding spot! Here’s a handy guide for taking care of and getting to know your quirky and mysterious new friend.\n\n**Your ISFP comes with:**\n\n* Ten unique and interesting clothing items\n* Two sets of worn and comfy clothes\n* One animal friend\n* One collection of inspiring photos and/or random objects that are meaningful to your ISFP.\n* One set of closely held moral beliefs and values\n\nCustom upgrades: Your ISFP will have multiple creative interests. Books, sports equipment, musical instruments, camping gear, cameras, various art supplies, and random junk may also be included.\n\n**Software**Your ISFP comes preprogrammed with the following traits:\n\n**Fi:** Makes your ISFP unit independent and sensitive. They may appear aloof or distant, preferring to process their emotions on their own. They’re actually very warm, loyal, and supportive when you get to know them. Your unit also has a strong moral compass and will refuse to do anything that conflicts with their values. Contrary to popular belief, your ISFP is capable of changing their views, but forget trying to force them into doing it!\n\n**Important note:** Each ISFP will have Fi values, morals, and beliefs that are unique to them. You will need to adapt this general user guide to your specific ISFP Unit.\n\n**Se:** Your ISFP is very in touch with their physical world and enjoys using their five senses to explore and express themselves. They can be impulsive and adventurous, preferring to live in the moment rather than plan too far ahead. Se also makes them witty and charming and surprisingly cute.\n\n**Ni:** Your unit will have the need to search for deeper meaning in their life. They will frequently “have a feeling” about a plan or a person that they will feel compelled to act upon, but not be able to explain. Also makes them incredibly self-critical and may induce occasional bouts of self-doubt.\n\n**Te:** Your unit may have many dreams, but probably won’t get around to actually accomplishing most of them (without help, anyway). They can also be stubborn at the inopportune times and unintentionally (and hilariously) blunt when asked to give their opinion.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n1. Sit your ISFP in a quiet room, preferably near a window.\n2. Set the animal friend in ISFP’s lap.\n3. Leave ISFP alone for several hours to adjust to their surroundings and bond with the animal friend.\n4. Offer ISFP cookies and initiate conversation about the animal friend.\n5. If ISFP doesn’t start, take them to a nearby park and let them wander for a while.\n\n**ModesCinnamon Roll Mode (default):** Soft, sweet, and bashful. Prefers to listen to you talk and observe you quietly. Notices everything and knows your favorite food, what kind of car you drive, and probably where you live even though they never asked. (No, it’s not creepy! They just overheard you giving directions to someone else and didn’t want to bother you needlessly.) Will make you quirky, adorable (and sometimes baffling) gifts to demonstrate their affection.\n\n**Creative Mode (default):** Your ISFP has a nearly unmatched creative brain and will often find beauty in their environment. If you don’t really understand (Yes I’m talking to you NT types) just voice your support and point out one or two things about their art (or song, or sport, or hobby, or project, or handmade gift/peace offering) that you like. Your ISFP will be flattered and happy that you appreciate their talents and are involved.\n\n**Adventure Mode:** Your ISFP unit will live for meaningful adventures, and often express longing for the freedom or ability to try new experiences and visit new cultures or sights. Actual chance of them acting on these desires is 50/50, but your ISFP will spend a lot of time daydreaming about it nonetheless.\n\n**Sensory Recharge Mode:** Your ISFP unit may go dormant after a large social event or adventure. While they enjoy sensory activities, they easily become overstimulated and need time to themselves to process everything they’re taking in. Forget trying to have conversations with your unit while they’re in this mode; they’ll quickly excuse themselves and hide.\n\n**Angry Toddler Mode:** Activated under stress. Your ISFP has become so emotionally overwhelmed (usually due to feeling they are not Good Enough™) that they just can’t handle any more. Symptoms include grouchiness, outright refusal to eat or engage in normal activities, and uncharacteristic outbursts of anger. Gently relieve your ISFP of any pressing responsibilities and give them space to express their feelings without judgement.\n\n**Relationships with Other UnitsNF:** ISFP enjoys relationships with NF types, drawn to their emotional depth and idealism. In friendships with these types, ISFP is free to discuss creative ideas and dream big. ISFP will also go to these types for emotional support in times of need.\n\n**NT:** Your ISFP may not initially gravitate towards NT individuals, as they often don’t understand their rational nature. However, they are intrigued by the intellect and personality quirks of NT types.\n\n**SJ:** Your ISFP will want to ride through the glen on their mighty steed, firing arrows into the sunset while the SJ in question will probably want them to calm down, organize, and behave themselves. If not handled carefully, this can result in conflicting goals and thus, stressful relationships.\n\n**SP**: Your ISFP unit will be most at ease with fellow SPs. They can go on spontaneous adventures together and your ISFP unit is guaranteed to have a couple in their social circle. (Also the #1 culprit when your ISFP randomly disappears.)\n\n**Feeding**Your ISFP unit will have an unusual diet and eating schedule. Mealtimes and snacks tend to happen when ISFP finds it convenient. Don’t worry about regular meals, your ISFP likes and appreciates food and will make sure that they are eating when they need it.\n\n**Grooming**ISFP is very particular about their appearance. When it comes to hygiene, they tend to stick to the basics, but can be relied upon to take care of themselves. However, If you want them to be on time for something important, remind them to prepare beforehand​.\n\n**Sleeping**Your ISFP will flip-flop between intensely creative periods where they will forego sleep to work on projects (or go adventuring), and “catch-up” periods where they will sleep through the day to recharge. Don’t interrupt your unit’s sleep times, as this may activate Angry Toddler Mode.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions*****My ISFP won’t activate (talk), now what??***\n\nStop trying so hard! You can’t force an ISFP to be your friend. Chances are excellent that ISFP picked up on your efforts to connect from the beginning and is well aware of your intentions. Give them time to observe you and gently coax them out with non-aggressive, non-threatening communication (or fun. Or cookies. Or compliments. Or kittens).\n\nAlso, keep in mind that silence isn’t necessarily an indicator that your ISFP doesn’t like you. Often it just means that they’re thinking; either processing what you have to say or coming up with something to contribute the conversation. Look for these signs instead: does your ISFP go out of their way to spend time with you or do things for you? Do they make eye contact when you’re talking? If so, they like you.\n\n***How do I know if my ISFP is doing okay emotionally?***\n\nAsk them. They rarely open voluntarily, as they don’t want to be a bother. Keep in mind that it may take some time before they’ll be comfortable sharing with you. When they do talk, listen and validate their feelings. Avoid jumping in and attempting to fix their problems for them or giving your own opinion too quickly. Your ISFP will keep their mouth shut rather than risk subjecting their precious thoughts to unsolicited criticism.\n\n***My ISFP has disappeared, help!***\n\nRelax. ISFPs are prone to going AWOL without warning. This doesn’t mean that they’re in trouble. They will probably reappear within a day or two with an interesting story about how they went on a last minute road trip with friends and met a eccentric biologist who studies Bigfoot in Tennessee. Resist the urge to check on them too frequently. This will lead to more disappearances (your ISFP is trying to escape from you). If you’re really worried, casually invite them to get food or do something fun.
24	Thank you for making this post! It's very whimsical but informative to help others understand the ISFP type. I'm glad to have you and your contribution in this subreddit. 
12	This is great! Everything is spot on! Sadly I lose most of my sentimental random objects, so the closest thing I have is a playlist of music that changed my life. 
11	I'm giving this to every new person I meet from now on lol 
9	This is amazing and should be a living document that our sub can add to. \n\nAngry toddler mode is so spot in - fact I usually know when I'm in it and can't snap myself out!
6	Thank you for sharing this! This is all me, and I love that it is slightly humorous by being set up like an owners manual haha
6	I feel condescended to...yet this is accurate. 
3	I finally know my type x\_x
38	ISFPs are my favorite personality type	You guys are so effortlessly fascinating and amazing at everything that you focus on doing. Just keep being you.
20	Wait wait wait... a compliment? *system won't compute*
17	ENFP here and I totally agree
8	Awwwww

4	omg thank you so much 😊 have a good dayy
4	I find that a little weird, but thanks.
24	Happy to be here (Switched over from ISTP)	Hey y'all,\n\nAfter thinking I was an ISTP for a long time, I've finally come to the conclusion that I'm actually an ISFP.\n\nAfter I got diagnosed with Aspergers last week, I wanted to revisit all the types because now I knew some of my traits are actually because of my Aspergers and not because of my personality. And after doing more research, ISFP just made sense to me, more so than ISTP.\n\n  \nJust wanted to say I'm happy to be here!
1	Where do you like to shop?	I like Etsy. Currently browsing [society6.com](https://society6.com) \n\nAntique stores/thrift stores are nice but they take a lot of energy
1	Thrift shops for actual shopping but i like window shopping in any stores.
14	I'm a nervous INFP who likes you guys	Hi ISFPs. This is my first reddit post, and it is because I have reached a miniature revelation that makes me nervous. I know that this may sound silly, but I have found that every man I've ever had a serious crush on happens to be an ISFP. I wish that I could calm my heart, but I don't know what to do. These feelings keep plaguing me! My idealizations of a meaningful future with someone always turn into thoughts of some ISFP. These musings feel heavy on my chest, and it is with embarrassingly high disappointment that I read about how incompatible many people seem to think we are--INFPs and ISFPs. It feels a bit ugly of me. I feel like some sorta perverse and sweaty weirdo to have the thought of an MBTI type make my heart race... I just find you guys so mysterious and alluring! When I think of having a pleasant conversation with an ISFP, I feel vulnerable, like the butterflies inside me are pulling my strength away. You are all just so talented and cool!! I would love to bond with someone who is so similar yet so different to what I am familiar with. I want to learn one-on-one how you all see the world...I want to learn more about you... Maybe this isn't so bad, but I'm unsure. I know some other types that tend to find me interesting, but I can't definitely say that I've interacted with any ISFPs. I'm quite afraid that they will find me insufferably boring. I really am sorry if I sound like a huge ole creep right now. I don't know what else to say...Please, is there any advice for this sort of thing? Sorry if I sound strange in the bad way, and thank you for reading my post!
10	Lol a lot of my best friends are INxPs :). Tbh, people tend to see me as kind of mysterious and many people have told me that I’m kind of hard to get to know, but honestly, it’s not like I have some brooding secret, I just live in my head and kind of forget to talk instead of just observing sometimes. I will say, I definitely am kind of hard to get to know. I’ll randomly be outgoing sometimes, especially if I’m around other friends, but I’m always intimidated by people who are really extroverted or who seem cool to me. I think a lot of ISFPs, aside from naturally being private and independent, also tend to have kind of low self esteem and might be kind of shy (although, this of course does not apply to all ISFPs). But I just think it might be kind of helpful to remember this, and to realize that with ISFPs, you might have to kind of put in a lot of the leg work initially until they are comfortable around you, but if you can find a common interest or something, conversations will probably be a LOT easier. But good luck :). I absolutely love INFPs, so I’m sure the ISFPs in your life would probably love to get to know you :).
3	You shouldn’t be ashamed of these feelings :). I believe that all types can get along in some way, personal experiences can cause some people to be attracted unexpectedly to certain types for different reasons.\nMy absolute best friend is an INFP, we grew up together and we get along great, but all the turbulent moments in our relationship resulted from my inability to express my feelings in the immediate moment, causing for some hurtful misunderstandings and passive aggressiveness on my end (ISFPs are known for being bad at verbally expressing their thoughts and feelings, they prefer to express through actions). There was also some difficulty in finding things we could do that we would both equally enjoy (an activity that I would enjoy would often tire him and vice versa), but I still find his company both enjoyable and comforting; he’s one of the few people I can truly and completely be myself with, and I appreciate him a lot for that. An INFPs greatest gift to an ISFP is their natural ability to understand their emotions; ISFPs don’t really understand why they feel the way that they do, they just do. This pairing can very much work in my experience, as long as enough time is given to overcome said obstacles :).\nA very beautiful example of this dynamic would be Zuko (ISFP) and Iroh (INFP) from Avatar the Last Airbender.
59	I really appreciate this sub	We're the most unpretentious mbti sub by far. I know we're small but i actually dont mind it that way. Isfps are just the chillest.  Kudos to us.
7	Luv u 2 homie <3
8	I'm an ISFP and made BunnyCat, a music album. Hope your guys like it!	
5	Can someone explain the sensing aspect of ISFP to me?	Or maybe just an example, I don't care.
10	Well it's extroverted sensation so its wanting to go out into the world and experience things, touch things, be totally present in whatever is going on around you. Coupled with the Fi it can help us refine who we are, what matters to us, who we care about, etc. If you avoid it and rely on Ni too much (lock yourself away from the world), you can end up being paranoid, telling yourself stories that don't reflect reality, etc.
7	It makes me very conscious of the cleanliness of my home. Some clutter is fine, but actual mess like a dirty kitchen will make me stressed and depressed very quickly. Luckily that also means a clean and nice smelling home will lift me up easier than pretty much anything. 
5	I think it goes hand in hand with the perceiving trait. Like noticing the subtleties of body language and facial expression to gain insight on how someone is feeling or what they’re thinking. 
2	sort of just observing your surroundings. basically but im sure others can give better examples
3	Experience dating an INFJ	What's your experience dating an INFJ? I'm an ISFP and I've dated a few. 
7	I’ve dated one. Now she’s my wife. You could say dating her went well :)
48	relatable	
6	I too relate 🥰🥰 lol how adorable ☺️  I did this, this morning 
9	Man this is so gay but I actually do relate.
2	What's this from?
8	Do you have a secure, avoidant or anxious attachment style?	I am definitely a strong anxious type. Unfortunately my relationships have been mostly with avoidant types as they are attracted but obviously quite difficult to have together. School of life on YouTube has some great information on attachment style. 
3	[deleted]
3	Definitely avoidant. I'm not even able to have some sort of romantic relationship. One month was the longest and now I don't even bother
2	FOR SURE anxious. I’ve found myself a nice boy with a secure attachment style though. Our relationship has done wonders for me.
1	Used to be very secure, but after taken some SERIOUS L's over the years I'm avoidant/anxious. 
1	anxious avoidant. I really hate it.
1	I relate more to the Anxious-Ambivalent attachment style
1	Avoidant.
1	i don't like the school of life yt channel.\n\nthey sell cheap philosophies.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Curious, how have the anxious-avoidant types reacted to being asked on a date?  Have you ever been so afraid that you react like you do during a jump-scare scene in a scary movie?
3	Is it weird that I [22F] love classic and hard rock music, being an ISFP?	I read on the 16Personalities page that ISFPs tend to be less traditional and enjoy more modern, innovative music. I grew up with rock music from the 70s and 80s and I love it, but hate a lot of music from the 21st century. 
12	It shouldn't even matter to you if its weird or not
8	Eh, a shitton of people love that, nothing weird or special about it. \n\nBut then again, who cares.
7	Us artists like what we want
3	Very normal id say.
2	I'd say it's pretty normal lol - isfp here
2	Im listening to goth rock from the 80's now and hate anything popy, i mostly listen to extreme metal or alt rock
1	[deleted]
1	I don’t know about classical music. Electro-orchestral music, like World’s End Girlfriend sounds godly to me. Hmm. Listening to hard rock comes as no surprise. Metalheads usually listen a ton of different genres and artists. I mostly dig it for the bass and distortion. 
1	Nope! I prefer classic rock to most music being made today
1	My music taste is almost entirely influenced by the experiences attached to it. I have favourites from most genres but I've had a variety of exposure
43	Does anybody else get really upset when they feel ignored?	I'm not sure how relevant this is to ISFP but I've recently realized being ignored is the quickest way to make me inappropriately angry. Seems strange considering I don't usually want to stand out too much, but when I do put myself out there I want to be acknowledged.
27	Yup.\nAnd hate being talked over. If I'm bothering to say something... Then listen!
14	I mostly feel sad, like I'm not really important to people. But yeah, when I'm confident about myself and they do that I get angry.
4	This is totally an isfp thing. Anyone got some good tips? Why does it even happen?\n\nMy boss noticed one time and asked me to continue my story once when some asshole interrupted. That was nice. 
2	I only get upset when I get interrupted. I dont care too much if people dont come talk to me, but when I'm talking to someone and they just talk over me, it fricking ticks me off. I already dont talk a whole lot in the first place, so when I do and still get ignored is one of my biggest pet peeves. I do my very best to listen to people fully and I rarely interrupt because I know how rude it is. 
2	the thing i hate the most is when i'm talking something and i'm in the middle of a train of thought and the person that is listening starts talking over or loses attention
1	I’ve been noticing this a lot more lately :/\n\nI think it’s definitely an ISFP thing.
26	PSA: being a dishwasher at a small restaurant is a great introvert job	I just started dishwashing out of desperation to get money and damn so far its surprisingly one of the best jobs ive had.\n\nBest things about it:\n\n- seclusion!!! You get your own room to wash dishes alone and you can play music the whole time. I cant wait to download some audiobooks to listen to.\n\n- easy. Its simple. All you do is wash stuff for 6 hours, take out trash, then you leave. No multitasking. No dealing with the public!! I find the time flys by.\n\n- people leave you alone for the most part. Just wash the dishes and youre fine. No drama. No stress. Great if youre socially anxious.\n\n- Pay. The pay varies from place to place but its usually better than minimum wage. Im getting $10.50/hr which is not amazing but its the most I've made so far.\n\n- free food. Im sure this varies from place to place too but i get 1 free meal per shift and the foods amazing.\n\nAnyway yeah. If youre looking for introvert jobs i recommend dishwashing at a small restaurant. If you dont mind the physically taxing aspect of it. Personally ill take physically taxing work over mentally or emotionally taxing work any day. Anyway im NEVER going back to serving after this.
5	Hahaha, oh my god. This is crazy.\n\nI was a minimum wage dishwasher and busser at a pizza place in Seattle at the end of 2016, and I consider it one of the best, easiest, and most rewarding jobs I ever had. \n\nThe waiters would socialize with me sometimes to rant about silly customers as they dropped off their trays at my station (which was always funny), and I’d get to overhear the kitchen staff joking around with each other (who was also always funny). \n\nOutside of that, I didn’t have to socialize much and I found doing the dishes through the machine therapeutic.\n\nHm. I’m out of a job right now and I might consider finding another dishwashing job after this post, hahaha.\n\n(My end goal is to continue as a freelance photographer with some online passive side income, but for now I could use the money.) 
1	That’s finding happiness in where you’re at my friend. I hope it stays enjoyable for you. Often I wish I had a low key job with minimal stress 
1	I’ve done dish washing a bunch. I found my Se really helped. I could quickly organize and arrange the dishes, faster than others. One problem was I didn’t like the smells.
1	That is awesome :)
1	Yay
2	I made a subreddit for MBTI enthusiasts who make music. Please come and share your OC!	/r/MBTImusicians\n\n\n7 different people have already posted songs they've made. You should, too! :)
1	Feel free to check mine out, especially if you live in a different country. It shows different country's flags under my profile's stats and I am measuring my success based on how many flags I can collect :) Sort of like collecting Pokemon :P\n\n* [INTP [Classical](1:00)](https://soundcloud.com/user-216205579/track-1)
3	How do you use Fe?	Personally I kinda use it like a shield function, I'm pretty good at reading the atmosphere and making sure I don't say the wrong thing, but I only really do that so I don't trigger people, get them turned at me and get screamed at. Outside of that, I heavily empathize with and care for the people I like (although that may be Fi, not Fe).
3	Fe is the social harmony function. It values what the group wants over the user’s needs. I use it when I have to take care of people, when I need to be polite, and when I need to put my problems and desires aside for the sake of the group. I also use it to cut away at my individualality to fit in better. \n\nAlso, in regards to empathy, both Fe and Fi are capable, but Fe is definitely more capable because it is about understanding *others* emotions/it absorbs the emotional atmosphere from the outside (this is why XXTJs are terrible at dealing with others emotions because they have almost zero understanding of emotions that are not their own).
3	Famous ISFP musicians	Here's some musicians that (I think) are ISFPs:\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nChris Cornell (Soundgarden)\n\nBob Dylan\n\nEric Clapton\n\nEminem\n\nArt Garfunkel\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nJanis Joplin\n\nLil Wayne\n\nPrince\n\nRihanna\n\nEddie Vedder (Pearl Jam)\n\nLayne Staley (Alice In Chains)\n\nKanye West\n\nNeil Young
7	Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Kayne West
4	Lana del Rey
3	Rihanna isn’t an extrovert? What??
2	Wow I like a lot of these.
2	Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse I believe?
1	This is just a theory, but is Lacey Sturm an ISFP?
1	Kanye West is an enfp 6w7
1	Yung Lean, Ruby Da Cherry and $crim from $uicideboy$, Lil Peep
1	Lil Peep, Paul McCartney, Kurt Cobain...
15	Are you (ISFP) awkward at giving erotic descriptions but do you enjoy them yourself?	I love it when my partners give me "stories" in bed/tell me what they will do/describe what they are feeling. However, I tend to be more methodical and smiley in bed and knowing what to say + making myself say the sexy words is a stretch. Is this common for everyone, regardless of MBTI, or do you feel this way too?
11	I know exactly what you mean. 
4	I can say sexy stuff if im super horny but if im not then i just cross my fingers and hope i turn them on. \n\nWhen it comes to being ~sexy~ i let my sense of touch do all the talking.
2	This is scarily on the nose, yes.
1	Not sure it does anything for me to hear it. When I'm drunk though, I talk dirty. It took a couple years but my partner likes it and I like to see him get excited. 
11	Anyone else not like anime?	No hate directed towards anyone that does, I'm just wondering if anyone else doesn't. I can't get behind it no matter how hard I try and it seems to be something commonly associated with our type lol. 
10	Yea fuck anime
6	Personally I love it more than anything else in the world, but I've actually noticed that many xSFPs don't like it. \n\nWhat exactly don't you like about it?
5	I'm not a fan of anime to be honest. The only one I like is the Pokemon series which I used to watch as a kid.
5	I hate it, and the fucking poor excuses of humans that are weebs
3	Lol I love the shit but it's hard to find good anime to watch after you've watched a shit load of it. Every time I pick up a new one it's just bad. Give me some recommendations. 
3	I'm more partial to anime movies. Akira, Paprika, My Neighbor the Yamadas, Spirited Away, etc. Probably because I don't have the time or energy to invest in the billion anime shoes out there. I'll watch my 2 hour movie and be done with it, thanks very much.
2	Well, in my case I love it. :) 
2	Nope. I watched DBZ religiously as a kid, does that count?
2	I like anime but it does get annoying reading it so I only watch a little bit at a time 😕
2	Can't stand it, especially because most of them are sexualized as fuck and I want nothing with that.
1	There are a lot of animes I like, but the anime industry as it is currently right now is a bit... meh. Not a huge fan of many animes being made. (Way too much fanservice, generic characters and tropes being used a lot...)\n\nBut, as other commenters have said, I can greatly appreciate a unique, colorful and creative art style + bgm (edit: and a good story).
1	The only ones I could ever get into are the mainstreams ones (sailor moon, inuyasha, full metal alchemist) and the Hayao Miyazaki movies..but I just can’t get into any other ones. I like their aesthetic, but that’s it.
1	I really like some, but the anime community is horrible, and I hate them. 
1	I loveeeee me some dark/horror/sci fi anime 
1	Can’t stand it.
1	well don't try to like something. Look, it's supposed that Fi doms are kinda Hippies, but I fucking hate hippies and all that shitty "smoking pot" fuckshit.  so don't feel bad if you don't fit in the anime club. So, if fucking anime is what makes you happy, fuck anime. I like anime a little. I don't like almost any anime serie, but the manga drawing style has a good level of realism/description being very simple and fast to draw. And I like to draw because it's just a way to express myself or imagined situations. Nice to meet you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfuck hippies.
18	What I imagine another isfp would look like on the streets	
6	glad you said another and not every, that’s definitely not the style for me lol 
2	Naaah
2	This is what I imagine INFPs look like

4	Anyone with experience dating a Te dom?	Particularly with an ENTJ. That's what I'm thinking my bf is, I find it more challenging to type someone you're dating somehow lol. Also I don't know very many to do a comparison. \n\nCurious if anyone had a relationship with one or still are, and how it worked out? 
2	I've been best friends with h once since the age of 5\nWe're both about to be 21 now\nRoommates and everything\n\nAs long as there's a mutual respect for each other it's pretty cash 
1	I was just in a relationship with one for a year, and let me tell you it wasn't too healthy for me. I'm very easy going and he hates doing what other people want to do, so I ended up compromising on everything. I hate influencing other peoples actions, so I wait until I'm right at my breaking point before asserting what I want/need, and even then he'd always respond with "nah dont feel like it sorry." He had no empathy. I love to go out and go on adventures, and he loves to stay home, so we only went out a handful of times. On the rare occasion that we'd go do something I wanted to do, he'd spend the next few weeks reminding me of how generous he was for doing that for me, and how much energy/time/money it took from him which made me feel like a burden. He sapped my energy and gave so little back. He never expressed much affection and I need affirmation. He liked to play hard to get and I withdraw when someone seems like they aren't into me. Needless to say I'm not recommending this situation. Your boyfriend might be different, mine was unusually self-centred. I like to think not all ENTJs are like him.
9	What are things you do that are atypical of an ISFP (or at least a stereotypical one)?	* I spend most of my time indoors, behind my PC. I find going outside more of a necessary evil than a pleasure. I'm pretty lazy overall and prefer just sitting and lying around and being comfortable. \n\n* I'm very jaded with lots of things, I'm very hard to impress. "Look at this mountain, it's so huge!" ..yeah, so what? \n\n* I don't do self reflection. \n\n* I really hate talking "typical sensor things" like small talk, what the neighbors did last weekend, etc.\n\n* I talk a lot when around people I'm close with. \n\n* I come up with some what if situations here and there, and think about them in my head. Not to the extent of an INFP, though.
3	I'm not athletic and I'm terrible at drawing, painting, and crafts.\n\nAnd I avoid internet arguments and RL arguments alike like the plague.
3	>I spend most of my time indoors, \n\nThat's the I.\n\n>"typical sensor things" like small talk\n\nThat's not sensor things. Sensor things are practical, reality kind of things. The Fi makes us want them to have relevance for our lives in particular.\n\n>I talk a lot when around people I'm close with\n\nAlso an introvert thing. Vs extrovert who would just tend to talk a lot.\n\n\n>I don't do self reflection. \n\nThis is the only one that is weird. Cause you cant Fi without self reflection. Unless it just comes so naturally you don't even realize it.
2	If your spending your whole life indoors jaded behind a computer does it even matter what your personality is? What's even life at that point?
1	-I hate confrontation and will avoid it in any kind of way !\n-I Hate crowds- they give me anxiety \n-BIG daydreamer\n-Chill mellow & laidback all the time. \n-I procrastinate a lot - not as much as before because I’ve been working on willpower but yeah I procrastinate some lol\n- I really like/love kind people. When I see someone who’s naturally kind & sweet I think wow 😮 this persons beautiful I wish I can be more like them , more graceful 🙂 \n- I’m VERY sensitive. I can’t take criticism 😕 I know that’s bad but even if I try I still get my feelings hurt 😔 \nI’m very hard to get to know If want to be hard to get to know , you know ?? \nI draw clothes to design- I want to be a fashion designer one day so I guess that makes me a artist - & I do love doing fun art projects for kids even though I’m not one 😊 \nI love my and appreciate my home . I still live at home but I daydream about how comfortable I’m gonna make my apartment when I do move out.\nThat’s it I think 😊\n\n
1	Not artsy, and can't bear to listen to people going on about their values.
0	You must be an INTP
8	Anyone else have trouble with extroverts in general?	At first I was like "the only extroverts I don't get along with are ENTPs", but a few days ago I've been looking more into ENTJs and I realize they aren't exactly my friends, either. I think one of the most mentally abusive teachers I've ever had was one (or an ESTJ, but I lean more towards ENTJ).\n\nAfter that, I also realized I've had bad experiences with ESTJs, ESFJs, ESTPs and ESFPs. Well, that leaves out ENFPs (who tend to be very draining to hang out with) and ENFJs (who I find alright but wouldn't really have a deep friendship with).\n\nThen I also realized literally almost all of my good friends and family members I'm close with are introverts. I only have one ESFP friend, but I don't really see him anymore.\n\nIt also occurred to me that most people I dislike in fiction are extroverts as well (ExTx villains mostly).\n\nAnd I don't mean to shit all over extroverts because there are plenty of good ones as well, but overall I just get along with introverts much better.
8	I’ve said this before, but you sound exactly like me.\n\nRegarding ENTJs, I’ve had amazing luck with them as friends and family members but dating them never went well because they don’t trust their own feelings, let alone anyone else’s. All the ones I knew/know end up with a mate that “looks good on paper” while the ENTJ cheats and spends their time looking for love elsewhere.\n\nLike romantic relationships are just another business contract for a lot of them, which is offensive af to an ISFP.\n\nAnd I wouldn’t say I have trouble with all extroverts but I don’t like Fe doms and I don’t really care for SJs either (unless it’s ISTJ) so that pretty much means the only extroverts I tolerate are ESxPs and ENFPs.\n\nBut man I love ENFPs.
4	Some of my best friends are ENFJ/ENFP. As an introvert, I like people that bring me out of my comfort zone. But I do get exhausted with too much interaction with them lol 
3	Are you even sure you are ISFP?
37	Anyone else extraordinarily untalkative?	It doesn't matter with who I am, or what the topic is, there have been very few people in my life that I've actually managed to have good conversations with. And most of them have been online, with different types. In real life it's like I'm mostly geared towards listening, and it's very hard for me to change that. I usually never talk about what's going on with my life even if it was something important, unless someone asked. I also love my INxx friends but lately I've been feeling quite invisible around them as well. Is it an ISFP thing to be very mentally detached from other people? It's like I need to be in my surroundings 24/7. I'm wondering if anyone else could relate.
14	I relate very strongly to this. Working extremely social jobs has helped turn it around but it is very hard for me to make conversation or stand out at all. As I get older I don't care quite as much about it since I've already found my people and a good place in life, but in my early 20s it was a massive source of insecurity. Get good at getting people to talk about themselves, be kind and friendly, then it won't be such a big deal. 
12	I relate to this so much it's stupid. Even when it comes to things I'm really passionate about, I only have a few words to say. It makes me come off as really boring and detached (which, in fairness, I might be). I'm not sure how to deal with it other than to just distance myself from conversation and stay engaged in my surroundings, but I'm not sure if that's the best strategy 
8	This is me to a tee. I don’t have a lot of friends that I can have a conversation with. More often than not, I feel like people don’t care about what I say and I end up getting steamrolled as soon as I want to say something then I never get to contribute to that conversation. I really do feel invisible all the time. 
4	Hmmm there are moments when I appear “shy”, but I’m basically not shy, just uninterested in talking to certain people. I usually try not to talk if I don’t have anything of value to say, but also do a fine job of appearing sociable if I want to. But lately I’ve been choosing to stay quiet around people since it’s been saving me energy. 
4	Yep.... this is hard since I’m a teacher, but I just say what’s necessary and then shut up. I feel like anything said that’s more than what’s essential, is just ignored. I always feel like I’m boring or people zone out when I talk too much, so I just keep it brief. 
3	Oh my gosh yes. I'm [22F] only sort of talkative when I have to be, and even then its feels super awkward. \n\nFor some reason I feel it's easier to talk to strangers or people I dont know well and strike up a great conversation than to those I know better as long as they initiated the conversation. I avoid striking up conversations with people I dont know well unless I have to. \n\nI sometimes even go out of my way to not talk to some people. Not even for any good reason, either. One person I can think of has this very tender and overly sweet personality, and for some reason I can't stand it, and I will literally pretend to be occupied and avoid eye contact with said person so they won't talk to me. I also often sit alone to eat, by choice. It's nice to be alone, completely stress-free. \n\nIt takes me awhile to warm up to people. If I dont particularly like them, I won't spend my time with them. If I like what I see, I'll keep coming back to hang around them and their peers. I have a study group at school consisting if 6-8 people who sit in a designated place on campus. I started hanging around them the beginning of my sophomore year because I had a friend from my freshman year there and it took me all year to warm up to most of them. Even still I still feel awkward around some of them. \n\nI hate when I cant think of anything to say around people who come sit by me. I feel like I should at least act like I'm interested in them, but I have no clue what to say and I dont feel like making an effort. Then I feel like a jerk but I dont know what to do. \n\nAround people I know well I'm not like this. I do socialize, but it's not frequently. I don't party or go out much, and I like to do things by myself a lot. I hate depending on people if I don't have to. 
3	Is this real? Is this why the girl I’m seeing keeps killing the conversation?
2	YES! Conversation is exhausting for me. One of my best friends is in town right now (ENFP) and he talks nonstop. I love him and I’m usually more open with him than anyone but I’m exhausted. I dread casual conversations without the influence of alcohol 😂😭
2	Depends. When around people I don't know or don't like I'm pretty much always silent (except when they ask me something or talk to me, but I keep my responses short and to the point).\n\nAround people I know and like, though? I'm almost an extrovert sometimes.
1	Yep I relate 100%. It’s not that I don’t like talking, I love talking/listening to other people talk about their interests and problems. I just never have the desire to bring up my own interests or problems to other people unless asked about them. 
1	The only place i ever have anything to say is on reddit :[ im so silent in real life. Sometimes ill say stuff in my head but it wont make it out of my mouth. Most of the time i just dont have anything to say at all tho Dx
1	Words are totally overrated. Don't worry about it
3	What enneagram types do you get along with best and worst?	I generally like types 1, 4 and 9 the most.\n\n2 is nice as well but I don't really understand them, and I don't need to be around them that much. Don't really know about 5 or 6, but they seem fine. 7 is *very* hit or miss.\n\nI don't like 3 and 8.
37	It sometimes weirds me out when an acquaintance calls me by name. It's like "wait, you can see me?".	
19	And alternatively, when an acquaintance in a crowded room starts talking to me, I’m always like, “wait, you’re talking to *me?*” 
11	Bro idk why, but this subreddit just describes me to a T.
7	I don't have that thought necessarily but it does weird me out when I hear my name out loud. I don't even like saying it myself.\n\nI just thought it was one of my weird anxiety things lol
6	Maybe I’m a fucking introvert afterall
4	More like, “wait you can see me?? Because I sure as shit never noticed *you*...” \n\nFi doms in our own worlddddd
2	that and when they hug me???? like why???
12	How do you force yourself to finish your work?	I'm currently in my exams and I procrastinate all the time, I feel like I'm dying inside when I'm working on it. \n\nHonestly at this point I'd rather be punched in the face by a gorilla than work on my exams.
12	It’s corny to say, but the only thing that has ever motivated me (besides drugs) is love. Loving what I do, or being inspired by someone I care about, or being moved to do something for someone I love, etc.\n\nOtherwise I feel like my mind fights against whatever I’m “forcing” myself to do, telling me it’s *pointless/inauthentic/boring* etc.
10	Isolate yourself. No phone, no pc, no people, no nothing. Just you, your studying material and your dissappointment voice in your head.
4	Bruh, I'm in the same situation, I tell you... \n\nwhen I REALLY want to work on things, I go somewhere else than my room with my laptop and stay there for hours on end. Working on projects also doesn't usually go well if I have a lot on my mind for some reason.
2	I used to lock myself in my room and play games and draw until I wanted to leave my room - then I'd just rush the work as fast as possible so I could get out of my room.\n\nYou said you feel like you're dying inside while working on it... is this school or something you actually chose to do? If it's compulsory school stuff, have you looked into any alternatives (unschooling, homeschooling, online school, etc)?
2	Set timers and rewards for yourself.  1hr of work. 5-10 minute break.  Timers for both at least until you get in a rhythm. Get away from technology/email/social media at all costs.
1	Get off your routine. You will then see new possibilities\n\nFor me it's tech and energy drinks, for others it's going to be different.
1	Try the pomodoro method along with positive reinforcement. Have a treat system in place, and treat yo' self when you reach a goal or study for a set amount of time. It can be anything - concert tickets, a movie, hell, even some nice chocolates and a cup of tea. Set a timer for fifteen minutes, study solidly for those fifteen minutes. Take a ten minute break, look over your notes for another five. And then repeat the cycle over again. It helps stop you from feeling like you're spending too much time on studying. 
1	I have to sleep a whole day then I get fired up and can work all night
1	go out somewhere like a coffee shop or a library and work. go to, preferably, the library since it limits distraction. this will ensure that your brain doesn't think it's play or sleep time, since, due to the primacy effect, it tends to do that in the same places that you play or sleep. you would not believe the amount of grind time I've gotten in at places that aren't my room. good luck with your exams by the way! 
1	Make it enjoyable. Take it as you time. Make some tea or coffee, put some music on, light a nice smelling candle or incense  and just slowly start working on it. Think about how good it’ll feel once you’re done lol 
1	i used to put my own spin on things i was anxious about. i'd write a silly story or something about the subject.  \nit took the power away from it, and gave it to me  \n  \ni'd go from internal dialogue like, "*why bother? you'll never get it. you're just going to fuck it up. everyone'll see you for the moron you are*."   \n===To, just calmly getting on with it.
1	Might already be too late for you now but in the future I would suggest spreading the work out for weeks/months and just do a little bit everyday. Sooner or later it’ll become a habit and going through them will become easier.  
1	Adderall and deadlines. Those are the only 2 things that can make me get my work done. Unless I have the adderall to make me enjoy working or I have a deadline soon approaching I cannot work efficiently at all. Without either of those things I can work, just no where near as efficiently. 
1	Have you guys ever been tested for ADHD?
1	I just started a post bacc program (to finish the classes I need to apply to med school) and I HAVE to find a quiet place, set a timer and focus for an hour at a time when I study. I put my phone on do not disturb and remove all distractions until I'm done. 
6	How self confident are you? Are you more of an optimist or a pessimist?	Idk, I was just thinking about stuff. I’ve never really been super confident, but I think I mask it pretty well, and can even seem outgoing and bubbly at times. I don’t really complain to others often, but I think at my core I’m pretty negative about stuff, my life especially. What about y’all? How self confident are you? How do others seem to perceive your energy? Etc
10	On a scale from 0 to 10 my self confidence is probably -10.
9	Oh yeah. I'm shy, awkward, trip over my words all the time, very self deprecating with a huge case of imposter syndrome. But when it comes to it, I can absolutely act confident. Like in job interviews or giving presentations. I can blag those things really easily. Which probably contributes massively to the imposter syndrome. \n\nI guess others can perceive me as being quite warm and kind when I'm having a good day. But either way, being myself or acting confident, I can sometimes come off as being abrupt or aloof or even arrogant which does ruffle some feathers.
7	Realist. 
4	I'm severely pessimistic.
5	I’m optimistic on the outside but in the inside I’m kinda pessimist and hard on myself 🙄
2	Maybe I’m mistyped lol. I’m overly confident 
2	I think everyone have the realistic side of them that would be considered pessimistic, but you’d lose (in life) if you always give in to that kind of thought. Living like that is also very boring imo so I learned to hype myself up. Probably due to my short temper whenever I think less of myself and feel that other people also think I wont succeed I get the fire burning in my heart saying “yea? Well fuck you I will do it and show you whats up” and thats my motivation. You’ll be surprised what you can achieve if only you give yourself a chance, even if you dont end up achieving your goal you would still have gone further than you have expected. Through those achievements and experiences you gain confidence, the feeling is very solid and not a pretense.  
1	Have you thought about therapy?
3	Are ISFP’s and ENFP’s compatible in a relationship?	I’m an ISFP currently dating an ENFP and it’s been quite challenging especially when it comes\nto communication. Is this common?
7	ENFP and there is no type that I think I would get on with better. We both have Fi-Te so we're both driven by our internal values, I can always count on ISFP's for a great conversation about ethics or philosophy. Se-Ni is something I envy and find truly amazing, I think it's also helpful that while one has a balanced judgement axis, the other has a balanced perceiving axis, so I feel both can help each other to balance their inferiors in some way. Imo both types come across as "quirky" so there's no pressure for conformity of social norms with the two. ISFP's have such an amazing memory and are so intelligent that that they blow me away, they're also so heckin' cute, I love em', I'm not sure how they view ENFPs but I feel like both types love arts and can definitely bond through exploring each others aesthetics and inner values.  In terms of communication, I'm usually very upfront about what is working, but it can take a while for me to reveal hidden feelings that may make me feel ashamed or guilty. Try let your ENFP word vomit and then they'll feel guilty for speaking so much so will intensely listen to you afterward. 
3	I'm an ISFP married to an ISTJ and communication is a struggle.    \nI think communication is tough in all relationships.
3	From what I've read and from experience (just casual conversations, no relationship), somewhat. Thing is, ISFPs are often somewhat overwhelmed by ENFPs and tend to feel inadequate when around them. And ENFPs may have a tendency to think that there's something 'wrong' with ISFPs and try to 'fix' them. (Supervisor - supervisee relation)
2	Hi, ENFP (F) in a relationship with a ISFP (M), and we had to learn (and still learning) how to communicate. ISFP is quiet, calm, practical in his thinking, and basically speaks only after he has thought something through. Me on the other hand, an ENFP, I'm anything but that. The first lesson I had to learn is that if ISFP is quiet that doesn't mean that something is off, the second one was that if he says something, he means it- both of which were wild concepts for me as I tend to word vomit, overthink, and question everything. Also, I had to learn that he shows his affection with his actions and by listening, rather than with words. What helped me was openly talking about it, and being able to ask questions (and give answers), as that helped me understand the way he thinks. Once I had a grasped how his brain works, the communication became easier. We still have communication issues, especially when I go into overthinking mode, and we're still learning, but honesty and mutual will to try to understand each other is what keeps us going. Hope it helps even if it's an ENFP's word vomit :P
1	I'm sorry but they're not. There is a strong attraction between the two because they activate each others but there's a massive problem hidden in there. The ENFP expects things from the ISFP that he cannot give. Doesn't matter how much the ISFP tries, nothing is good enough. It's not miscommunication it's simply the fact that your wants and needs are very different. And you're both touchy feelers who get upset easily. It's castrophic and hard to break. The only way that this could work is by massively surpressing yourselves. Even the idea that you might be compatible because you share Fi and Te is false. I'll save you the technicallity but in short you're not using those functions in the same way at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo ahead and fuck around but at some point you gotta move on from it because it'd be a huge waste when there are plenty of compatible types for you.
1	my bigger brother is ENFP and so are some of my best friends. i guess this "compatible relationship" thing is just a matter of having similar tastes and respecting each others differences
2	ISFP super powers?	What would you guys consider the most suitable "super power" for us?\n\nI imagined it'd be something like creating art pieces with a single touch on a surface, or transforming random objects into artworks, or drawing out hidden spirits in different places.
11	interdimensional travel
6	I can usually understand people's motivations for doing things or why/what they'd do next. Like a big picture of how their childhood, relationships, interactions, personality all interact together pretty precisely. It's not a super power. Some of my friends call me a people whisperer? i dont think so lol..  I find it pretty annoying a lot of the time.
4	Wouldn’t superpower be something that is supernatural for a person to have? In that case I think a superpower for ISFP would be the ability to always be able to force yourself to see a project though even if it makes you die inside the whole way lol
2	Ooh i like the last one! I think being super empaths would fit too
1	Being able to switch into "ENTJ mode" for a set amount of time would be useful.
1	I believe you're very good at learning skills
5	What do you think of the other Fi-using types?	Fi doms (ISFP & INFP):\n\nWell, can't say much about ISFPs, since it's kinda like talking about yourself. As for INFPs, I find them pretty nice, but the Ne makes them very different from ISFPs. They're also more accepting and open minded, it seems. Personally if someone rubs me the wrong way, I'll dislike them no matter the context or circumstances, but INFPs seem to always try and understand the other's viewpoint before making any judgements.\n\nFi aux-es (ESFP & ENFP)\n\nHonestly, I really don't understand Fi aux. It seems like it's actually not there, and their users are just using Se or Ne nonstop. Heck, sometimes they even seem like ESTPs or ENTPs if they're being mean or serious.\n\nFi tertiaries (ISTJ & INTJ)\n\nPretty cool. It's kinda like Fi dom, but more in the background. For whatever reason Fi seems more subdued with ISTJs to me. It also seems like they can get even more intense when their Fi gets violated than Fi doms sometimes.\n\nFi inferiors (ESTJ & ENTJ)\n\nThis kinda confuses me. At first glance I'm like "oh, they're Fi users too, cool.", but when you actually see them it's pretty much nonexistent. It's kinda like the PoLR Fi in ENTPs and ESTPs, but somehow different. Just odd.
5	As an ENFP, my Fi can be found easily when I'm talking about my social/political/economic values. I will fall apart literally if I'm forced to do anything that doesn't stimulate my Fi. Fi is what causes me to stick out, it's not conforming the way Fe is. Love of authenticity and hatred of tyranny is all based in my Fi values. When ENFPs "stick up for what they believe in" you bet there is a complex set of values that they are standing by with their Fi. 
5	What is the main diferences between isfp’s and isfj’s?	I’m confused about what type my mom is.\n
8	Functions stack for ISFP's is Fi Se Ni Te, ISFJs is Si Fe Ti Ne. They're very very different. ISFP's care very much about authenticity due to their dominant Fi and may appear quirky. Whereas ISFJs care very much about routine Si and Harmony Fe. Both are very functional in the real world. I would say that ISFJs are more open about their feelings because they have a balanced judgement axis, but less open to new experiences. ISFP's whilst care very much about authenticity, keep their true feelings quite hidden but have a balanced perceiving axis and are usually in my experience extremely intelligent. 
2	They are very different indeed. While both introverts, when together the ISFJ will likely be more talkative. ISJFs are extremely organized and diligent and tend to think and speak at a faster pace than ISFPs (in my experience at least). ISFJs are good at making decisions, ISFPs like to mull things over for a while. 
14	I hate mood swings	Seriously, what the hell, brain? Every day of the week I wish I could go home early so I can do stuff, and before you know it it's saturday night with HOURS of free time and... now I just feel empty and don't want to do anything? What a waste of time..\n\nAlso, pretty much every time I promise to work on or do something together with my INTJ cousin my excitement usually fades within an hour or so and I just force myself to go through it anyways.\n\nSigh.
8	If moods don't swing then you will be depressed all the time....
6	I’ve found that if I think about grand concepts and big ideas it gets overwhelming and I shut down. Best for me to just chip away on things consistently. Sometimes getting started is the hard part. I just tell myself, “I’m going to work on this for an hour.”  Set a timer.  Do the hour. If I’m feeling good about things keep going if not, at least I did an hour.
5	What are some captivating/beautiful music videos?	I think this relates to ISFP because of our sensing, but if it is not relevant enough, I understand that too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like Tame Impala's *The Less I Know the Better* but you should be warned that it is explicit.
3	i feel something everytime i see Cage The Elephant - Shake Me Down
2	In terms of stuff that has actually made me feel anything, I have to say:\n\n[After The Party - Mezingers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ghTYSXQnqbg&index=47&list=PLvTxyDOsBMMY2m7xB488vvMrJewuyoWtF)\n\n[Reverie - Arca](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0WKWZ9y-dvU&index=63&list=PLvTxyDOsBMMY2m7xB488vvMrJewuyoWtF) (explicit)\n\n[You, In Weird Cities - Jeff Rosenstock](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MbD_KegM_mQ&list=PLvTxyDOsBMMY2m7xB488vvMrJewuyoWtF&t=0s&index=52)\n\nBut then there’s Owen Pallett’s [Lewis Takes Off His Shirt](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7G-cqAehehA&list=PLvTxyDOsBMMY2m7xB488vvMrJewuyoWtF&index=40) has a eclectic, strange video that is very tonally different from the song itself (which is all soaring chords and orchestral beeps).

3	How do you get along with INTPs?	I always find it really awkward to be around INTPs. Of course, they're much easier to handle than ENTPs due to at least our shared trait of introversion, but it just.. doesn't seem to work. It's kinda like I'm (forgive the stereotypes) talking to a robot.\n\nI *think* I have 2 INTP friends (one typed as INTJ first but is definitely an INTP, and the other *could* be an ISTJ or an INTP, but I'm leaning more towards INTP), one who I've never met irl but sometimes talk to on IRC or Telegram, and one who I went to high school with, but don't really talk to anymore (nor do I really talk to any of my other high school friends, but that's another story). The first one goes reasonably well most of the time, but I always have to be the one to initiate conversation, and he tends to be very curt and to the point. He also takes extremely long to reply, (personally I almost always reply asap, can't stand having to let others wait) and sometimes he doesn't reply at all. The "read at x:xx PM" meme rings true. If I come to him with a question he'll answer it most of the time, though. But if I just come to him with anything else it's either "ok" or "read at x:xx PM", and very rarely a "lol".\n\nAs for the second friend, out of all my high school friends I talked to him the least. No particular reason, it just happened to be that way. Whenever we were alone we would talk, but it's very obvious that we come from very different perspectives. I remember talking to him about PC and consoles (I'm a very strong PC guy, generally dislike consoles), and he just listed various reasons why consoles are better, with a very subdued tone that just seems to imply "*obviously* it is". Got a little annoyed and didn't really say much after that. Conversation kinda fell silent.
5	INTP here. Actually interested in this question because I recently befriended an ISFP and I am really finding it a struggle to deepen conversation sometimes. Ti + Fi heroes really are like two different universes
4	I had a short friendship with an INTP. It didn't end well because he got annoyed that I couldn't deepen the conversation and I found it hard to keep conversations going with him. At the time he was the first INTP I had ever met so it was like "Cool, look at this interesting person. Let me get closer." I was really attracted his mind, but I couldn't hold it up on my part. So when we got in a fight I was arguing about feelings, he scoffed at that, then completely cut me out of his life. :)
2	Daria and Jane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a nice INTP friend, but I can't spend a super long time hanging out with them or I get a bit restless.

3	How do you feel about being accepted by and contributing to society?	This is something I notice a lot in Fe users, and it irritates me to no end. The endless will and need to be accepted (usually conforming to mindless trends, pop culture and behavior), and to accomplish something or contribute to society. These people always blame themselves whenever something is wrong, and they always do what others want. I mean, to a certain degree you should be polite and conform, but you really shouldn't give up being yourself for the masses needs, imo. And I really think that actually wanting to contribute to society is weird. I can't really comprehend wanting to do work outside of getting money, it seems like some sort of (excuse the tinfoil hat talk) manipulation done by the powers that be. \n\nOverall, sure. I think we should all just conform a little, be polite to each other, work is essential to life, but... I really can't comprehend it controlling your life so much outside of your obligations. \n\nWhat's your opinion on this?
5	Contributing to society isn't neccessarily tied conformity. I'm always acutely aware of how much I need other humans, and so I try to do my part. For me that doesn't mean fitting in, but to try and be decent, clean up my own messes, and leave things in as good a condition or better than how I found them. And more specifically, it means taking care of the people who sacrificed a lot to raise and take care of me.\n\nHave you heard of feral children? Kids who are raised with minimal human contact, some literally by wolves. After a certain age, it becomes impossible for the to learn languages. So they never adapt, and are never able to reintegrate as humans. They probably don't feel like they're missing out so they're fine. But when I think about things like language, music, *food*...it's beautiful and I want to participate in it, whether or not I will be accepted. In these sparkling aspects of civilisation.\n\nSometimes I wonder about the invention of bread. Who was the genius caveman who thought it up? "Like ah, let me spend the afternoon grinding up these seeds, just because. Maybe I'll add some water and make some goop. Now I'll make it into a ball and put it in the fire!" Like, that kind of thought process doesn't make sense coming from a single person. No, I think it must've been something discovered over the course of time, and the trial and error of many people. Now we've got all manner of cakes and pastries, and quite honestly it's like magic. It's only possible as the result of thousands of years of collective wisdom and experimentation. Human civilisation! We are pretty shitty, but we do some wonderful things, too.
5	I don't think it's an Fe thing exclusively. Fe is ethical, and Fi is moral. Being a "people pleaser" can have different roots if that makes sense.\n\nMaybe you do it because it's the right thing to do, maybe you do it because social pressure.
3	My contribution to society is something I criticize myself about when I am low, but not something that drives me
1	I think you're talking about two separate things there. Are you a young adult who's anxious about entering the workforce by any chance? Work can only erode your sense of self as much as you let it. Those people you're talking about just so happen to thrive in the terrarium of most work environments; that's who they are too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think ISFPs are particularly well suited to many business arenas. But we do what we must, I guess. What else can we do?
1	🤷‍♂️ Fuck em. 
10	Are you interested in hidden realities?	Any ISFPs interested in alternative universe, hidden worlds below our perceptions, or that we could be living in a matrix, wanting to figure out the truth about reality, believing in supernatural powers like chi, telekinesis, seeing auras, lucid dreaming, etc. \n\nThis could be due to Ni tert and make ISFPs interested in these things. \n\nSo what do you think? Is it common in ISFPs or is it an Ni thing? \n 
13	I mean, its hella interesting even talking about anything on the scale of universe, but since it may be impossible to find the truth I dont see a point overly thinking about it or looking up any articles/sources because they are guesses too.\n\nExcept lucid dreaming you mentioned, its proven and explained, and makes sense if you think about it
3	Oh yes, I've thought about those things a lot. Astral travel, astral projection, psychic perception, unconsciousness, spiritual realms, etc. although I don't think I can put it into words easily. I think we ISFPs might be people with a very normal front with some bizarre interests underneath.
2	Oh, definitely! I love analysis and theory, although it has to have actual proof for me to take it seriously.
2	I go back and forth on this kind of stuff. Sometimes I feel very inspired and filled with a sense of wonder. Other times, when not well supported I feel like I’ve been scammed.  Like it’s just fluff or pseudoscience. \n\nIt needs to be supported by real things for me to really be blown away.  I find the real world to be more interesting, so prove it’s real and I’m on board.  I want to believe it but I’m not going to just accept it because it was said.
2	It's a big deal to me. I study and practice many occult topics, I've been recording my dreams for many years and have finally gotten a grasp on lucid dreaming. I never really related it to mbti but yeah I bet Ni factors into it
9	Does anyone else find it hard to type/spot other ISFPs?	Whether in fiction or in real life, I funnily enough find it hardest to type/spot other ISFPs. I can type most other types with relative ease, but ISFPs are the hardest.
10	Not at all, I can sense their aura.
10	As INFP, I feel other INFPs tend to be boring on first impression?  I kick myself for not picking up clues I didn't expect,\n\nISFP's generally intimidate me because they seem perhaps focused, but intensely real.  ISFP's are hardcore.  Like no bullshit vibe but no fucking around vibe either.  
9	Finding your own type in another person is really difficult, but that happens with all 16 types. \n\nAlso when people that has the same type interact with each other it's really awkward because unconsciously you're trying to match a bit that person's personality (this happens to all humans in order to have a conversation), and your brain interprets that they must be another type, because they're not you.\n\nJust my 2 cents, I think human interaction is the culprit here!
6	-ENFP-\n\nNo, I literally know right away if they're an ISFP. Doesn't sound scientific they just give off a very specific vibe imo
5	No it's really easy. They're quiet but if they want to talk to someone they will, so I see them as cool and confident.\n\n&#x200B;
4	Usually when I talk to them I pick up a vibe, since we all tend to be laid back and low energy. 
4	I think they’re pretty obvious to me. I know one: He’s really laid back and quiet while at the same time has this kind of intense and action oriented vibe. And you can clearly see the Fi and Se but Fi is dominating it. \n\n*wish it was that easy to type myself hnnnnnggggggg*
7	ISFPs- I find them not as common as other S-types. They are the most introverted of all peoples. If someone is the quietest in the group, it is probably an ISXP. Prefers action over words. Would rather walk across the room and pick something up, than ask someone to pass it to them. Would rather put their hand on your shoulder than say, ‘I love you.’ Will not initiate conversation. Will not initiate anything. You can spot the ISFP from noticing the silence/empty space, rather than trying to find the ISFP.
2	ISFP guy asked me out- do I deserve him?	  \n\nNote: Im INFJ; Dave is ENFP; Daniel is ISFP\n\nTwo years I fell in love with Dave (F18). But I was in denial about my feelings so I did not did anything about it. Six months later he got a girlfriend (F18) and they are happily together since then. Their relationship is stable. Meanwhile I suffered in silence. I was really lovesick. For example I felt at some point even unable to sleep and to eat (I lost as a result 8 lbs ;im still barely not underweight). I always thought that I would be forever alone.\n\nOver times is got better. I am able again to function normally in life and Im reasonably happy. But I still think every day of Dave. So I m not totally over him.\n\nYesterday a guy whom I will call Daniel asked me out for a date. Daniel is a friend (but not an extremely close friend) of mine since five years. \n\nI told him that I know this is really unfair to him but I cant answer him right now whether I want to go on a date with him. I feel terrible for leaving him in limbo and treating him like that, but I just felt unable to give him an even half part reasonable answer.\n\nI feel like dating him is a great opportunity for me to forget Dave and I think that Daniel and I might be a good match. I like him a lot and I love spending time with him.\n\nOn the other hand I am terribly afraid of starting to date. And I still cling far too much too the past. Also I am afraid that I might be emotionally not healthy and stable enough to date. I often think that I am unlovable.\n\nAlso I fear that I might hurt Daniel or myself by doing something stupid. I absolutely don’t want to hurt Daniel or loose his friendship.\n\nWhat should I do? What is the best for me and Daniel?\n\n**TL;DR I fell in love and was in denial about my own feelings. I suffered in silence. Now another guy asked me out.** 
8	I don't think dating someone as an opportunity to forget about someone else ever really ends well. and even if it does, it's not the best place to start.
3	Long post incoming - INFJ here that just happened to be lurking on this subreddit and I happened to come across your post.  So sorry you're feeling this way, but you reminded me of myself when I was younger and I know what that feels like, it totally sucks. As someone who can relate to what you're going through, I thought I could offer some perspective. \n\nFirst thing's first- you deserve love. You're absolutely worthy of it. But the most important thing is going to start with cultivating love for yourself. You will never believe you deserve Daniel or Dave or anyone's love for that matter if you can't see what there is to love about you. I know I used to be baffled when people showed interest in me and didn't understand it. I started going to a therapist and devouring a lot of information on psychology and personal development before I began to control the same heinous voice in my head that told me I was unlovable. Sometimes it's still a battle and that voice creeps in, but I have to actively remind myself it's a distortion. I don't need to know you to know that you are lovable and worthy. \n\nSecond - I don't see any harm in going on a date with Daniel considering you mentioned you've been friends for years, you get along and said yourself you think you may be a good match. I think it may be an INFJ thing, especially when we're young to try to project and see into the future. I remember up until a few years ago I'd pretty much turn down dates with anyone unless I thought it could turn into a long-term relationship.  But the thing was, I couldn't really know that unless I tried dating them, it was just my INFJ introverted intuition trying to tell me what the future might hold. Also, like you, I would get extremely attached to one person at a time, which was usually some sort of unattainable crush (which is sounds like Dave is for you) and would have horse-blinders on for them and not be able to see myself with anyone else. I think you can shift your perspective a bit - Daniel is not someone you're using to get over Dave unless you choose to look at him in that way. Rather you're staying open-minded to the possibility of something with Daniel. You already know you get along and maybe there could be something there, but even if he isn't the person you'll be with for the rest of your life, it's not the end of the world if things don't work out, instead it's an opportunity to learn about yourself and relationships. You just get to start seeing there are other people out there for you, and then day by day you'll find yourself thinking about Dave less and less.\n\nSide note - I'm an INFJ who has been dating an ISFP for the past few months (that's how I found myself on this subreddit). And he's super caring and sweet and thoughtful. He also gets me out of my head and encourages me to live more in the present moment. He honestly doesn't even understand how my brain can go off in a million different directions and calculate all the different possible outcomes and he seems to deal with a lot less anxiety because of it. I think that's an awesome thing sensors can offer to us intuitive types and it's worth exploring relationships with people who may see the world a little differently. 
4	You should only date daniel if you know you have feelings for him. Any other reason would be not a good reason.

3	Enneagram type	Hello kindred spirits, \n\nAnyone here know their enneagram type? \n\nDo you think your enneatype has influenced you as an ISFP? Has it shaped you in ways that might not be typical of an ISFP? Or maybe shaped you in more typical ISFP ways? \n\nThank you for your insight! 
3	I think I'm 4w5, but not completely certain. I suppose it does make me more serious and intense in certain situations than the stereotypical more laid back "Stoner" ISFPs.
3	I'm a 4w3.... 
2	I hope answering my own question isn’t too self indulgent but...\n\nI’m a 2w1. I think being an ISFP has made me more independent for a typical 2. I think being a 2 has drawn me moretowards love and partnering, for a typical ISFP. I love love a lot and although I need time alone, I feel best when I am in a loving and supportive partnership. \n\n
2	I am a 9w1 Which I think more or less is the same as an ISFP in most traits. I don't get too deep into either test really but I like to hang around and talk about it with people that know more than me. 
1	[deleted]
1	I haven't been able to get into enneagram all that much, but I believe I'm a 4w3 sx. I know it sounds kind of silly, but I feel like the description is almost *too* accurate, and it freaks me out a little lol.
0	Understanding other	Hi all, ENFP here. I have an ISFP brother who I'm very close with but often have a lot of trouble communicating with. Recently, I went through something pretty upsetting and my way of dealing with it is trying to understand the other person better and why they did what they did. (Hence why I'm interested in MBTI). He gets very annoyed at me when I do this and tries to get me to connect more with my feelings in the present moment. I understand the value in this, and it's helped me a lot, but I also don't think that trying to understand the other person is necessarily a bad thing. But when he does this (he tells me that I'm being dumb and annoying when I do this), he makes me feel very ashamed and down. I'm trying to understand why he would say or do this. I feel like it has to do with an undeveloped function that's more developed in me?
4	ISFPs seem to get pretty close minded and set in their ways when annoyed, angry or upset. I know I am. \n\nBasically, we don't get Ne at all and under the previously mentioned circumstances we'll just be like "screw that shit, just act normal". \n\nI say just do you, and perhaps try to understand each other better in more relaxed circumstances, things go way easier then.
1	Just present your feelings in the moment.  There are many things that can't be explained.
4	I(SFP) like this song, do you? Django Django - Found You (Official Audio)	
2	Hm. It’s growing on me (I like the instruments.) Do you like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TJI7BpEL_Zs) one?
2	I'm not really wild about it to be honest. My main songs right now are probably "easy" by son lux, "The Loser" by Zach Farache, and "Coming Home" by Leon Bridges. I also listen to a lot of hip hop and stuff, but I'm not really sure what to make of this particular genre??
2	Kind of reminds me of music from the 60s
2	I like it. It feels modern and medieval at the same time
3	Does your Se ever get tired?	And then you withdraw?
8	Always 
7	It sometimes happens in the middle of someone talking to me. If they are talking too much I lose my inability to process what they are saying and I just have to pretend like I’m listening. Especially if they are speaking without a point and just rambling. I feel bad, and I try to listen but it’s like my brain gets overwhelmed and shuts down lol
3	Always (and never, at the same time)
2	What's a Se?
1	Se is the only way I don't withdraw tbh
10	Me and my S/O are looking to get a dog and are visiting two kennels tomorrow!!	I'm so excited! The first one we're visiting is a kennel  where we'll be meeting a 1 1/2 y/o boy and the other ones are only 4 weeks old! Never thought I was a dog person but who knew! Can't sleep! 
1	Congrats thats amazing!! Yay, pudoo! I hope to get a dog one day too.
1	Awe! Hope you guys find the perfect little bud.
1	Yay!! Dogs are the best:). As soon as I move out and am financially stable, a pup will be my number one priority lol. What kind of dog is  it??
7	Curious. Do any of you suffer from/struggle with depression and/or SAD (seasonal affective disorder)?	
7	I'm sad a lot so I'm not sure if it's seasonal haha.. I have either high highs or low lows. Not sure if it's normal 
6	INFP and oh yes.  \n\nSummer or GTFO.\n\nBut my ISFP makes any season feel just like heaven.  I don't even care what season it is any more.  She is like summer :)
6	I do and I’m on medication for it. I have depression and anxiety. Sucks but that’s life for ya. 
5	Yes, but learning about myself and learning something useful that applies to my life helps a lot.\n\nI need to feel like I'm needed and when winter comes around I have to shift my focus on myself more. Then I feel happy
3	I do, but like, for every season
2	I suspect I may have SAD, but I haven't been diagnosed or anything.
2	I haven't been diagnosed but I feel depressed quite frequently.. I guess it happens mostly when i spend too much alone time? I also work from home so I tend to get distracted a lot which leads to me feeling unproductive, and then i start thinking too much. \n\nISFPs' negative loop is the Fi-Ni loop, so we tend to overanalyze things a lot, get stuck in our feelings and are unable to relate to the way things are in world. Then we get anxious about things and the world because we're so stuck in our heads. I find myself in this a lot and then can't see the point of things a lot of the time? Why do we do what we do? Why do we do anything? To get out of the loop we need to go to our second, supporting function, Se. And really, I find that when I do something creative (I draw, I also make jewelry), or yoga, hiking, or dancing, it takes me out of my mind and into my body, physically experiencing the world. That helps me experience things in the now and kind of doens't give me the time to overthink things. It's hard to get yourself to go actually do these things sometimes but it's so worth it. \n\nThis lasts until I feel like i need to retreat again and then the cycle starts again :-/ 
1	SAD, yes. I really come out of my shell and feel like a new person when summer comes around.
1	I have pretty major depressive episodes that usually last for several weeks. I don't think I have SAD though. Practicing mindfulness does seem to help me a lot though. Like, taking the time to actually eat real food and make sure I'm sleeping enough and just allowing myself to fully take in my surroundings a lot certainly helps, although of course it isn't a cure lol.
13	Does anyone else feel like they don't really know/understand themselves all that well?	I mean, I'm fairly certain I'm ISFP, but outside of MBTI I don't really 'get' myself.
5	That's why I studied mbti haha\n\nBut no, I don't trully know myself either. And I'm not okay with it.
3	Probably something I’d deal with with my therapist 
3	To a certain extent, I think that's okay. I know my tendencies, but every now and then I surprise myself. I don't think personhood is a static thing, so even if you have a full understanding of yourself from a particular time, it will change. And that's fine. Some people you know all your life, but you can still find out new things about them. Same with yourself
3	I have no idea who I am either, but I'm okay with it. I have to say, though, that I "feel most myself" when I'm out in nature or looking at/watching/listening to/reading/eperiencing something beautiful.
3	I feel like I spent my first 30 years of life living as I thought I should based on the guidance of others. Then after a bout of depression and 3 years of therapy, I've been discovering myself lately and I love it. \n\nI also think that Fi's need for deep understanding makes us feel like we don't know ourselves well when other types wouldn't necessarily make this conclusion.
2	For sure. I feel like I best understand myself when I get in the habit of writing my thoughts in a diary at the end of the day.
2	Yes! How other people describe me usually catches me off guard. Based on what others have said, I'm a lot quieter, more 'peaceful', more grounded, more serious and more logical than I realize. It's always strange though, because I view myself almost entirely in a different light. I think of myself as pretty talkative and goofy and kind of annoying, almost ditzy. While that side definitely comes out more with close friends, I tend to think that's how I portray myself to the entire world, when typically, I'm simply the 'nice, quiet girl'. I actually thought I was an EXFP for a while, until I realized how often people would mention how quiet or difficult to get to know I was when they first met me. I'm not entirely sure on the ISFP thing either, because I have a difficult time differentiating between whether that is who I truly am or more how I want to be.
1	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
6	This is hilarious xD
15	please help	hey guys I’m an ISFP obviously ahaha I would like to know if any other ISFPS highly struggle with telling others when they are annoying you. for instance: is someone hurts my feelings or annoys me I won’t tell the person because I severely struggle w letting out my emotions so I tend to ignore them unintentionally and they get very very mad at me bc I’m being selfish and taking their feelings granted ( bc i’m taking my time as if they’re always gonna be there) however I do take a LOT of time to process how I’m feeling days even weeks and once I do confront them I start crying bc it’s too overwhelming! i’m sorry for spamming you but I would love to know if u struggle w this as well and if so how u deal w it ! have a good day 💖🤧
9	I struggle but because I say gibberish when I'm explaining my feelings, so I kind of wish they read my face lol.
4	I'm great at telling my feelings and annoyances to people I know very, very well. People who I know will not abandon me if we hit a rough patch (i.e. my husband, my parents).\n\nI'm not as good at explaining annoyances to friends and best friends because I either A) decide I need to be more accepting of the way they view things, don't want to hurt their feelings, and decide it's not worth losing the friendship, or B) I decide I know the person won't receive it well based on my read on them.\n\nIn both A and B scenarios, I always need to take a break from them to process, process, process. It's like solving a Rubik's cube. 'Maybe they're like that because of this... or that, etc." I try, almost to a fault, to see things from their perspective, assess why I'm so offended, and whether I'm being irrational. This can take weeks. Sometimes I process the conflict so much, I get over it. Or I'll set new mental boundaries with that person such as "When I'm around so-and-so, I will not bring up \[ X \] topic." If ultimately I decide the friendship isn't worth keeping, I slowly pull away. I will not 'ghost' people like I did when I was younger because it's not right to blatantly cut people off. But I will do the slow pull away so it's not so painful.\n\nThe intense ruminating and processing helps me to decide between letting the issue go, pulling away from the friend temporarily while I lick my wounds, pulling away permanently from them, or, the dreaded idea of confronting them.\n\nIf they do actually ask me if something is bothering me, I usually see this as a chance to have a conversation and how we can work on it. It will depend on the person though and if I perceive things going well in the conversation.\n\nI know I should be more fair to people by allowing them to explain. Because even in my 'amazingly empathetic' processing, I am still making assumptions and not allowing them to defend themselves or to point out my shortcomings (gasp!). I shouldn't shy away from confrontation with friends and should be more upfront when I'm bothered by something they did, but you know ISFPs and confrontation. I get emotional too and just want to cry getting the words out. The confrontation has to be very much so 'worth it' for me to engage.\n\nI have found, however, as I age, that I'm not as afraid of confrontation with non-friends. It's empowering. Now, if only I could mature and work on healthy confrontation with friends...
2	As an INTP who has dealt / is dealing with this... yes you guys have problems with that sometimes... i am currently being ignored and it hurts like hell. I realize you guys have a hard time expressing yourselves candidly, but please, if you can find it within yourself, just tell them as soon as possible. Most good friends would be willing to change their behavior if they knew it was annoying. Dont be afraid to ask for things.😱
1	My brother is like that with me. It hurts a lot when he avoids me rather than explain to me what he's thinking. He's decided that he just has to deal with the feelings of hurting me rather than avoid me. 
1	Could I be an ESFP, ENFP, INFP, ISFP, or neither?	I’m fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it’s dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I’ve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I’m stumped trying to find out. \n\nI’ll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  \n\n**My main reasons for INFP** are the Fi-Si loop: I‘m sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I’m not ready to let them go, and I’d like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don’t want to forget, I believe that they aren’t truly gone unless you forget about them. I don’t care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it’s comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don’t display a lot of your average Se traits, I’m pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I’m not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I’m pretty un-assertive and I don’t like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It’s not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn’t like being above people, I’d rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it’s something that I’m truly passionate about though, I’m absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I’d really “take the lead” that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I’m passionate about hits. \n\n**My main reasons for ESFP:** I feel like I’m too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I’ve gotten feedback about being very naïve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can’t even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I’m looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can’t relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don’t mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I’ve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I’ve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, “you need to look at the big picture,” think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I’d go ahead and then it just blows up in my face. \n\nBased on my evaluation (and if necessary, my profile shows my previous type me posts), what would you reckon I could be?
2	Do you mind being the center of attention? Do you like going to parties when you know there will be unknown people? \n\nIf yes, I’d say you’re extraverted.
2	You come off like an ENFP to me. The reams of text read very NFP and it's almost stereotypical for ENFPs to waver between saying they're INFP or ENFP.\n\nNe isn't necessarily always about intuiting what will happen in the future or examining your own 'deep' thoughts. In fact I would say it's almost the opposite. Ne is *extroverted* intuition, which means you might be a big thinker but a lot of the time you're bouncing your ideas off of people around you. In my limited experience Ne users are more interested in talking and being around people to share ideas and hear other people's thoughts, while Se users tend to focus on concrete experiences, which don't necessarily require talking or commenting on the moment.\n\nRuminating deeply on only internal information ('go\[ing\] deep into my thoughts') is more of a Ni thing.\n\nThe MBTI is more about how you process information and the world around you than about a blueprint for the kind of person you are. I'm an ISFP and I tend to only wear what's comfortable, and I'm extremely clumsy. But compared to my Ne-using friends, I'm much more focused on the 'moment' and more interested in understanding and accepting concrete reality than a multitude of possibilities.
6	Do you meditate?	
3	Short answer: no but I've tried it.\n\nLong answer: I had some success with short guided meditation using the Headspace app. So when my therapist suggested a Mindfullness Based Stress Reduction class, I signed up. But I had just started a relationship and just could not stop myself from thinking about him the whole time I was supposed to be meditating. Haven't attempted again since then. 
3	Did it for a while but eventually realized it's useless to me.
2	Yep every day
2	[deleted]
2	Yoga really helped me start! Look up Yoga/breathing techniques on YouTube. Helps get the technique down, my key tip is just always count your breaths/ focus on your breaths and calmly bring yourself back to that once you find yourself thinking about bills/school/family etc.
1	I feel ISFPs are more acceptable to meditation. 
1	Yes but only when I feel like I really need it. Sometimes I get very overwhelmed with the people around me and all the things I have to do. So, I find at least a few minutes and I just close my eyes and focus on my breathe and I take as much time as I think I need. Hope this helps. 
22	Why is 90% of this sub dating advice?	Just because we know our morals and values doesn't mean we are experts at dating. 
23	Because no one wants to take the time to understand the isfp in their life. So they look for the "easy way" and ask us.
13	Most of this sub is just, "How do I get the ISFP in my life to open up?"
6	Because people don't know about r/mbtidating
5	seeing other people´s needs and feelings	are you also struggling with seeing what for example your partner feel in a situation or what is going on in him? what he feels or what would sheer him up? \nyou found a way to get better at this ?
3	I know nothing flatters me more than when my ISFP asks me about how I feel or gives me her attention.  She is such a beautiful creature of the moment, I feel a little unworthy of her focus.  -INFP btw
5	To those who are ghosting somebody.	In response to some posts i have seen where IxFPs call people who open up to them "toxic" and claim they were "forced to ghost them". People who share everything with you are not necessarily toxic, and it is most certainly not ENTIRELY their fault that they have one sided conversations with you. Friendships involve give and take, which means if they share with you a lot, it might be nice to do the same. Can you truly blame them for expecting a little bit of trust from a person who they trust so much? \n\n You Fi doms often have issues with sharing and communicating. Sure you are great listeners, but what if somebody actually wants to get to know you? I know in my case i was head over heels and i wanted to become closer, i thought if i shared with her she would share with me... nope. She continued to treat me like i was nobody. When i said that i liked her, she told me she "wasn't ready for a relationship" instead of telling me the truth (she just doesn't like me that way)... which i eventually dragged out of her. AND I WAS FINE WITH THAT. She said she wanted to stay friends, and i believed her. But all of a sudden, no texts, no hanging out, no saying hi at church... and when i asked her about it she made a bunch of excuses, and told me that she was distant with ALL her friends... who i clearly saw her talking to and laughing with whilst she ignored me... I wasnt mad that she didn't share, I wasnt mad that she didnt care about me, i was furious that she lied to me and caused me to waste so much time and effort. I made an effort to tell her the truth, in all the time i knew her, and all she ever did was play along. And when things got even the tiniest bit uncomfortable, she kicked me out of her life, and LIED to me because she was to scared to tell me the truth.\n\nI know there were an awful lot of "I"s and "me"s in this post... but i just want to let everyone on this sub know that ghosting, ignoring and lying are INFINITELY worse than just telling the truth and getting it overwith. Lying to somebody doesn't protect them, it protects YOU. So even though its hard, be honest with people... and dont pretend to be their friend if you're not. K im done.

3	Always best to use tit for tat( mmh dictionary seems to only think this is negative like punishment. Where as I think of it as neutral). For example, if you call her. Then next time she has to call you.  If she cares, she will call. If she does not then game over and not much wasted.\n\n
5	What's your favorite food?	For me it's a tie between fries with a [frikandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frikandel), and pizza.
8	Pizza, 100%
8	sushi
5	cheesecake! 
5	This is hard lol. But I would say curry and chicken.
4	Turkey pot pie. I love Thanksgiving and then my mom makes turkey pot pie with the leftovers so it's not only my favorite food but it's also quite sentimental
4	Stew!
2	Steamed cabbage!\n\nYum I could eat so much
2	Chicken piccata, sushi, chocolattttte, cheesecake-ice cream, edamame, pomegranate, Wendy’s Asiago chicken club sandwich with no bacon, midnight milky ways, cherries 
1	coffee and chocolate!
1	Ribs are yummy. Also, I have a weird thing for meatloaf and mashed potatoes. It’s not that weird. Ugh, I’m so hungry!! 
7	Synthwave	Anyone else dig synthwave/ retrowave music?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/euvLdOwLnXU\n​\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bzmWpyuqucU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XWpeq3DgGAo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/x-42Zkcw4Cs\n\nhttps://youtu.be/um3MinjQLH0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/76TKOxjbgNQ
3	Yeah, and I also love 80s music.
2	Reminds me of A Real Hero by College and Electric Youth, but I don't really make a habit out of listening to music like synthwave. But I like 80's a lot of the time. 
1	https://youtu.be/D7IKcBZqp3s
1	Mhmmm. I like pretty much any out-of-the-ordinary music.
7	Do you know your IQ?	I figure we ISFPs are pretty smart... in our own way 
8	I had the Weschler test and was diagnosed as having very high IQ. But I feel like an idiot most of the time. Can't figure out if I'm the stupid one or if others are stupid, if that makes sense.
12	Nope, and I really don't care about that. It doesn't mean anything.
3	I got tested as a 13 year old by a psychologist when they were trying to diagnose my attention problems. 125 then, idk if that’s changed now. 
3	Took the test, got 130 once and 128 twice. Not sure how much of a valid measure it is though
1	Took a test could be valid, but idk it was on the internet so not likely. But it said 119
1	I haven't taken an official test but online I get somewhere around 120-130 range. So in other words. I have no real idea. No. I'm curious but not enough to pay for a test
1	I got officially tested by a psychologist, they never told me the number but they either said it was high, or above average. I can’t remember exactly what was said to me. 
1	Most online tests rank me 125-130ish so it must be at least 110 in reality
1	I always did well in school (book learning), but I really suck with hands on stuff or anything mechanical.   My book smarts do nothing to help out with that. lol
1	I took it once and i dont remember the number exactly but it was average. It wasnt a *real* iq test though just a sample version so im taking that as indication that im still *probably* a super genius.
2	Anyone taken an Enneagram test? I’m a 9w wing 1. What type are you?	
8	Everytime I take it it's something different so I don't really know.
2	4w3 
2	Same, 9w1
2	8w9\n\nEdit: I can actually see me being a 4w5 or 1w9, too. I don’t know much about enneagram.\n
2	9w1
2	649 tritype. 6w5-4w5-9w8.
2	9w1. I would say it matches me but honestly I wish I knew more about enneagram to actually know what it means
1	Honestly I find it pretty hard to pinpoint, but I guess I'm 4w5.
1	5w7/4
1	6 or 4 probably.
1	9w1 
1	6 wing 5 
1	A surprising number of 6s
6	What do you do in your free time?	Hi ISFP friends I’m back! Just curious as to what y’all do in your free time! I’m back on a self-care kick and am trying to find new things to do to, hobbies to take up, just to switch things up and not be so comfortable!\n\nI bartend and serve for work, spend time hiking, watching tv, and mainly drinking with friends.
3	roller skate, draw, watch tv, hang out with friends, read, take walks, etc. 
3	I just try and find new music, i live in a chaotic household so i drive a lot and find new roads around where i’m from, so i just combine the 2. if not that i play games lol 
2	Currently it's a bit of a routine of working on exams, playing games (mostly JRPGs and Visual Novels), watching anime, reading manga and practicing drawing.
2	no one mentioned any sports so far, how come?? I rock climb and boulder a lot.\n\nalso, reading books, playing DnD, worldbuilding, currently painting a lot of digital maps for said worldbuilding, haha.\n\nI like to play Marathon games of Civ V. 
2	I play PC games (mostly Dota 2) and watch youtube vids, mostly about new pc/console games that look nice, sport higglights, food preparation. Then I use to do sport but recently moved and still finding a place to do that. But I mean it all depends how I feel. 
2	Lately I’ve been trying to find new hobbies and I’ve been getting into making sweets and jewelry. I also really like makeup/fashion, trying new things & seeing new places, & of course hanging with friends.
2	I'm a huge gamer. I'm not into shooters so my main jams are Starcraft, Sims 3, Rocket League, sometimes Stardew Valley lol. Also love old DOS games like Descent and the original Tomb Raider.
1	If I'm hanging out at home, I'll YouTube or play mobile games. If I'm out, I'll probably be hanging out with one friend or exploring some kind of place
1	I'm in gradschool and newly married with a part time job to supplement our income. So not much (any) free time. \nI look forward to the days where I can backpack again, or play videos games, or knit and binge watch the office. 
1	Drumset and Ableton programming are my hobbies, Netflix and YouTube take up a large amount of my free time especially after work.
1	Oh wow, awesome and good on you for getting in some self care!  For me, on weekdays I have work, but after work I go to the gym to do some classes like body combat etc just to feel generally healthier haha!\n\nOn the weekends, if I don't have plans with friends, I'm at home relaxing and watching youtube, netflix etc or even exercising if I had missed the gym haha!\n\nSometimes, I get bored of that and visit my friend who lives quite close to me and play Nintendo Switch with them, or spend time with them by watching movies etc.\n\nOther times, I have moods where I feel like going out, so after work on Friday I go out with workmates for drinks and dancing :)\n\nAll in all, not too exciting weekend I would say, but actually love the balance of both being alone and being with friends :)
1	Ironically I'm an artist. I draw and paint pictures! outside of that, I love makeup and skincare, fashion, heavy metal and studying different religions.
1	I travel and like to make short documentaries just for the fun of it, or I like to do photography. I also love food and going to new restaurants for me is amazing, trying out the new food especially in new countries!
4	Were there rumors about you spread in school due to your introversion? If so, what were they?	
17	That I thought I was better than everybody else because I never talked. Joke's on them, I was just cripplingly shy
7	That I was stuck up because I gave people “dirty looks.”
5	Junior high that i was gay didn't gain much traction though I like girls I just hide my feelings towards them so I don't blame them for thinking I was gay
5	"When you go nuts and bring a gun, don't shoot me" is something someone actually said to me. 
3	All this comments about dirty looks... I do that too. In high school people bullied me because I was not chatty, but if there was any rumor, I didn't know about it.
3	For me, someone thought I hated everybody because I didn't speak to too many studemts at the time.
2	I was severely underweight in high school due to an eating disorder and had to leave halfway through freshman year to receive treatment. when I got back I heard that apparently I used hard drugs and had to leave for rehab. I didn't talk to anyone in high school so nobody really heard the truth from me.
2	Nope. People just thought I was weird. Which I pretty much agree.
1	I'm told that there were rumours about me, but I never heard what they were and I didn't really want to.
1	People used to test their jokes on me because I had a reputation for not smiling much
10	How can we make this sub more active?	I mean, 3800~ subscribers aren't *that* many people, but the sub is very quiet. Especially compared to subs like /r/infp and /r/intj. 
43	It’s just the way of the ISFP
11	We're in-the-moment folks. I think more about what colors I could use in my room to make it homier than reddit and stuff! Also I think ISFP's prefer to upvote others and don't like to clutter things with responses that we feel are unnecessary or repetitive? Which makes for tiny and polite, to-the-point comment sections.
9	I want to see more art\n\nBut I am not going to post it
10	When I first joined I posted a fair amount. I think we just are too comfortable with who we are or something. IDK just spitballing
5	We just have to post more. People are still scrolling (evidenced by your post)
12	r/Infp and r/intj are just giant circle jerks at this point. Im glad we havent gotten that big tbh.
3	Chat room even though I'm not isfp lol
1	Turn us into intuitives.
3	isfps what does a fi-ni loop look like?	i read about almost all loops.but i have never dug into the fi-ni loop that you isfps have.anyways,as isfps,what does an fi-ni loop look like?what happens inside your head when you in this loop.explain in detail,also im taking it,it has to be very abstract since ni and fi are the most abstract functions.do you ever get to points were you cant verbalize your ideas at all because of this,anyways just describe there whole thing to me pls,thanks,:)
6	I'm not entirely sure, but I think it has to do with fearing the future and thinking of bad outcomes.
3	Fi is that unique feeling things have all the time that you can’t really explain with words, and then sometimes you go to “I want what I want when I want it,” which is Se, and then *really* sometimes you go to Ni, which is thinking in pictures, metaphors, randomly knowing how someone will react or what someone is going to say, and when you do things like, “I was seeing it, but I wasn’t seeing it.” Fi-Ni is only Fi and then only Ni and then only Fi and then only Ni. Basically don’t be anal about being anxious for those of you with stronger metacognition. If you don’t get what I mean don’t worry about it. \n\nI’m an ENFP though.
2	https://personalityhacker.com/podcast-episode-0218-3-styles-of-cognitive-function-loops-part-1/
3	what makes isfps so creative?	many..many..of the greatest artists have been isfps.micheal jackson.mick jagger,ect ect....anyways how do you as isfps view art?,how does your fi-ni come up with artistic ideas?,also,do you often writ poetry?
7	I think we are apt to physically express our feelings and experiences, it makes for great storytelling. 
6	While doing/making art can be subjective, I think you shouldn't use logic or rationality too heavily. We're very feely and visual people, so that helps us when making art. I could be making art about a place, a certain experience I had, or a feeling, anything really. Art doesn't really have to come from imagination or reality strictly, sometimes it can be both. Personally I think it's the Fi and the interplay of our Se and Ni that can be perfect for doing art. \n\nI can say I'm not as interested in poetry as visual art or music. (I also haven't done that many artistic projects as of yet, but I can feel my brain brimming with new artistic ideas.)\n\n(edit: you did ask how I come up with artistic ideas. To that, my answer is don't know. It's heavily inspired by moods though sometimes)
7	I don't understand either, but I guess it's Fi telling us what we want to do, and Se giving us an idea of how we should express it.
6	Tertiary Ni coupled with dominant Fi. We don't use Ni as a primary process to get ahead in life, but we play with it. I thought I was INFJ for a long time because my Ni loves to pop up everywhere and use people and things from my life as inspiration for my artistic works, or gives them symbolism (you get the image of Fi colouring Ni?). But I don't trust it too much to make decisions, for example. Fi tends to pour its sauce on Ni waaaay too easily. Se and Te remind me to be grounded in reality.
5	I think creativity is something everyone has, but it can also be cultivated. It so happens we're predisposed to act on the creative impulse when it comes. The same people who think we're like, whimsical art monkeys also wonder how we come up with so many good ideas. It's because we have a lot of practice developing ideas. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. But if you're always telling yourself ew no, this is a dumb idea, or never acting on them, then you never get anywhere
3	[deleted]
3	Maybe they’re born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline!
2	There brand of creativity comes from Fi drive to express individuality+Se awareness of physical surroundings. Listen to Jimmy Hendrix pure Fi+Se.
6	What do you think of ENTPs?	They're kind of a morbid obsession of mine, generally I really dislike them, but I'm also very intrigued by them at the same time. Kinda like how a villain in a game or anime usually takes most of my attention.\n\nBut anyways, I generally find them rather odd. They kind of feel like real people acting like characters from fiction, just not.. real.\n\nFirst off there's that childlike and playful vibe they have, kinda like an ENFP, but with a very mean bite behind it all. Kinda like how in some media there are villains that act cutesy, cheery and bubbly, but deep within they're just thinking of ways to kill and torture as many people as possible. It's almost like they're some sort of evil robot that's disguised as a teddy bear.\n\nWhat also really mystifies me is how they tend to be so well-liked by others. I mean, they say pretty much everything that comes up in their heads, whether or not it's appropriate. Heck, as far as I can tell they enjoy it even more if someone does get offended. It's almost like only ISFPs can see their "real form", whereas they wear a disguise that makes them seem acceptable to other people.\n\nTheir lack of Fi is also really weird to me. Then again, as a Fi dom I guess that's natural, but I don't really seem to notice this all that much in ESTPs. ENTPs are pretty much the Anti-Fi. We can talk about this all we want, but I guess this is just something I will never get, so whatever.\n\nAlso, something I find really funny is that I tend to share interests with ENTPs a lot, even though as people we couldn't be more different.\n\nBuuuuuut I've also seen a couple of ENTPs that just act rather formal and don't really try to step on your toes. I guess those are the more mature ones? They seem alright.
12	god i hate entp's
11	Annoying edgelords
8	I can't stand most of the ones I've met. They're so damn obnoxious and arrogant and their obsession with making other people uncomfortable is infuriating. 
6	They can be very harsh, but that's their nature. They'll value facts over feelings and I think that's okay, that's how I make decisions although it hurts. But I would never date an ENTP. As a friend they sound really nice to talk to, though.
5	I dated an ENTP for 4 years! It was a healthy and fulfilling relationship for the most part. He is still one of my best friends who I love unconditionally and see weekly. I’m really glad we are not dating though because we were very different and towards the end I think I was bringing him down. \n\nI think ENTPs get a bad rep because emotionally immature or unhealthy ENTPs are insufferable. But ones with more developed Fe are wonderful and creative and dynamic! They do talk a lot. Living with one was a lot of noise.\n\nI see why ISFPs wouldn’t get along with ENTPs but I also think we align on a few things. For example we both loved novelty and experiencing new things so we travelled really well together. I liked all the sensory experiences and he liked the ideas and inspiration from the novelty. We lived well enough together but he needs to go out with friends constantly and I have to balance nights with people and nights alone. We both liked science fiction movies and the idea of time travel. I got him into politics and he ended up getting so into understanding political systems and taught me a lot and helped me broaden my understanding. \n\nI think we naturally clash with ENTPs but I think people can form a healthy relationship with any type, if both people are mature enough. 
3	I was in a majorly unhealthy relationship with one for a few years. I was completely obsessed and they were constantly reeling me in and then ignoring me for days. I think they liked how willing I was to direct all of my attention toward them and I was fascinated by how creative yet detached from the world they were. It was awful- do not recommend hahah
2	Posting about entps again i see :) i stand by my opinion that theyre annoying.
1	How do you FEEL about ENTPs... FTFY
1	Can you give some character examples of enfp?
1	My brother is an ENTP lol He has his moments of being extremely dislikable, but he also has extremely sweet moments. In my hyper moments we both talk a lot, go in adventures, or watch tv. I just know that wecan't spend too much time around together or we'll get into in argument. Hanging with him once a week is about as much as I can take since we have such different outlooks on life, but I love him.
1	Yes, we can see right through them, and they're so fucking rude. The guy I know acts like he's in the mafia after he watches too many gangster movies. When I first met him, I fucking hated him, but now I pretty much fuckin love him. We have a lot in common, he's just more extraverted, and that's really fun, and takes me out of my shell! At first glance, he seems really pretentious, but I mean, we are too, just on the inside. And he's so loyal, he will fucking defend me until the end when he thinks someone is messing with me or giving me a hard time. If he was a girl, I'd kiss him. Yeah I think he's just playful and doesn't take life too seriously so he acts however and says whatever he wants, which is I think how we all wanna be, right?
1	I have 2 entp professors and they are one of the most amusing ones. 
21	I really REALLY dislike people who have no concept of boundaries/personal space. They get all up in your face, etc. What's your reaction to these people?	by the way, even if I know the person or they're family members, I still hate it.
7	The only two things that I HATE is when someone in my family doesn't knock the door and I'm changing clothes, and when I'm on discord talking with someone and another person makes noise or even talk, making the people on discord listen to them.
3	I get really defensive and start to hold grudges if they continue to invade my space. If I get fed up enough, I will confront them about it. 
1	Depending how in my face they are. Like if they stop their car and start telling at me because I honked when they cut me off, I smile and nod until they realize what they are doing. If they are like, why don't know take the trash out, I get defensive 
1	There is one older guy who every day would bother me when I was eating my dinner. He would come right up to me and say "how's it goin?!" very intrusively. And every time, I would ignore him, and wait for him to leave. Needless to say, he did not get the hint. He would just stare at me and wait as if I'm supposed to respond to him, who is essentially a stranger. Honestly he gave me the CREEPS like no one else, that's why I wouldn't talk to him, aside from the extreme intrusiveness/crudeness/social ineptitude.\n\nIf that's not a nightmare for us, idk what is.
3	when dealing with an ISFP, is it good to encourage opening up and when is it good to leave well enough alone?	I am an ENFJ dating an ISFP and while I hear Fe and Fi can clash, I really like being the one to initiate and encourage communication. I just worry about crossing lines sometimes. of course everyone is different, but where do you guys draw the line?
7	It's hard to say, I personally don't know myself well enough to pinpoint where that line is. But I think the person you're dating would respond well if you asked them this directly. I don't know how comfortable you are with playing it by ear like that, but as an ISFP I would appreciate that kind of vulnerability. Maybe it would encourage them to respond in kind
2	It's a balance. You'll want to give the ISFP a prod, then back off for a bit to let them sort out their thoughts, then if they don't decide to approach you, lead by example then start from the top.  \nFor me, if I don't talk to someone for a week, it just becomes less and less likely that I'll approach them, depending on how close we are.   \n\n\nISFP's don't like to be pressured or put on the spot, so instead of focusing on having them attempt to say whatever's on their mind, focus on giving them a situation or environment where they'll feel comfortable doing so.   \nIf I can comfortably sit in silence with someone, eventually I'll work out some way to articulate what I want to say to them. Often I'd be more than happy to open up to someone, if only I had the time and space to work out how to do so.
15	I often go to Walmart in the middle of the night. There is a 3rd shift ISFP door greeter. He's retiring and tonight is his last night.	I want to get him a retirement gift. Any thoughts?
6	Very nice socks 
6	Quality coffee
2	A dog
5	Do ISFPs have a tendency to push people away?	I am an ESFJ (25F) exclusively dating an ISFP (29M) for about six months until he broke it off with me yesterday because I pushed the subject of commitment. There’s a bit of history in my posts if you need some background info.\n\nI feel like he genuinely cares for me but he is really confused about his life and isn’t treating me the best. He seems stuck in a rut and I have been using MBTI to try understand and help him but I don’t know how I can help him if he keeps shutting me out. I knew he was introverted and needed his space, I didn’t need labels from him and while I wasn’t forcing ‘commitment’ with me, I wanted him to understand I didn’t need labels but I do need security and stability which he wasn’t providing.\n\nHe broke it off with after that conversation because he couldn’t commit. He tells me he likes me a lot but I don’t know how much of it is he just doesn’t like me enough or if he’s actually going through something like he keeps telling me but is pushing me away to avoid dealing with it.\n\nHe wants to remain friends and that we could revisit in a few months when he sorts himself out. I was visibly upset, I thought it was cruel considering he has apologised for his behaviour in the past saying ‘(I) am a complete d\*\*\*head, I would be a damn fool to not chase after you.’\n\nIn spite of all this I am concerned for him and really wanted to help but I don’t know what else I can do. I’m also a bit heartbroken because even after all this, a part of me is still trying to look for solutions. I don’t want him to punish himself over this.\n\nHow much of this is genuine ISFP needing help or is he just stuffing me around? Would waiting for him to magically pop out of his shell one day been as fruitless as having conversations about commitment? I’m at a loss.
7	Yes. They are avoidant people. They are extreme loners. They can go for years without dating anyone. \n\n
6	Sounds like me a bit. My advice is to tell him how nice your future will be and that you want to build something with him. \n\nI'm not afraid of commitment, I'm afraid of commitment with the wrong person. Maybe he is like that too.
3	How long have y’all been dating? Just because he’s an ISFP doesn’t mean he’s the same as me, but I like things to go very slowly in relationships. I don’t want to be vulnerable and have strong feelings for someone until there’s a strong emotional attachment. I’m relaxed about flings, but long term relationships freak me out. I need to have known the person for awhile. 
2	When people get into relationships (specifically men) their priorities must change. And Especially when "commitment" comes up. You focus on them and not yourself \n\nHe probably is scared about his personality changing. For me at least love is synonymous with sacrifice and that changes somebody. It's a life changing experience that you cannot back out of. (Mentally and legally)\n\nIt's a huge risk, especially with the 50% divorce rate nowadays and the suicide statistics for men afterwards\n\nNOT saying that is what would happen, but how would you know if it works out until you try? Then it's to late.\n\nIt seems like you were getting along and he liked that. A commitment (marriage) would change things. Otherwise why would it exist?\n\nHe probably won't change. And I sympathize. \n\nIt sucks that you are learning this now but it's my best asessmnt as to what's happening.
1	I'm a INFJ and dated a ISFP and the same thing happened. He did the same thing to me. Now he was a gf. 
1	Yeah I'm fine thank you. I guess I don't have much advice for you sorry. 
1	his head tellng him he's a fool about this, but his feelings don't line up.

8	ENFP here - what is the actual difference between iSFP and INTJ? I'm confused about my platonic-ish crush.	This will be so ENFP of me, but I have been trying to type my crush for about six months and I'm quite unable to - mostly because he's two different people onstage and offstage.\n\nBefore anything else - he is not necessarily a celebrity, most people don't know him by name and we know each other.\n\nSome starting points that contradict one another\n\n- He's an incredible performer, a show-off.\n\n- He's a multinstrumentalist. Can play basically anything.\n\n- He's a great singer.\n\n- He's a pretty straightforward lyricist - all stuff love-related, simple, if not shallow. Naive-ish.\n\n- He's very physical towards me, the first man I didn't hit when he touched me randomly. Hugs me tightly, kisses me.\n\n- He is not necessarily physical with most other people.\n\n- He is not a drug user, rarely ever drinks a full can or bottle of beer and I saw him smoke two cigarettes in an occasion where he was super-nervous.\n\n- He is quite a dresser. Like, I don't know that much about clothes and shoes and I'm a woman.\n\n- He's very cerebral - has two university degrees in seemingly unrelated fields. HOWEVER, one of those two was what his parents wanted from him, his mother's profession.\n\n- He's been quite persistent about one of his projects, which people pretty much discredited at first.\n\n- He's approachable and kind to everybody, but he never posted anything personal on Facebook, rarely ever reveals something that's not professional. I was surprised when I went to see if he was okay after a show where he had voice problems and he revealed that he needs a vacation and is taking a random one, in a quiet village.\n\n- When we reunited after a long time I spent thinking he did something he never did (his friend insulted me, not him...), he was somewhat guarded before I apologised, but even then he was nice. The moment I said I was sorry, I could literally feel his guard drop.\n\n- He has long-term future plans. I, err, have none.\n\n- He has an adopted child, which is a very, very rare thing here.\n\n- He talks a lot and knows a lot about many things - both music-wise and otherwise. His vocabulary is great.\n\n- He doesn't force his opinion on people\n\n- His expressions often don't match what he's doing or saying - e.g. he'd be happy to see me and have a resting bitch face. He'd suddenly go all awkward during a live show while somebody else is talking and look down, giggling.\n\n- In all groups of people, the one who dominates the conversation and talks most.\n\n- Sometimes he has these power trips going on and it comes across when he assures people that everybody in the band is an equal and then talks about how he wanted to have creative control over everything.\n\n- There is literally no dirt about him - another reason I'm surprised so as to why he is seemingly returning my affections. That makes me wonder where his Fi is.\n\n- Huge eater. Doesn't really have a refined taste.\n\n- A hard worker, dedicated. Has family, currently the only breadwinner.\n\n- For those who believe this is related: stocky build, round face, large eyes, weight going up and down, but nothing that could be seen as thin or overweight at any point. High kinesthetic intelligence, ambidextrous. Delicate and gentle mannerisms when not in-character and/or onstage.\n\nThanks in advance. :)
5	Neither ISFP, nor INTJ
5	What makes you think he's an INTJ? I hear lots of SP vibes from this.
2	Yeah I get 0 INTJ. But your descriptions seem to be based on descriptions of type. Look into cognitive functions.
1	Sounds like ENFJ
1	Can be a very healthy/mature ISTP. 
1	Stoping looking at the surface, MBTI isn’t about behavior, but cognition. INTJs messer the world first through examining there own thought patterns and coming up with theory’s about themselves, and through that, the world around them. Not there own logic. There own though patterns. They also use it to come up with large, wholistic, theory’s and plans. ISFPs first and foremost take in there own feelings, and observe that, and try and figure out what they value from that. ISFPs are judging dominant. There first instinct is to say “thing good” or “thing bad”, “thing right” or “thing wrong” based solely of there internal feelings. INTJs are perceiving dominate  so they primarily take in the world without judging it. However this is just there first function. INTJs have Te as there second function. This leads them to want to implement/test there ideas in a real world logical context, or to pull evidence from the real world. ISFPs Secondary function is Se witch let’s them take in the world as it really is, having a strong sense of there physical soundings. They experience  sensory things very strongly and in a fair amount of detail.  Then there are the third functions. For INTJ I’m strong emotions. There not particularly adept at using them but there most certainly there! ISFPs have Ni as there third function. There not generally gunna spend a lot of time watching there own thoughts, or coming up with theory’s but can if they got to with a reasonable  amount of successes.  Then there’s the last functions. For INTJ it’s Se. They often struggle to act in the moment and struggle with the fact that “the first casualty in any battle  is the plan.” Heck sometimes they don’t even manage to get to the point where they can act, because they can’t manage to get of there buts and do the plan. For ISFPs I think (based on limited experience) that they mostly come out with criticism. They will often take arguments against them, or even constructive  criticism  of there work very personally. There unable to detach external logic from internal feelings s 
24	ISFP with social anxiety	So, I have an ISFP personality type, obviously. I was wondering if anyone else here has had to cope with social anxiety and/or depression. It's really frustrating, I'm already quite shy, and I want to make friends and hang out, but I'm too damn scared to talk to people. No one ever initiates conversation with me. I consider myself quite approachable. I don't look at my phone much when walking around or sitting down, I almost never have headphones in, I keep my head up, I smile a bit, I don't cross my arms. It's even harder to talk to people when they're always looking at their phones or computers, listening to music, are talking to someone else, or have a very unfriendly look on their face. I also suck at talking to people when they're in a group(that shit's intimidating). I feel like I need some sort of "excuse" to talk to people, or they'll think I'm weird for talking to them for no reason. I have some valid excuses for talking to some people, like I've been trying to work up the courage to ask this girl if she wants to study together, but she's always with her friends and like I said, that's pretty intimidating to me. Yeah she's pretty cute, but I'm trying to make friends, and I think this would be a pretty good opportunity. I'm fairly certain she'll say no, because she asked if I wanted to study with her one weekend, and I obviously said yes. She said she wasn't sure when, so I said she could come by any time( we live on the same floor). Well surprise surprise she never stopped by, which I find rather odd because she asked me, but whatever,  there's a reason I don't set my expectations very high. And I did really well on the test anyways. I'm not mad at her. Like it is what it is, I just find it kind of strange. That's besides the point, and I have another excuse which is pretty strong but i feel like she'd see right through it. \n\nI know people my age get annoyed when older people say phones make people anti social, but damn, they definitely aren't wrong. I guess the phone thing was a culture shock because phones weren't allowed during the school day, and what do you know, people talked to each other.  But anyways I've gone way off topic (did I mention I have ADD?)  but how should I, a shy, introverted, socially anxious, weird, first year college student make friends when no one is open to conversation? \n\nAlso not helping my situation is the fact that I am currently without a roommate.\n\nTL;DR- How should a weird, shy, introverted, socially anxious first year college student(18m btw) make friends when no one wants to talk?
9	Idk but I’m in the same boat so you’re not alone man.
7	I understand many of the points you shared, especially the intimidation with groups. I guess the root of your problem is your lack of confidence. You're already making yourself available, even tried to reach out to someone once, these are good baby steps to making friends. Unfortunately, so many people nowadays can't process (or refuse to) read very subtle social cues anymore because we're always "sort of busy"--i.e., with our phones, with the music only we can hear, etc. I get frustrated with this too. Like you, I keep my head up, wear a friendly face and not use my phone when I'm in social situations or even just in public spaces. But rarely do I meet someone who'll put their phone down to notice the presence of other people around them.\n\nSo if other people can't recognize subtle social cues, try to step up your game. Say hi to more people, share tables with strangers, speak more often even if it drives you nuts on the inside. All these are possible when you build up your confidence. Try to practice speaking in front of the mirror, make a list of topics you'll be ready to talk about anytime, and be kinder to yourself.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being shy, introverted and socially anxious. So many of us are too. I'm 26 and I still use those words to describe myself as well, but when I want to make new connections, even if it really makes me anxious (as in my palms would sweat profusely), I just take the leap. Just say hi.
4	Boy, just be confident. It isn't easy, it's weird af at first. Teach yourself different cultural customs. Try going to a gym? You'll find other people maybe work out buddies, AND! you'll be moving to have a more healthy/appeasing figure. Plus it feels great to be strong, to be able to help anyone who asks. Learn to love yourself. Don't go full up your own ass but learn and accept what you suck at, and don't. Believe in yourself and stand tall. Women and men respect sure people. Maybe that girl isn't interested, or is also afraid. Don't sweat it, don't push it, and move on. There are billions of people on earth and you found person right, right down the street? Go play the lottery because that's lucky af.
3	She was probably unsure with a vague answer like “anytime”. If you put a time on it, even a range like 5-7pm, they’ll feel an obligation to come at that time. \n\nIn other words, she might’ve been just as shy and anxious.
2	If you accept your 'flaws', social anxiety decreases.\nA good exercise is looking at other people's 'flaws' and then using compassion to dissolve judgements. Like if I initially thought you were weak for having anxiety. I could dissolve this judgement by realizing that you're simply another human being yearning for connection (like everyone).\nNow use the compassion towards your negative thoughts. \nAlso, exercise and healthy eating does wonders. \n
1	Well I'm INFP and I've been plagued with a sense of wariness of others for basically all my life;  males with this type are known to be socially anxious to one degree or another, so I get that. It's not so much the "anxiety" part that is a major issue for me, it's the fear,  the reservation, and the apprehension. My advice, would be to sit near a group of people who you think are decent at college, and hope they'll talk to you first, and then go from there; that's how I did it in college and work anyway, and it's always worked for me.  You know, you've gotta talk to me first if you want to talk to me at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA friend of mine, which I'm fairly sure is ISFP, used to have similar issues to you especially when starting new jobs, but this subsided and now he has several other work friends and gets on alright with others from what he's told me, so if you're anything like him, it could go away with experience. Another guy I know with this personality type used to have it, yet still manages to go to real-world  'meets' with others which is beyond me. Neither of these people seem to be super concerned about what others think of them, where as for me and other individuals with this type this is pretty much a given.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to downplay it, but I think the type of social phobia ISFP and INFP's have is somewhat different. Since learning about MBTI and typing people around me, it's like every INFP I know fits the online description of being "quiet, reserved (at first), and sensitive", it's like we'll always be the "*quiet one*" in the eyes of others, no matter what, like everywhere we go. Dunno if this'll help but I'm just sharing my experience.
1	Im INTP and have Social Anxiety too
3	What is your job (or career that you are pursuing)?	I'm a senior in High School. I've been thinking about becoming a Neonatal NP because I love kids and want a job where I can help people and is pretty hands-on (not just sitting at a desk all day lol), but I'm starting to have doubts. I've always kind of struggled in school... I get decent grades, but nothing exceptional enough to get into a really good school (3.2 unweighted, 3.5 weighted). School has always been difficult because, though I am fairly intelligent, I CANNOT stay focused and am unbelievably disorganized/constantly turn stuff in late. I'm not sure that a career requiring a Masters is very realistic for me. Also, I'm interested in health sciences/biology, but suck at math and get bored with sciences that aren't related to living things, so I'm not sure a medical degree would be the best suit for me anyways. What do you guys do for a living? What did you major in? How did you decide on it, and do you like what you do? 
5	Well I'm studying 3D animation and VFX, and I want to specialize in modelling or character design. I think you should pursue a career that makes you fullfilled as a person, no matter how hard it is. If it's sciences, then work hard for it, you'll enjoy it. Better be 8 years studying than 50 years working on something you don't love when you could have done better to yourself.
3	I always regretted not pursuing marine biology.
2	  I work retail now, but I'm studying to become a personal trainer. I've lately been thinking about becoming a graphic designer, because art was my main interest in high school and it's something I care about a lot more than fitness(though I work out 6x a week and am in good shape), and also would find more fun. \n\nI went to a community college and dropped out, but I was planning on studying German if I transferred to a university. That probably will never happen so I'm just keeping my interest in language an interest & hobby. I was also a pretty average student in HS, but did terribly in math and that's part of why I never succeeded at CC, which is basically a repeat of HS in terms of required subjects. \n\nI've also thought about joining the military, but I have poor eyesight and a few things wrong with my legs so I might not. I'll probably just try a bunch of stuff until I find something that I like and that makes enough money
7	Anybody think they’re more interesting than they actually are?	Do you think you’re pretty boring? Aside from being moody I don’t think there’s a whole lot to there, if you follow me. 
15	Yes. This might sound pretty narcissistic but I think I’m an interesting person although I might not seem that way. I feel like I have many layers within myself and that I’m a deep, complex character. I like to analyze myself, why I am the way I am, why I act the way I acted, what ticks me, what motivates me etc probably due to my strong Fi. \n\nBut then again I’m pretty sure everyone is complex and everyone has layers and they all have a story to tell. 
7	If I stepped outside of my shoes and observed myself, I would say that I'm boring, if I was not myself. But if I stepped outside of my shoes and observed myself while still being myself, I would still hangout with myself. Who wouldn't want to hangout with someone that is exactly like them? That's just too awesome. \n\nTLDR: I'm boring, but I would still hangout with myself if there was another me.
5	I think I’m probably more interesting than I give myself credit for. I often feel like I don’t really have a personality, just an obession with music and bad focus. Of course that doesn’t really make sense, but it doesn’t stop it from being how I come across to myself.\n\nI’ve tried writing this in a way that makes sense a few times, lol. It doesn’t really make sense to me either though. :P
3	Yesterday I asked to my friends (in a game of awkward questions) who was the most emotional person of all of us, and they said me, that I'm a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nSo I guess that's the interesting part of me? They also said I'm so stressful I stress people around me.\n\nI don't think I'm very interesting aside from my hobbies (drawing and gaming huh...)
2	I feel the same way outside of my personality (depending on my mood) I don't think I have a specific characteristics that makes me interesting.
2	I almost feel the opposite. I think I'm insanely boring, but my friends make comments about me being 'the fun one' and such, so maybe its just my cripplingly low self esteem lol.
2	Nah i know im very not interesting.
2	I'm mostly boring to other people ( it's noticeable ). But alone I can have fun, just not with other people. I can tell I'm pretty boring to some people in conversation and in general :p
1	i mean people think I'm intriguing but by those standards most people must be f\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* boring bro.
5	Have you ever experienced a "moral wound," and how did you deal?	My ISFP husband is trying to heal a moral wound. I'm not sure he'd be comfortable with me posting the details here. However, it involved making a life-changing relationship decision together, which Dear Hubby (DH) later came to regret/resent me for, and then used as a long-term justification for cheating on me. That infidelity stopped about 12 months ago, but for DH the pain and guilt hasn't passed. For the most part, DH carries this all as a silent pain, but I feel a lot of empathy for him, and quietly carry the pain alongside him. He struggles to discuss it with his therapist, even though he actively wants to work on it with them.\n\nLooking back, he can see better decisions he could have made to be less hurtful to the people he loves. While I think he could have made better choices, I've forgiven him for what he did. There is still a solid friendship between us, including moments of deep love and a sense of respect. If I have a frustration, it is only that this moral wound holds him back from rebuilding with me. If I have a fear, it is that DH will officially decide he isn't worthy of his own forgiveness. I'm not sure what he'll become, if that's the case...\n\nHave you ever inflicted yourself or an important relationship with a moral wound? How did you find your way out of the darkness?
6	ISFPs don’t tend to hold grudges. If I resent someone who isn’t actively causing a problem (or refusing to fix one) it’s because I’ve decided they can’t be trusted in some regard. Since ISFPs typically defer to their partner’s judgement when doing...well, almost anything...he might blame you for the decision you guys made together? Perhaps in his mind, he trusted you to make the important decision and you chose poorly. \n\nAnother likely situation is that you remind him of the trauma and even though he loves you, he is fighting the urge to “cut and run” so he doesn’t have to deal with it anymore. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nNeither of these situations is fair toward you but you are dealing with a special kind of logic, one pretty much designed to protect his feelings. You’d be surprised what he could justify if he hurts enough. Maybe not though, since you mentioned he cheated :/
16	You'll never stop me...	
2	lol!!
2	Is this from Mad magazine? That looks like Tom Richmond’s artwork on the right.
16	How expressive are you?	For a long time, I was sure that I was a T type, because I’m not very outwardly expressive. But looking more into the functions I realised that Fi is waaaaay more accurate for me than Ti. I still don’t really express myself visibly often, in fact sometimes it feels like I’m acting my real emotions like a play, just to show people that I appreciate something, because if I just let a natural reaction happen I would look uncaring for it.\n\nSo is this an ISFP thing? I think it might be an Fi thing in general.
16	It’s because you’re so concerned with being authentic (dominant Fi) that you focus too much on whether emotions you show are fake or forced, and then you just shut down to prevent coming across as a phony.\n\nGet out of your head. I think the most genuine ISFP emotions are shown in the moment and almost always in person: abrupt laughter, a spontaneous hug, a blush, etc.
6	Well I tend to be expressive with my face a lot, but I also feel like I'm acting with some people. Maybe it's just the level of confidence.
3	For me, I think it depends on how "invested" i am, maybe.\n\nI can appear to not care (I think), and then, strangely, about certain things? .....  pump-the-breaks overcare.\n\nBut I get what you're saying
9	INTP here looking for advice on how to befriend you elusive ISFPs :)	My best friend's girlfriend is ISFP.  I live in a house with both him and her.  She's also a close friend of mine, and we go way back, buttttt our friendship can go from perfectly healthy to strained in a matter of minutes.  We're on great terms overall, but when we're alone, there's a slightly awkward subtext that feels like "*we don't get along, we're different*".  I try to bend over backwards to keep her happy and to avoid offending her, but it seems like I always inevitably piss her off or alienate her (e.g. sometimes with crude humor or sometimes by discussing philosophy/science/tech too much).  **Any advice for how I can offend her less and speak in a way that's more relatable to her?**\n\nMy current thinking is that I need to stop trying to make her happy and just *listen* to her feelings (Fi) without trying to change them.  I also need to give her space at times, instead of trying to aggressively build rapport (which I'm prone to doing with those in my inner circle of friends).\n\nThanks in advance! 
12	> Any advice on how I can offend her less and speak in a way that’s more relatable to her?\n\nISFPs are about actions, not words.\n\nYou won’t be comfortable having the kinds of conversations she wants to have, unless you’re into baring your soul and discussing your life and analyzing your feelings with her.\n\nBarring that, that you would be better off engaging in activities with her that don’t require much conversation.\n\nIf she’s athletic, maybe bond through something physical. If she’s artistic, maybe go to crafts fairs or something.\n\n
6	Do you know what media she likes? Binge all of it and have a critique ready. 
5	look at having more open ended convos instead of a focus on being right or the opportunity to display intellect. \n\nrealize the same way you view logic is the same way she probably view feelings. her logic is feelings. 
2	You can also try /r/mbtirelationships for further advice! 
2	I'm an ISFP and even though this doesn't really have to do with your situation it might help. My boyfriend is an INTP and going into that knowing this information kind of made me think we would struggle, but we honestly don't. As an ISFP i get bored when he is talking about stuff i don't understand (especially tech things cause i'm honestly only half listening and half looking at the swoop in his hair) so it makes sense that your friends girlfriend doesn't really engage when you are talking about. my advice is to find a way to possibly combine your interests into a deep conversation. I'm more on the artistic side so maybe talk about a cool sculpture you saw and theorize on how they made it. she might have some information on it you never knew about. once you get an ISFP talking about something they really like its pretty hard to get them uninterested. 
4	MBTI and Wholeheartedness	Hi Everyone,\n\nThis survey is entirely anonymous. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if you don't like your answers.\n\n[CLICK HERE FOR SURVEY](https://goo.gl/forms/jbXVEyrSwhedbK3C3)\n\nI'm really interested in Brene Brown's work on shame, vulnerability and wholeheartedness. I've noticed that, while MBTI focuses on highlighting our strengths, the discussions in many MBTI communities seem to focus on the struggle to overcome flaws or struggles with vulnerability. It seems that we're all drawn here to tinker around inside our behaviors, understand something important about ourselves, or understand the way we interact with the world. I'm wondering (informally, this is just for fun) if there's a pattern to MBTI personality types, and ease of wholeheartedness/living with courage.\n\nSo, I made this quick survey. Enjoy!(?)\n\nBonus Question: What socially or emotionally vulnerable experience has done the most to define your identity?
2	Interesting survey. I dunno how google surveys work, but with some of these questions I bet there will be more of a gender difference than a personality difference, if you are able to check that. Will you post a comment on this thread when you’ve got your results to enlighten us? c:\n\nAlso for the bonus question: I don’t want to say too much about it, but it had to do with a friend considering suicide, and we both learned a lot about each other.
1	Any results so far? 
6	How do you act when you are sad?	
32	I don't talk to anyone and spend time feeling sorry for myself, and then spend time feeling like an idiot for spending so long feeling sorry for myself.
12	Go radio silent and will do anything to be alone because I have the inability to show/feel my sadness in front of most people
11	i act like i’m okay with everyone around me but when i’m alone i look back on whatever i’m sad about and get even more sad lol
4	Sports.
3	Crawl into my bed and go into a deep slumber. Then wake up in the middle of the night and become even more sad that I wasted the day away.
4	A sub for relationship advice specific to MBTI!	
2	Angela Rummans on Big Brother 20: ISFP	Anybody notice that Angela on BB20 is an ISFP? Her business involves making/selling artistic stuff on etsy. She's a former elite gymnast and pole vaulter (athletic). She said she has huge walls/boulders against developing romantic relationships and that whoever can get past them deserves a lot of credit and she hadn't had a boyfriend for years before BB20 (in spite of being beautiful).  
1	[deleted]
1	None of that makes her an ISFP.
19	What are you like when angry?	So, about an hour ago or so, my boss at my internship (ESTP) flipped out at me in a really nasty passive-aggressive way for browsing reddit (which is odd, since he never minds it, and I've been working all day) at the last 5 minutes of the day. This kind of behavior kinda scares me at first, but once it's over I'm the one who gers angry. \n\nSo, that got me thinking, everyone seems to have certain habits when they are angry. My boss calmly, but in a really serious tone basically asks you "what are you doing?" and then once you give him an answer he pretty much verbally tears you apart in a passive-aggressive way, and tells you to continue your work. In my case, I am usually in some sort of shock at first, I get shaky and I'm some sort of scared, and after that I get really grumpy and start having thoughts in which I'm beating up the one I'm angry at, or think of ways to get revenge. I also pretty much completely ignore them when they say something, unless it's important, in which case I just reply curt and professionally. Outside of that, I try not too look grumpy or angry, because in my experience that will just make them point it out and continue harassing you. I can't muster a happy face either, so I just settle for a neutral face.
16	I've noticed some of the other personality types have no issue blowing up at you and then the next day it's like it never happened. That's the part that bothers me. Don't act fake with me if you have beef with me! And while I respect authority and care what my superiors think, I don't like being snapped at or micromanaged (who does, really?). The thing is, sometimes they're not being fake — they just get over it quickly. I, as an ISFP, don't get over it quickly! I want to talk about it. I want to find the solution. I want to get back in their favor. For example, in your case, I'd be happy to have a conversation privately with my boss and explain myself. I would want to be understood and not have the worst assumed about me. I'd want them to see my heart and I'd want to relieve tension. I don't like being blown up at because it makes me resentful and I analyze the relationship obsessively. I'll begin to hold a grudge. I don't like burying things!
8	I react pretty much the same as you. I don't show it much, but people feel the angry tension around me. I get very shaky, I sometimes get teary eyes, but I mostly mutter to myself and bottle it up until I can't anymore and I hurt myself either physically or by ruminating. (It's not a healthy way to cope, but I haven't been that angry in a long time)
9	i dont get mad a lot, i’m usually able to control myself. but when i get mad i get like mad MAD lol. i usually come off as a different person like i’m usually kind and willing to agree to disagree but when i’m mad it’s the complete opposite and i become pretty aggressive in my tone
5	For me it takes a lot to get me really angry. I don't like to waste my energy getting worked up when I can calmly acknowledge it and move on. I like to think I'm a pretty patient person. When I do get angered especially in a heated argument I'm probably going to be crying because I'm SUPER sensitive. In therapy I learned that my personal anger styles are:\nHidden styles\n• Avoidance "I don't get angry"\n• Sneaky "you can't make me"\nExplosive styles\n• Sudden anger "I have a short fuse"\nChronic styles \n• Moral anger "I fight for what is right"\n\nI've also never experienced wanting to seek vengeance and I don't think I would ever want to have revenge no matter the circumstances. I've never wanted to hurt anyone, not even when it might come natural in ones head when someone has really made them angry. \nI'm someone who needs to communicate and compromise in relationships, so when I'm in a fight its important to me to find that common ground. \nThe worst fights I've ever had are with my mom, she is someone who gets under my skin and fires back whatever she wants to win an argument and to make you feel smaller if you've said something that has hurt her. With her it's super hard for me to turn away  right when things start fusing. I've gotten better but she is the only person who has ever made me that angry, its probably why I hate getting angry in the first place.
5	I let it fester and grow until I can’t hold it and I make a very bad social mistake. \n\nBeen keeping an eye out on that and either try to down it out or confront it before my feelings get out of hand. 
3	Reading comments here helped me feel a little better about my anger “issues” (let’s be honest here, it’s not an issue, it’s everyone else who keeps stepping on toes with the issues). Normally I’m approachable, kind of goofy, not-taking-things-seriously kind of way, but I take pride in my work and see that it gets done.\n\nAdmittedly sometimes this somehow hints to my (ex-)boss that he can push and demand as he pleases, and I do try to accommodate these things as much and as best I can. Till he gets in my face and throws blame around. I let him have it, cranked up to 11.\n\nI wasn’t fired though, he didn’t want to talk to me and couldn’t look me in the eyes even in the hallways. But damage done, everyone was afraid, even my coworkers, whom I never once lashed out at. I left on my own accord eventually. Still, I don’t think it’s a problem since it’s how I processed breaking point anger, and everything before that was reasonable if not beyond so. All the advice I’ve sought since is more to do with letting people know I’m stressed out by signalling that, you know, before I tear into someone. But it’s so very difficult, I only have two settings of “fun” and “unreasonably angry”.
1	I am an isfp also and usually when i am angry in general i tend to be passive aggressive but if i am extrememly angry and had the anger for a long time i become outwardly aggressive. My preferred attack in this state is verbal because if i feel a certain way i want the world to know about it especially the people i am mad at. Theres only been two times i remember in recent years that i reached an extreme state and it is not a good place to be. It's similar to the severe "under the grip" stress because it makes you take on negative traits of ENTJ which is the complete opposite of ISFP but you may have to be under the influence of other things such as a stressful event like sudden homelessness, no support group, etc. to have this happen to you but everyone is different.
1	I pretty much warn people to stay away because I know I can get pretty scary when I get mad. I will get physical, my sense sharped and I will start directly cursing at you with no mercy. People labeled me as a hothead Lol. I would try to calm down by deep breathes or take a lap around the school tho but most of the time I would get more angrier 🤦‍♀️\nLol and yes I did flicked a girl off because she pissed me off when she keep telling me to get off the game about 5-6, she put her anger on me when it's just a hockey game and I was a newbie. My friend tried to calm me saying "No harsh feelings, it's just a game." And I would cool a little. But, I was enjoying the game so I didn't care about winning or losing. When she could have did the right thing and try to teach newbies. Eventually she tried to bully me lol saying "haha you guys keep losing-" That's when I lose it for real and I smacked her with the hockey stick hard on her hip and told her to f*ck off. And her expression was priceless, close like this ---> :O She think that I won't DO IT. I wasn't done there, I also reported her to the teachers and she was apologetic, scared to say it to my face. What a bad sport. Now she is just ignoring me as much as possible. I don't blame her. :/
0	I need a little help.	There's a kid that I really wanna speak to, but I can barely speak to the kid. Heck, it's even hard for me to even look at the kid. Anyone know any tips for trying to speak to the kid?
5	Text the kid
1	I believe in you, why can't you look at the kid?
1	Am i the kid?
12	How are you guys with flirting??	I absolutely suck at flirting. I’m a chronically platonic person, and treat those I’m attracted to with the exact same general friendliness I show every one else. I’m almost 18 and have never even been on a date, and tend to get spooked/creeped out when guys clearly hit on me. I had a crush on this dude, but found out one of my best friends liked him, so I definitely set them up and they’re going on a date this weekend. I’m honestly fine with it because she had no way of knowing how I felt and I certainly wasn’t going to act on it, knowing myself. Plus they’re pretty cute together! But do any of you kind of stuggle with flirting/showing interest in others?? Or, if you don’t, how have you gotten past your introversion?
13	TE\n\nRR\n\nIB\n\nLE
9	If I like someone I don't have a problem flirting and sending hidden messages. The problem is when I don't like them, it's like a 0 to 100 feeling. I want to give the people I love a good experience/feeling you know?
7	26 male. feels sad man
4	So I never had a girlfriend until college and I'm married now. I'm a guy but in college I learned to flirt by being nice to everyone equally but to the girls I thought were cute I would work at when taking to them and make sure sure if small physical contact. 
5	Eye contact. Smiling. Smiling flatters and encourages men to be bolder. Be *genuinely* curious about them. Figure out what their interests and passions are and ask them questions about that topic. Ask more than just a couple things about that topic. Get in depth. Try to understand and learn something from them. It’ll take the nerves off if you see the conversation as a learning opportunity and help you to act more natural. Dead silence? Ask more questions. Family? Pets? What breed is your dog? Is the dog well behaved? Show me a photo! Does he like new people? Act impressed if something is impressive. “Woah, really?” “I would have never guessed!” Laugh at their jokes. That boosts ego and feel-good feelings. Don’t reveal everything at once. Be a little mysterious. Wait for him to ask questions about you. Share a bit about yourself too! Avoid negativity or gossip. Speak highly of other people. Keep your mouth shut about the people of whom you don’t want to speak highly. Read a bit. Keep up on the major current events. Have opinions. Express said opinions in a way that encourages agreement, but also diversity of thought if they don’t agree. Mild teasing can be a bit flirtatious and fun, but perhaps test that out to see if the person responds well to it or not. Don’t be a know-it-all. Let minor incorrect statements slide. Or find a humorous, non-naggy way to counter that statement. A touch on the arm or a hug can help.\n\nJust a few pointers. Maybe you do some of these things already. The biggest thing I find that helps is to not run out of questions. If you become genuinely interested in getting to know people, and people are very fascinating, you won’t run out of things to say to people. So, create a mindset of curiosity! Pretend you’re a journalist (but keep that to yourself, haha). \n\nAlthough, I will couch all of the above with this: if you’re trying these things out with someone and they’re not receptive, you should ask yourself whether it’s worth spinning your wheels on a one-way conversation. Do you actually still like them?
3	If someone initiates flirting with me, I am a little awkward. Usually I am open to considering dating anyone so that is not the issue, it's just switching into "flirtation" mood/mode.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I am attracted to someone I will be comfortable flirting unless they give confusing signals in return. Then I just stop, even when the most rational thing would be to say, "I like you, wanna go out?" and be respectful if they don't.
3	I have another comment too. Why did you set them up? You liked the guy. Maybe they would have ended up going on a date anyway, but didn’t you want a shot? You may have had a chance with him before, but you have less of a chance now because your friend may get in a relationship with him or maybe she won’t want any of her friends to date him if it doesn’t work out. He’s “claimed.” Sorry, not trying to condemn your actions. I just can empathize with you because I have done the same kinds of things when I was younger. And I realize I don't have all the details of your story -- I just hear 'I liked this person, but set them up with someone else...' And that hurts my heart!\n\nI know loyalty to friends is important, but you still can be just that without invalidating your own feelings. I wouldn’t voluntarily give up my chance with someone just because a friend spoke up first. Also, just a general piece of advice — be careful who you talk about crushes with. I know you didn’t tell this girl, but I would also be careful allowing friends in your circle to discuss their own crushes at length with you. Women and girls can act funny about available men. We get possessive and start “claiming” them. It can lead to a lot of hurt feelings, stress, and unnecessary competition. Oh and it’s really awesome when some women like every guy and start "calling dibs" on all of them (*sarcasm*)...then who's left for you if she's interested in ten dudes? Just be choosy about who you talk about such things with. Maybe there’s someone from another school or a friend who lives out of state you can talk to about your crushes and vice versa... that way you're not risking overlap of romantic interest. Or even your mom who can’t date your demographic, haha! That last one depends on your relationship, obviously. \n\nI’m 32, and all this is said with much love and experience. :)
3	Favourite books, movies, music.	Dear fellow ISFPs.\n\nWhat are your favourite books, music and movies? Doesn’t have to be MBTI related. Just your personal favourites. Don’t feel like you have limit yourself to a couple. Write a whole list if you must. Thanks. ❤️
4	Book - The Bridge of San Luis Rey\n\nMusic - Tchaikovsky is my most consistent favorite, other music preferences come and go\n\nMovie - Waking Life. Also The Tree of Life is a great sensory movie
5	Just being real- I don’t really like reading, I get bored lol. I did love To Kill a Mockingbird, and I loved the Hunger Games series when I was younger. For music I’m kind of all over the place, and like just about everything except for country, and maybe grunge rock. Some of my favorite musicians are:\nKendrick Lamar\nKanye -I know, shame on me:(\nBon Iver\nPost Malone (his first album mostly)\nLil Wayne\nXxxTentacion\nThe lumineers\nThe chainsmokers\nBruno Major\nVance Joy (his first album, I hate the second one with a passion)\nKings of Leon\nCage the Elephant\nDeclan Mckenna\nRainbow Kitten Surprise\nG EAZY (almost forgot him!)\nDrake\nRuss\nCaamp \nThe Beatles\nLil dicky\nCardi B\nA lot of worship music lol\nKhalid\nMatt Corby\nLeon Bridges\nWet\nColdplay\nKodaline\n... I could honestly go on way longer, but I won’t ;). But yeah- it’s just kind of all over the place. I don’t really like movies tbh, and mostly stick to sitcoms (in the style of The Office, B99, etc.)
4	Music: my favorite band is The Black Keys, and my favorite song is Stairway to Heaven. Book: JD Salinger's "The Cather in the Rye". Movie: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

2	Ooh I’ve been recommended Confederancy of Dunces. 😬
2	I made a playlist with songs I like that happen to be in line with the isfp personality type: [https://open.spotify.com/user/11144975262/playlist/22OwNyo1xflo4hZMCNNE7Y?si=3UWO7eXXRq6muq4qIirgxA](https://open.spotify.com/user/11144975262/playlist/22OwNyo1xflo4hZMCNNE7Y?si=3UWO7eXXRq6muq4qIirgxA)

35	I love autumn.	The cool breeze. The colors. Memories...\n\nI treasure it every year. I could do nothing but sit in a park or walk around for a couple months.
13	Me too except for it gets dark too fast
8	Sweater weather!
2	Definitely my least favorite season of the year. \n\nCold, but not cold enough to justify comfy clothes. \n\nUgly colors, dead trees, crappy weather, etc. \n\nGive me spring, summer or winter any day.
2	My favorite season! <3
1	I do too. It holds such good memories for me. You should try mushroom picking and identification since this is the time of year. :)
9	Anyone here who has tried being a professional Jack/Jill of all trades?	I mean like, leaving one job after being in it for some years then switching to a totally different one, even better if in a different industry, then rinse and repeat. What was that like? How did it go for you?\n\nI figured it might be good to ask fellow ISFPs because we're the personality who values freedom to explore life, skills and talents the most. I'm scared to ask a very broad thread as they might not understand and be quick to judge.\n\nAlso, a bit of background why I'm asking: I've been thinking about this for many nights now. I'm 26, and I feel like I might go down this route. There are oh so many things I want to try and do that I feel like I won't be able to devote my life to a single career. I wanna try being a voice actor, theater or TV actor, or a TV host; I also want to try life behind the camera, like be a scriptwriter or even whatever assistant; then I also want be in the helping profession, teach kids with or without special needs, etc etc! But as you know, everyone says that you have to be a "master of one" if you want to be successful in life...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for sharing your experiences! It's comforting to know I'm not weird for having this mindset. I'm so amazed by how all of you have already done so much. I don't make a lot of jumps because I get too affected by other people's opinions sometimes. Add to that, I'm co-breadwinner of the family so I have to sustain my income. I do feel left out sometimes because some friends are now up the corporate ladder even though I know in my heart, I don't want that for myself (I left my first job just as when I was in line for a promotion because that will keep me in my cubicle longer). Anyway, we make our own happiness and successes, right? Thanks again guys!!
7	I’ve done so many things professionally. Damn I’m such an ISFP 😅Musician, mixing, DJing, caterering, private cheffing, culinary arts teaching, dog training, martial arts teaching, various sales stuff. People are constantly getting upset at me for not sticking to one thing. I’m 26 fyi. 
6	I've worked in the outdoor industry, coffee industry, pastoral position, a writer, and even worked in Alaska for a Barge and Tug company. I've done woodworking, metalworking, worked in a forge, taught people to make knives, throw knives, and shoot guns. \nI was a substitute teacher for 6 months in classrooms from preschool to 6th grade.\nI've even worked for the forest service. \nI'm 25. 
3	Huh, never thought about it but I guess so. Chinese translating, web development, dog walker, eSports coach, and hoping to start at a non-profit for education soon.
3	i'm a little late to the game here... but yeah i think there's nothing wrong with spreading your interests out! go where your interests take you!\n\ni'm questioning my path in university right now, and have been on and off there for a while. i too am juggling the "master of one" vs "jack of all trades" mental battle! that said i'm getting more interested in taking small certification programs for becoming a travel agent, a floral designer, and/or working in the legal cannabis industry here in canada. \n\ni have worked only a few jobs. i have been a fruit picker, clerk at a swimming pool, housekeeper at a hostel, and deli clerk. i have sold some things i've created/found over etsy, and i worked as an extra in a hallmark movie once, lol!\n\ni think variety is the spice of life. we're only here for a bit - it is in our best interest to make it work for us and explore what we feel drawn to! i hope my career path can reflect that once my time on earth is up. i also think that there's so many ways to approach work, you can be doing 9-5, or doing your own thing, or having a couple things going all at once. lifestyle is a great consideration of mine and i hope i can learn to create the lifestyle that works for me!\n\ngood luck out there!
2	Welllll... Librarian, Soldier, Administrative Staff, Helicopter Maintenance Librarian, Care Provider for the Homeless, Line Cook, Insurance Agent, Financial Consultant, Child Protection Coordinator\n\nI don’t feel as accomplished as my peers have been (many of whom have established decorated careers (I’m 28) and often have found their “calling in life”). I also don’t have as much income as they do (cause changing jobs drastically pushes “reset” and you get paid from the bottom rung all over again).\n\nBut I don’t regret it as much as I thought I would (I do, sometimes, mostly to do with lack of sustainable income). I find that I can handle my own problems better, finances, organisation, cooking, taking care of children (none of my own, but if a future in-law ever asks, I can tell them I’m government approved good-with-kids heh). \n\nAt the end of the day, I have a better understanding to do for myself what my peers pay others to do for them. (I wouldn’t say for free though, the effort that goes into it surely wastes my time in ways that I could have paid someone else and saved time (think: cooking, finances), but at least this way there’s no real feeling of out of pocket pinch)
2	Finally a thread I relate to. I’m am isfp and I have my own web business, trade stock, and have an additional FT job. Time to say a very ISFP thing and say you can do anything you set your mind to. 
1	If you're a true ISFP then you probably already are one.
14	Do you, an ISFP, enjoy debating?	I’m somewhat new to Reddit and it is a sombering reminder of how much I dislike debating. I have posted a handful of comments and a few people have seen them as bait to take, which was never the intent behind posting them. It is teh internetz so people are going to disagree with me, especially since I possess some wildly unpopular opinions. \n\nAnyway, I am okay with not agreeing with someone. I don’t have to have the last word. In fact, I welcome diversity of thought. Live and let live, right? But I can’t help but be bothered when people get personal and assumptive in how they respond to my remarks. The assumptive part especially frustrates me. I know. I’m a delicate flower. \n\nIn-person debating is also spectacularly unfun for me, unless it’s over something comically innocuous.\n\nDiscussion is fine, but let’s come away respecting and understanding one another. Even better, let’s end our interaction with some shred of unity of thought!\n\nHow do other ISFPs feel about debating?
12	Wow yeah I’m definitely like that. I almost never participate in any kind of online discussion because of it 
11	I avoid it like a plague. 
10	Yes. I get easily frustrated in any type of conflict. 
4	Once I got angry in a mbti post and damn this INTP had to take every word by word and analyze it "so you can perfect your argument". I just stated how I feel, but I guess internet doesn't care as you said. 
3	Same. Debates make me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI'm not good at expressing myself verbally. And I'm also a delicate flower. I prefer having 'good vs bad' discussions or 'what works for you vs me' rather than 'right vs wrong'. Sadly, some people just really can't help but transform everything into a competition or an argument, and they're all over the internet, lol!\n\n&#x200B;
3	Depending on who its with. My bf is intj and he knows how to have friendly debates so im ok with debating with him (although sometimes he steamrolls me because hes more logical and long winded and i flounder about and get irritated).\n\nBut most of the time i dont simply because i im not great at organizing detailed thoughts outloud. If there was a debate where could write out my answers alone for 20 minutes each tine i would debate more lol so yeah usually if i have differing opinions that i think will turn into debating i keep it to myself because i know ill fuck it up.\n\nOnline tho yeah i tend to jump in and debate stuff sometimes. Idk in writing its a lot easier. 
3	No debater worth his salt will attack  you personally. Did they attack you or your ideas. If they attack you, there as. If they attack your ideas,  and you get insulated, then you should be the one to change 
2	This might help\nhttps://youtu.be/ntcBulfl_IY
2	Circling back around to this post... thought you guys might be able to relate to this one.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/lGMK8VM](https://imgur.com/a/lGMK8VM)
2	I feel like I don't really relate to this nonconfrontational trait of many ISFPs. I actually really like debating people, and I have to get the last word. However, I only have debates with my friends, or with people online whose views or opinions seriously differ from mine. And even then, I try to keep everything respectful and end it on a good note (while proving that I'm right).
2	If it's something I care a lot about, I get really ENTP-y
2	It’s too exhausting to try. I mean, I can but I’ll be pretty dismissive when something I don’t like is said. 
2	I love debates. Though I seem to think of debates in a different way from most people, as in 90% of cases I’ll debate to challenge my view, not to assert it. I’d say I’m pretty good at it usually, at least online where I have time to read over and make sure I don’t lose track of what I’m saying mid-sentence. Obviously that all works best if the other person is chill and open-minded too.\n\nOn the other hand, it can occasionally be fun to debate with a madlad. There’s something satisfying about remaining calm and conducted while someone else is losing their shit over something minor. But usually it’s just tedious.
2	Yes I love them. People genuinely wanting to learn\n\nI hate when people don't take it seriously though, or it's a emotional debacle because then nothing is gained. \n\n
54	I never miss people	Everytime someone says "i missed you" i have to lie and say i missed them too so i dont hurt their feelings. I cant ever remember missing some one. I was sad when my grandma died, but i cant say that i *miss* her. Shes just not around anymore. I never feel like hitting ppl up and seeing how their doing and reconnecting. I dont feel their absence and think longingly of them. I like hanging out with people at times and im happy when im with them but im not sad when im not with them. Even with my boyfriend i dont really miss him when hes not around. I barely feel any loneliness for that matter. I suppose if i were in solitary confinement for months or something it would be a different story but for the most part my own company is enough for me. Is this normal? Am i heartless or what? Im concerned that im missing something important that other people have. Like maybe i dont love right or something. Maybe im too self centered.\n\n\n
21	I'm like that too. I guess we accept things quickly.
12	I'm the complete opposite. Well with certain people. Best friend moved away and it's been incredibly hard without them around. Their presence is missed.
10	So relatable lol. And I also have a hard time typing "I love you too" in a text. 
6	I'm the same. Sure you're not an ISTP? :)
5	I dwell on potential absence. It's hard for me to cope with knowing loved ones will die one day. Is that a kind of missing?  \n  \nAs long as they're happy and well (and hopefully flourishing), I'm fine, and I don't need to be around them. But this *Mono no aware* thing will sneak up on me—often when I'm with the person. I suppose a psychologist would chalk it up to *anxiety*, maybe with elements of ADD.  \n  \nNot missing people sounds anomalous to me. I think I could manage an abnormally long amount of time in isolation, but I can still imagine the warmth certain people provide. It's like, I've taught myself not to need the comfort of friendship, but when it does happen, I think, "*ah, i've been missing out on this*." (which becomes, "*I miss this*". "*I miss you*".)  \n\n  \nI hope that makes some sense. It's late, I'm going to bed.  \n  \n>—then on the shore   \nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think   \nTill love and fame to nothingness do sink.
3	It's interesting to see how many of us are similar in this way. Can someone explain how this makes sense as an isfp? Thanks!
2	Same here. You're not alone ;)
2	Almost entirely, except with spouse or kids. (When away for more than 2 days)
2	I can relate in a sense. My sister left for college and I cried the day she left. But now after a few months I rarely think about her and the only time we talk is when she texts or asks to call me. I never initiate anything. It confuses me because I love my sister, but at the same time I don't miss her. I'm very sensitive and emotional overall, maybe I just processed losing her too quickly? Idk.
2	My love for people is only apparent once they're gone or I don't see them for a while.  I take people in my life for granted.  I guess I get used to them if I see them every single day.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder. I love my cat, but if I'm away from her for a few days I start to really miss her and my love for her becomes very apparent.
2	I actually totally feel this way with friends. But I definitely miss my parents though. I honestly feel it has to do with the fact that I just don’t feel that personally close with even “close” friends which in itself is kind of sad tbh
1	I’m like that, but only bc I had only a few people I genuinely cared about, and they screwed me over. Since then, whenever someone walks out of my life, it doesn’t really make much of a difference to me
1	I am the same
1	My best friend passed away 3 years ago and when she died I was heartbroken and then the day of the funeral I was ok because I cried 2 days beforehand and I went home after the funeral and I was ok 😐 still sad but ok . I think of her every now and then but not all the time and I don’t think of her until around the time she passed which was early October. Only time when I start thinking about her everyday and I start missing her is around early October it’s so weird it’s like my subconscious mind knows this is when she passed 😕 I’m missing her right now 😔 but if the person is alive no I don’t miss them unless it’s my older sister & mother and I haven’t spoke/seen them in awhile 🙂
3	I feel personally attacked, this hurts 😢	Was googling something when i stumbled on this. \n[Ouch](https://i.imgur.com/AN7CuQY.jpg)\n\nThere is a link to the article of you want to check it out.\n[https://mbtimasters.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/the-harsh-truth-about-personality-types/](https://mbtimasters.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/the-harsh-truth-about-personality-types/)\n\nMaybe it's just bad article after all. What do you think?
20	This article says more about the person posting it than it does about any personality type. They sound like they have anger issues. It’s a shame they can’t see the beauty in the diversity of personality types.\n\nAdditionally, not everyone will like us. It is freeing to realize not everyone in life is going to like me. I may never know why, but even if it is my personality they don’t like I can accept that and go on without them.
11	It's a bad article.\n\nI'm not an ISFP but I really like you guys. You are endlessly fascinating people, with so much to offer and so many things to teach the rest of us. You guys can be unexpectedly hilarious, easy to be around and refreshing to chat with. I like that you guys notice the things that other people don't, and you always have a neat and fresh perspective to bring to the table. So don't feel attacked - a lot of us feel really lucky to have people like you in our lives!

5	I stopped reading at 'faggots instead'.  \n  \nLife is too short. Be careful with your time.
5	Haha its ok im sure they are trolling. Dont let it get to you :)
4	ENTPs often like to screw with people so it's not surprising it was obviously written by an ENTP. What is surprising is how utterly boring and badly written it is. Most of it is more cringe-worthy than funny, and comes off like somebody trying to cram as many shocking/rude words into every paragraph they can as a replacement for actual humor.\n\nI have to admit 'but what is... trash?' for INTPs made me laugh. My wife is an INTP and she found it funny as well. A lot of the other types are basically just 'worthless retard faggots who should commit suicide', and yeah, that's pretty viscerally upsetting and hurtful - but also it's just really not entertaining at all. There's nothing insightful or interesting or amusing there.\n\nTL;DR: I think this is supposed to be funny, but it falls completely flat.
2	lmao 
2	Dumbass doesn't even proofread for typos
2	That whole article is pure gold btw, loved it
1	Lmao, sounds like if an ENTP wrote it
1	"I hate how they take things so personally!"\n\n(Person reading a random WordPress blog takes it personally)\n\nCan't say I'm with ya on this one lol\n\nNot trying to be mean, but the only reason you would feel any pain is if this applied to you (or at least you think it does). If you don't like something about yourself change it. \n\n\n\n
8	Have any of you ISFPs confused yourselves as extraverted? If so, how did you finally come to the conclusion that you’re ISFP?	
13	I have absolutely. I am just slightly more introverted than extroverted. What sold me on it was that after I left work from being extroverted all day, I wanted to go home and be by myself. Like, I got so excited about being by myself I would basically jump up and down with joy. \n\nI love interaction, but I prefer a very small group when doing it. \n\nI also do not sit in the middle when I’m going to lunch with a large group. If you sit close to the wall, you’re probably introverted. 
5	Nope. From the day of my birth I have been an introvert. 
3	I have moments where I feel extraverted because I like people, make friends easily, and will frequently initiate conversations. But at the end of the day, I get really tired after talking a lot.\n\nFor example, I hadn't been to my old church in two years and two weeks ago I visited. When I was in the parking lot, I saw someone I knew immediately who greeted me before I could get in the building. I saw three more people right after that, who I allotted roughly five minutes of conversation apiece. After that, I continued to run into someone I knew every few steps who I also gave 3-5 minutes of conversation. At a certain point, I just put my head down and power walked toward the building because the relentless emotions of reuniting with casual acquaintances followed by small talk became overwhelming. The service was fine and gave me time to unwind, followed by more conversations. I was mentally exhausted that night.\n\nI'm going back to that city this next week for a wedding and a small part of me is considering not attending that church again, which I dearly love, solely because it feels like I have my 'social fill' of my friends from there and I'm worried about another parking lot situation. I probably will go still, but I am having those introverted feelings, haha!
6	Here’s my experience:\n\nI will reliably be  “extroverted”, which is assertive and enthusiastic, when I’m intoxicated. \n\nI will sometimes be extroverted when I’m with close friends, and I’m the “funny one” of the group, or the one who leads the group towards goals or i can sense that the vibe is not positive enough. \n\nI will rarely be extroverted when I’m the “less funny one”, when the vibe is naively positive and/or overly structured or suppressive. \n\nTo call yourself an introvert would mean that in the infinite amount of situations you have encountered, (supposedly captured by the binary questions asked on the MBTI test), you will more likely than not (<50% of the time) exhibit introverted behavior across your entire life span. \n\nI think this entire subreddit, as well as the MBTI community in general, can benefit from the mindset that we naturally and must continue to stretch our default temperaments. Trying to explain yourself an “extrovert” is only useful as a momentary gauge of your behavior as an adaptation to succeed in your social environment. Understand that both extroverted and introverted behaviors are morally neutral and inevitable consequences each of us having an internal and external life. Both introverts and extroverts are paired with equally successful life outcomes as well as self reported well being, so it’s wrong to assume either is better. \n\nIn general, good luck extracting anything useful from MBTI. I remember swearing by it, and realizing it was not serving me, so I began reading into Big 5 personality dynamics where I found a more cohesive understanding of human personality. 
4	Experience with ENTJ?	Hey fellow ISFPs. What’s been your experience with ENTJs? Friends, relationships, dates, coworkers, anyone. I went on a couple of dates with an ENTJ Enneagram 8, and lord I never wanna meet another one ever again. 😅
6	Love them. They balance me out. One of my best friends in high school was an ENTJ and she was awesome. I dated one on and off for years and have a couple of ENTJ in-laws.\n\nThe intense ones can be tough if you’re particularly sensitive, but I’m amazed by their energy and assertiveness. The female ones are often better because they’re more empathetic and emotionally aware.
5	My experience is that they hare extremely fun to be around... in small doses.
4	I've been in a relationship with one for almost a year, and let me tell you it hasn't been too healthy for me. I'm very easy going and he hates doing what other people want to do, so I end up compromising on everything. I hate influencing other peoples actions, so I wait until I'm right at my breaking point before asserting what I want/need, and even then he'll always respond with "nah dont feel like it sorry." I love to go out and go on adventures, and he loves to stay home, so we've only been out a handful of times. On the rare occasion that we'll go do something I want to do, he'll spend the next few weeks reminding me of how generous he was for doing that for me, and how much energy/time/money it took from him which makes me feel like a burden. He saps my energy gives so little back. Needless to say I'm not recommending this situation. \n\nI know I should get out, but right now, a boring relationship is better than nothing. I've just accepted that I'll never get more from him than a night in watching TV, and I can deal with that. (Also I'm a pussy who hates confrontation lol sos)\n\nEDIT: wording
4	never date an NT if you're an SF.. it's that simple. \n\nmy anecdotal experience talking. might go fine for a short season but not longterm.. 
3	I've literally only seen them in fiction, tbh. True, I might have seen them irl but I can't recall.
3	Went on a date with one and it was fine. The shitty part was after (bailing on me twice and being wishy washy) dropped like a hot potato..Im supposed to be the wishy washy one come'on.
2	I’ve never hung around one enough to know how I feel about them. I’ve always been extremely curious about the duality of our types. What was so bad about this date? 
2	Never met any of them (or probably I just avoid them after I got a bad vibe around them XD).\n\nBut I know a classmate who is an INTJ. Surprise surprise, I tend to avoid talking to him. He's too judgemental and questions every smallest things that crossed his logic or value.
2	C S Joseph YOUTUBE channel reckons Donald Trump is ENTJ 
1	I am married to one :). We are an ideal balance.
1	well the ENTJ is the complete opposite of the ISFP so i guessss we really dont get along with them i mean u can try but its hard.

13	To the here and now.	I am reading a book called The Power of Now. I’m still early in but I think it’s a book I needed. \n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to be an ISFP. I was okay with my feelings. I liked my artistic self. \n\nWhat I couldn’t stand was the constant chain of thoughts in my head. I had to put on music to drown out the thoughts to sleep.\n\nWhat I feared was the constant barrage of painful memories that kept dragging me back to the past.\n\nLost in the thoughts and memories, I let the present moment pass me by like a stream of water.\n\nI envied ISFPs because you looked calm and level-headed all the while keeping your values and feelings.\n\nI may not become an ISFP, but I can surely become a mindful INFP. \n\nI am on my journey to the here and now.\n\nIt’s just some random thoughts I wanted to share before I go to sleep.
3	I read the first few chapters of this book and cant read it fast. It's way too much information. 
2	Sometimes i start daydreaming while walking through the woods or whatever  \n  \ni've gotten better at stopping myself and appreciating what/who's around me
2	You gotta be careful with your thoughts as if you’re unhappy, it can get toxic very quickly. That’s the time when I need to drown them out with activity of music. It can be hard and hard on the people around you if you get angry. 
1	I've found that when it comes to painful memories, mindfulness is just a part of the equation. The other part is relentless compassion for the wounded child you were (and that still exists within you).\n\nOne thing I noticed when doing mindfulness was that it was very difficult to be mindful of the body, so I would mostly just be mindful of sights, sounds etc. But being mindful of the body (muscle tensions, breathing etc.) is really the most important thing for staying grounded.
13	Thoughts on The Office?	I know many people who either love it or hate it. Some of the sarcasm is very, very subtle which is why I find alot of people dont find it funny. \n\nI love it, not so much for some of the on screen jokes - but more so for the camera and realism of the effects and reactions - staying in tune with social cues of happiness, regret, sarcasm, akwardness, etc. \n\nAnyone else?
9	Top five favorite shows ever.
4	I love it. Love the sarcasm and love seeing the different relationships develop. 
5	Fuck yeah I love that shit
3	Eh, I don’t get the craze, but that’s just me. I find Parks and Rec hilarious though.
3	I enjoyed more in my youth. Not as much anymore. Was definitely one of my favorite shows though.
3	It's hilarious but I'm not gonna watch it more than once like most people do it seems
3	AMAZING 
3	I really liked it a lot actually but definitely preferred Parks and Rec, which just seemed much less... 'mean', for want of a better word. \n\nA lot of 'The Office's jokes with Michael Scott made me uncomfortable because it was just this jerk, using his power to be a jerk. I like the series much better when it moved away from his character.\n\nAlso, Pam is definitely an ISFP, fite me.
5	I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although they could have cut down on Jim & Pams relationship.
2	I don't get it honestly
2	its awesome
2	Loved it
2	Love it!
2	Was alright. I had it on the background while playing video games due to all the scenes involving michael scott that made me think “alright thats enough shows for today”. My favorite parts were mostly side character plots, things involving dwight, and the last few season after michael scott left. 
5	How to befriend an ISFP?	I would really like to know how you guys chose friends or what makes you like someone, especially when meeting by them for the first time! \n\nI’d really like some insight!
7	Someone who’s friendly and chatty is always good!
5	>.> <.< >.> who's asking???
6	Be genuine and authentic. Its a big factor for me. For me, I don’t like pretend stuff or small talks. Skip the small talks and ask them questions about themselves. Find out about their hobbies and interests. To instantly connect with me,  just talk about anime lol. And I wouldn’t stop chatting. \n\nJust show genuine interest in them, like they are the most fascinating creatures in the world and they will love it. I think. Can’t say this for every ISFPs. 
4	Having the same interests helps *immensely*, and being friendly helps a lot, too. Don't try to force anything, though, just be yourself and see what happens.
3	If you can connect by talking about your feelings then that's the sure fire way to become a best friend than just a friend.
3	Be genuine and authentic. If you are empathetic, humble and considerate , I'll think highly of you. Basically people with high integrity and can give space. Also, you are going to have to be proactive, because we(I) dont initiate communication.
2	Probably helps if you do most of the talking at first 😂 but you can’t force a friendship. Talk too much and they’ll feel like they can’t get a word in. Don’t talk enough and the friendship will never bloom 
2	If you want to be friends with me just talk to me from time to time, really. If you want to be my best friend you'll have to be genuine, caring and noble.
1	Be the one to initiate the conversation. 
1	What I like in a friend is when they don't jump to completely shut down something I say, even if they disagree. It's okay to disagree with me, but try to understand why I feel the way I do because I will do that for you.\n\nInstead of "Um, you're absolutely wrong!," I'll word it this way: "Really? What made you feel that way?" And I'll continue to ask questions. I show my disagreement in asking the questions versus blatantly calling them out. Sometimes the questioning changes my mind or gives me even more respect for their opinion. I like to find understanding and common ground with friends, even with things we disagree on. Let's talk about the things we disagree on, because it would be boring never to do so, but let's also move to the topics that are more fun. Maybe it sounds fake to others, but it feels invalidating to one's experiences and intellect when someone bluntly shuts you down. I see my ISFP approach to disagreement as focusing on common ground and striving for unity. All this advice is for someone who I want to be friends with, mind you, and I do like making friends. But if someone does not have the goal of connection, and it becomes obvious to me, I have no issue 'telling them like it is.' But I'll exit the conversation pretty quickly because I can't stand confrontation.\n\nIt's why I never enjoyed when a man was interested in me and teased me relentlessly about my likes, dislikes, and opinions. Or frequently tells me 'you're wrong.' (Insert jokes about women always needing to be right). The teasing approach does not work with ISFPs! Not that you asked for a romantic pointer, haha, but there's a bonus tip.
1	Talk to them
5	What anime do you think was made for ISFPs?	Or just anything you think an ISFP would love.
10	Fate/Zero and Attack on Titan. Fantasy and lots of action. Gorgeous art styles, character designs and soundtracks. And the story for both of these series are too good.
7	I think everyone has different taste in anime. \n\nI can’t say this for every ISFPs but I am a sucker for anime with beautiful artstyle. “Garden of words” for example. The details they put into everything is like eye-porn to me. \n\nAmazing soundtracks is another factor. This could range from action to sad. \n\nOf course the story has to be great too. Does it get me excited and hyped? Does it have a lot of cool fighting scenes and smooth animation? (AoT, BnHA, Haikyuu!!, Kill la kill) \n\nIs it emotional and moving? \n\nFunny as hell?\n\nAre the characters well developed? \n\nSo many questions... \n\n
3	I really enjoy dothack//sign and rurouni kenshin. Action and interesting story lines with compelling characters. 
6	Hunter x Hunter, Arslan Senki, and Gintama are a few that I personally love. 
3	I don't watch a lot of anime because I prefer subs but I don't have the attention span to attentively watch it without doing something else.\nThat said, Cowboy Bebop rules
3	Nichijou. 
2	KyoAni shows, especially the earlier stuff (imo their adaptations are much stronger works than their originals). They really capture the feeling of particular moments through lighting, gestures, and sound. Small things that might not mean anything by themselves, but still they're the something about a moment you just can't forget. Personal faves are the Haruhi series+movie, KEY adaptations, Hyouka.\n\nThey can lay it on a lil thick at times, to the point of coming off insincere and off-putting (cough, Kyoukai no Kanata...). But when moments in earnest shine through, it's pretty magical. They also do great physical comedy (Nichijou).
2	For me, it's Dragon Ball.  \n\n\nAlso I really like G Gundam.
2	The Ancient Magus' Bride
3	Nothing cutesy or comedic. I'd say.. battle-royale style anime with morally gray characters instead of clear-cut protagonists/antagonists, unpredictable deaths. Examples: [Juni Taisen](https://youtu.be/zRuByytp8sA) , Gantz , X/1999 , Attack on Titan
3	I don’t watch anime. 
1	I like a lot of shoujo types. I really like Kimi ni Todoke (romance, high school). Maybe the main character is isfp and the main love interest perfect because he is probably Esfj. \n\nCard captor sakura is pretty great too. Main character from esfj with main male lead probably isfp. \n\n
1	I love the “pretty” anime’s - you know, the ones that are drawn beautifully. I also love intricate storyline anime’s and ones that pull emotions from you. Weirdly enough I’m also a sucker for shounen - I’m a gal jsyk. Some of my faves are:\n\nFMA: Brotherhood, Barakamon, Boku no Hero, Akatsuki no Yona, Gangsta, Haikyuu, Arslen Senki, Kingdom, Death Note, Rorouni Kenshin (Ahhh Samurai X), Mushishi, Nodame Cantible, Hunter x Hunter, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, AOT, Yowamushi Pedal... etc etc.\n\nTaking a look at my list though - it’s pretty eclectic. I just like a little bit of everything.

6	"using Sensing in an Extroverted direction"	
5	>Accordingly, they have a great deal of tolerance and acceptance dealing with people who might encounter negative judgment from society in general.\n\nWhoa, this is really true for me.\n\n> They can see something positive in everyone.\n\nNot this, though.
2	Not sure if anyone has ever posted this link here before but I found it somewhat comforting in a time of severe turmoil within myself.\n\nAnyone on here ever tried to focus on developing their "Sensing" in a extroverted and healthy/mindful way?
4	How do ISFPs feel when someone asks them if they want to share something that's bothering them?	Will they share how they feel? Or prefer to keep it to themselves? If they keep to themselves, is there any reason for that?
27	Can’t speak for all, but when I have a lot on my mind and someone asks me “what’s wrong,” it’s like my brain shuts down. I really want to share, but (maybe out of defense?) my brain and mouth won’t communicate. If I’m given a chance to bring it up once I’ve organized my thoughts, I’m able to share more easily. \nAlso sometimes I’m only bothered for two minutes and then I’m over it. So, it’s not always necessary to share what’s on my mind. 
3	It depends on who’s asking. I have a couple of close friends I speak to. If it’s coming from a place of genuine concern, then yes, I would share if something is bothering me. If I can sense that someone is just being nosy, then I wouldn’t share. It’s a very small trust circle, and I would only share with them. I don’t trust people easily and if I am willing to share with them, then that means I trust them enough. Even then, it’s hard to share. Sometimes it’s not personal. I just don’t wanna talk about it. 
2	You just talk, and wait for them to open up (if they feel like it). \n Sometimes silence works, too.  \n  \nIt's showing that you're there for them, whether or not you know what the problem is.  \n  \n(this isn't really type specific)
2	Unless it is my therapist or best friend, I ain't talking. 
2	I don't even share things that are bothering me with my boyfriend for a long time. It frustrates him but I just completely close up.
1	I pretty much dont open up about it. Thats why i journal. I dont need to tell ppl stuff.
1	If there is something wrong, what's the other person gonna do about it? I'm a grown ass adult. I keep my mouth shut if somebody asks me something like that. I'll be the first one to say something if anything I say is gonna change anything.
1	Just be like, “Do you wanna talk if something is bothering you? You don’t have to if you don’t want to, but I’m here to talk if you need to.” And if your friend decides to open up, then be as genuine in your response as possible. People are either looking for empathy or solutions or a combination of both. I suppose the challenge is to know what your friend is looking for. Usually, if you’re close friends or have been friends for a long time, then you’ll know. 
1	I will keep it to myself unless I am asked. This actually happened recently with my SO. He only noticed because I was quietly crying. And I told shakily told him what I was feeling.

1	His fuckin' beard is weird 
6	I'm struggling to fit in	Hi! I'm a 20 y/o ISFP, and I really need some advice with socializing.\n\nFor context, I had a rough childhood (bullying and such) and that made me distrustful of other people. \n\nYears later I went to a therapyst and I recovered from that. I changed high school and met new people, practising what my therapyst told me. It went nice and I even met my actual bf, but besides that, nothing was authentic to me.\n\nThen my first year of college. It was superamazing. I've met people like me, genuine, lovely, caring and with same interests as me. But I chose wrong my major and had to change unis.\n\nNow it's starting my 2nd year in this new uni. I haven't fit in yet... I feel like I'm revisiting my old me. I feel so bad that I left my true friends, and now I can't connect with anybody, they seem so alien to me.\n\nSo I'm trying to get some advice from ISFPs like me, maybe you've got experiences to share and lessons you've learned.\n\nIn any case, thank you for your attention :)\n\n
3	We’ll never fully fit in anywhere :) just be weird ol’ you, and let that freak flag fly man. People surprisingly enjoy the eccentricity.
3	I have been where you are, so that’s why I understand so well. I think the more we learn to let go of how we “should” act to fit in and gradually learn to be ourselves, it makes us more original. Everyone is weird; some try to cover it up more than others. The more we let go of who we want to be and act more like the people we REALLY are, we will acquire more “real” friends. There may not be many, but the people that do happen to come into your life at the most coincidental times- the ones that you just ‘click’ with in originality or “weirdness”— those are the people to stick with. \n\nThey come and go, but us ISFPs are adventurers. People come into our lives to teach us lessons or to help us in our intuitive direction, but altogether, we learn to take that in either a positive or a negative way when they do end up leaving (which they probably will; everything is temporary, and that’s perfectly fine).
1	[deleted]
1	How did you meet your friends in your first year of uni? Find similar environments.
2	Have you ever accidentally hurt somebody before? If so, how do you feel about?	I feel like I've accidentally hurt somebody, and they're just not saying. I feel a bit bad about that, and I really hope I can make amends tomorrow.
6	Breathe,\nacknowledge what was said or done that might have hurt them\nbreathe again.\nThink of possible words to use to observe their point of view.\nempathize and then possibly apologize for the outcome of your behavior or words. Be aware of your gut and think of the next likely outcome to happen as the result of your behavior, words said cannot be undone.\nIf they aren’t saying anything to let you know that you hurt their feelings then it is an unfortunate situation. It could eventually unfold in a slight situation, breaks the camels back, and that unstable fuel from before is being used to harm you. Probably would’ve been less severe if they had addressed it when it hurt them. You can’t really do anything at that stage, until they grant you a glance into their introspection. Observe them closely and if they’re acting any different, distance yourself. They may be disinterested continuing with you until they sort themselves, if they’re acting similarly then continue along, but keep your eyes open, let them be comfortable to tell what hurt them, if they need to.\n\nAre you sure you actually hurt they’re feelings? Do they have a reason to be upset in the first place? If so, then just try to be neutral about it while respecting their feelings. 
2	Am I ISFP?	17 year-old male\n\nI get tired of people very very fast.\n\nI hate talking for the sake of talking.\n\nI'm very private about my interests.\n\nI hate fake people.\n\nI love music. I probably listen to 5 hours of it a day. I listen to music more for the melody but I find the lyrical aspect more interesting. I mostly listen to stuff that I feel I can relate to. I'm constantly listening to albums I haven't heard yet and there's stuff I love in every genre. My favorite band's Pink Floyd.\n\nI love video games but I play them more to appreciate them than to enjoy them if that makes sense. Graphics aren't really something I care about, almost all the games I play are from past generations.\n\nMy heart definitely controls my head. I got severely, severely depressed for almost a year over girl I never even kissed because she liked me for a tiny bit and I didn't feel disconnected from everyone else for the first time. Love's probably what I think about the most.\n\nMaking friends is incredibly hard for me. I'm still scared of people because I was severely bullied as a kid. Only friends I still have are from elementary school when making friends was incredibly easy.\n\nI'm not interested in shallow friendships. I have four friends but I have a very deep connection with all of them. I had a traumatic childhood and so did all of my friends and I feel like they're the only people who've accepted me.\n\nI'll sometimes become extremely reclusive. I'll stay in my bedroom with the light off and not talk to anyone for a week. I often forget to talk to my friends for weeks but they're always happy to hear from me.\n\nI've never left the west coast in my life but I have a strong desire to see the world.\n\nI'm intelligent but depression and laziness has caused me to have absolutely horrible grades. In 4th and 5th grade I received 100% on the really fucking long state tests in math. I was the only person to do it both times. I get straight F's though (sorry if I sound like a dickhead here, I'm not trying to brag by anonymously telling strangers I'm smart, I just think it could be relevant).\n\nI both dislike and love almost everyone. There's people who I'll think are really cool, but I'd want to hang out with almost none of them (if that makes sense).\n\nPeople think I'm pretty funny, but I have an unusual sense of humor. All my jokes are really just thoughts I have, I don't really know how to explain it. I'd never try to put someone down with a joke.\n\nI don't do anything that I don't want to do.\n\nAll of my morals are based on my own values.\n\nWhat type do I sound like?
1	Do you regret the past or worry about the future?\n\n“Gosh. I can’t believe that happened. It still makes me cringe.”\n\n“I am scared because something absurd can happen in the future.”\n\nWhich one?
1	Do a Myers Briggs test and find out? 
8	How to be a healthy ISFP?	What can an anxious, worried, stressed, mostly lost in the head ISFP do to be more grounded and stay in the present more?\n\nI assume meditation is a starter. \n\nAlso what does an unhealthy ISFP look like? 
9	I feel at my best when I’m having my alone time somewhere nice outside like my backyard. I lay out a blanket, sit there and pretty much do anything that feels right. It varies between singing/playing guitar, playing cards, drawing, or even listening to music and watching the clouds or trees.\n\nBut yes, meditation is highly underrated and has been a big life changer for me.
5	I find that a drive through the mountains or a hike can clear any stress or anxiety for me. A lot of that also comes from prayer and meditation as well. 
5	What are you stressed and anxious about, OP?  You might just need to learn a little balance.  I NEED time by myself to read, write or play music.  Sometimes I just need to go for a walk alone through the city with headphones on.  Also running or exercise really seems to help me.\n\nHow’s the balance in your life? Do you feel like you’re taking care of yourself?
5	When I'm at my most unhealthy I am so overcome with anxiety I pick up little habits like picking at my nails and aggressively chewing my lip. Everything startles me and I am constantly on the defense. I'll spend all of my time staring at screens and pull away from loved ones, clinging to my most affectionate cat as "the only one that could ever love me". It's very dramatic.\n\nIt is essential for me to get light exercise, spend some time breathing fresh air while taking in my surroundings, and to use my hands in a productive way. Having a good conversation with anybody to build a sense of belonging somewhere helps a ton. Having a mentally stimulating book/tv/game to feel excited about is great too.\n\nOh and cleaning. Appeal to your inferior Te and organize your living space. Few things send me reeling into a bad mental state than a messy kitchen. 
3	Getting up and doing things has helped me a lot although its really hard to get the ball rolling. When i stagnate and isolate i get really really down. I would say try to engage the Te. 
1	As far as i know, from experience, binging and isolating, avoiding social interactions, being impulsive(in a bad way), blocking when stressed etc. are traits of an unhealthy isfp. To overcome them i relied on exercise, some meditation and leaving my comfort zone, the last one is hard to do, but just go slow and steady and it'll work. You won't care about certain things that made you anxious or uncomfortable(talking to a stranger, exercising in public etc.), just take it easy amd don't force "progress".
4	Best place to take the test?	I feel like every test I take I am either getting isfp or intp. Is there a reliable test I can take where I can know for sure what I am? I most closely identify with isfp 
3	You should try the similar minds mbti functions test. It tests your dominant functions. If you score high on fi youre probably isfp. I would say that if youre getting isfp 50% of the time youre likely isfp.
2	No test is reliable, you're better off just learning functions
2	16 personalities 
1	Read up on functions. There’s a website I don’t know if I’m allowed to name it but I could message you if you wanna know. 
1	Fuck so I’m either an enfj, an infj, an infp, or an isfp kms
27	Really picky with friends as you got older?	I went from high school’s “I want to be popular and have a lot of friends” to “we have this in common, let’s be friends(even though you have just scratched surface level to friendship)”. Now, I have shifted to “okay. Maybe we have a slight possibility of being friends, but here are the prerequisites”.\n\nI’m picky with who I let in now, which leads me to living a pretty solitary life. A happy solitary life, at that.\n\nAny other ISFPs?\n
19	Have you ever met an older ISFP who isn’t a loner?\n\nI haven’t.
9	At 24 im already down to two friends. I have many friendly acquaintances tho. This is enough for me. I imagine ill be a full loner by 30.
9	Picky? Yes when I was younger. I wanted good friends but it never came true. I spent half of life friendless. Now idgaf.
7	I think like most ISFP we have lots of friendly acquaintances but very few people that resonate with us on a deep level. Other than a significant other I find that most of my relationships come and go as I get older. I have maybe one or two friends that I can connect with past surface level.\n\nI do have some childhood friends that I haven't seen in years but know that we would reconnect instantly if we run into each other. 
4	Yes, yes, yes!!!! You have read my mind like word for word.
2	Let's be friends mate ENTP here
2	i’m still in the “I want to be friends with 89% of people who like the same things I do” stage. (until they say something that bothers me and I begin avoiding them)\n\nWith dating, on the other hand... I’ve gotten extremely picky.\n\nI went from “I don’t care, I just want a boyfriend for the sake of having one” to “this dude doesn’t appreciate my shit humor at all, and he doesn’t know how to have a real conversation... oof, dear God,  if you’re out there,  please make him stop talking to me because I’d rather die alone.”\n\nI’m definitely more okay with being (mostly) friendless than when I was as a teenager. I recently made a new friend from school and I never thought I’d see the day.
1	I don't even know if it's being picky. People want their friends' to have common interests. Just like how people want their romantic partner to be attractive. It's not shallow. It's normal and perfectly reasonable. 
6	I always get compliments from friends for being "Cool" and "Chill" as well as "mellow"	Is this common for other ISFPS? and if so how often do you receive compliments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI enjoy these compliments. but sometimes i get all messed up because i would question myself if they are actually being serous. \n\n Most of the time they are genuine.\n\nbut i  understand that compliments could also be my weak-spot.  
11	I get called “down-to-earth” and”laid back” often. It’s mostly because I don’t say what’s really going on in my head
4	Ive had ppl think im a stoner even tho i dont smoke at all. Apparently i "seem like one" whatever that means. I hope it means they think im chill? Idk.
2	I can be called "chill" sometimes, but that's about it.
1	I’m often called chill, or likened to a stoner. Also people think I’m gay, though that one is half true.\n\nAlso laid back.
8	Relationship with ISFP making me sick	Hello everyone ^^\n\nAs an ENFP, I got this strong need to share my thoughts and feelings so... here am I!\n\nAnyway, I've been in a loving relationship with this sweet, gentle, caring male ISFP for like 5 months and everything is actually going great and very fast (I've met his friends and family, we've spent 2 wonderful weeks together at the sea, he has met my parents, ...). Btw I'm 20 and he's 2 years older.\n\nEverything is perfect... except in my head. I have this constant feeling of "we're not meant for each other". Like we have needs we can't fulfill. Well, here are all my thoughts:\n\nI feel like I'm all useless... when he's happy, it's okay but when he's down (oftenly), I feel like I can do nothing for him. If I'm useless in his worst moments, what's the point?? Yesterday, he was all sad and he only said stuffs like "can't wait to see my bff tonight" or "I feel so lonely" (even though I was hugging him). I try to understand him, I try to do many things to cheer him up (many acts of service, hugs and kisses, words of affirmation, making him laugh a bit; I even asked him to punch me if it can make him feel better xD)\nBut he'll only feel bad and will say "don't bother yourself for me". He doesn't understand that it is not bothering me... I try to listen to him but he has hard time to open up and share his feelings with words (typical ISFP). \n\nI know that I'm trying too hard and it's not my role to be his "savior" but still... we're supposed to be partners, a duo, and being with our SO should make us feel better...\n\nI feel like he's with me because he's afraid that he couldn't get better, that he likes me a lot (lots of affection) but it's not "love". When he says that he loves me, it feels untrue. I feel like he needs to be understood but I can't understand him because we're so different. That there is not this "connection" (or is it just me as an ENFP?).\n\nIt's killing me. I want to cry all the time and even want to throw up while eating. I don't know what to do. I thought of breaking up many times because I don't see the point of this relationship (a bit idealistic but if we're not meant for each other, why should we stay together?). At the same time, I want to stay for his sake because it's a difficult time in his life (school being very stressing) and... I love him ^^\n\nI know that MBTI doesn't resolve everything and that we are all unique but I'm in despair. I've already talked to him but it hasn't changed anything.\n\nWhat are your thoughts/advice?\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks a lot for your reading. Have a nice day/evening :)
15	Married to ISFP 5 years. I still can’t influence their emotions in any way, though I’ve never felt that I needed to. Their Fi is just too strong. (I personally think that the only people who can cheer them up, are Fe-dominants, ENFJ or ESFJ). Let him feel what he feels. It doesn’t reflect less on you as a person.
5	Imo, this isn’t the most healthy relationship. On that though, the best thing you can do is based on your decisions/actions toward you two. You noticed you keep trying to help and be his savior, but we can’t change other people. Maybe a change in perception with that/seeing from the bigger picture that he will only change if he really wants to. \n\nAlso, if you’re having “he’s not the one” thoughts, listen to your gut instinct, because ignoring it or hoping that feeling will change over time just won’t work. At least that’s how I see it. I’m an ISFP, and I’ve been in very similar relationships.
3	Well thank you for your answers. I guess that I'm too empathetic or immature idk, I always want happiness for everyone and feel bad when I can't do anything about it. It's the first time I don't know how to behave with someone close
3	Uh you gotta have a talk where you let him in on some of this stuff. Thats where you need to start. If he doesnt know whats going on with you and youre building up negative thoughts and feelings it might start coming out as resentment so you need to clear the air and get you two on the same page. After that see what you guys have and decide whether its time to break up or not.
2	If it's making you sick, it might be a good idea to back off a bit. Go out with friends- get a pedicure, go see a movie. Just take your mind off the situation. You giving into your anxiety will only make the situation worse for you and him. It could push him to break-up with you too, if he feels like you can't handle the relationship.\n\nRegardless of type, feeling that anxious only a few months into a relationship is not healthy.\n\nIf you feel like the relationship is wrong, it just might be. Ask yourself, what do you want from a partner- not just what do you want to give. Is he giving you this? If not, it could be time for a talk.
2	In the most significant relationship, it was the other person doing what you’re doing now. It was exhausting for him to think he had to ‘hold the pieces of me together’, so to speak. He ended up taking time out of his life helping me. In the end though, it was like I had built up a wall that no one could get through, and whatever he said just went in one ear and out the other. I couldn’t have been helped by him or anyone else, only me. I saw that it broke him and I didnt realize I needed to change until it was all said and done, but it was something that only I could have gotten through my own head. Idk if its an ISFP thing or a personal thing, but my worst habit is getting so caught up in my own head and my own needs that I forget about the feelings or needs of those around me
2	You should check out r/codependency and learn more about what it can look like. I was like you in my last relationship. I know you're trying to take care of him in the best way that you can but it's really taking a toll on your mental health. Here's a helpful link https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/9dqqd9/signs_you_might_be_in_a_codependent_relationship/?st=JLRLM4XJ&sh=ffc8c0fe
1	dear OP, i felt this way about my first ISFP boyfriend and it turns out that my instinct as an ENFP, that it wasn't love, was something i was right about. he didn't agree at first when i wanted to break up, but after 7 months of being apart, he admitted that he was more afraid of losing the comfort and security of being together than wanting to be together with me. i saw that from a mile away because i had the intuition about it, so you have to stick to your guns even if doesnt see it right away, he'll come around to understand it later on. imho :)
1	He seems like a dude that wants to just be himself \n\nCaring about/for somebody else or even being receptive in that way is a major security hole when it comes to life \n\nLook at divorce statistics and male suicide rates for statistics\n\nI like to this of the song lite bright, it explains it perfectly for me\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/4nHsQ4S2gIrSJMitQ2y05d?si=eDoHCpGsSCSLrOxF7q_jhQ\n\nYou will HAVE to give him space. \n\nHe will never change\n\nThat's not bad\n\nIt's who he is\n\nGood luck :)
2	Do ISFPs like these gifts?	Graduation for highschool is coming up, and I have two ISFP male friends - one is musically-inclined, the other is really sporty. I was thinking of making handmade personalized pop-up cards, with writings about our best memories together etc. but do ISFPs like them? I read that guys prefer practical stuff and hate handmade stuff, so I was thinking of buying chocolate instead. Thoughts? 
10	Even though cards themselves are an okay gift, the fact someone took time into a gift for me makes it special
8	I personally don't much care for cards. Chocolate, however, is difficult not to appreciate when I'm shovelling it into my chocolate hole.
5	Also why am i picturing you as an anime girl in a love triangle with both guys fighting for your heart? One guy is your sensitive musical childhood friend and the other a firey sports guy. Which one will win???
3	I consider myself as an artistic person (a very typical ISFP) and I would highly appreciate the time that people took to go an extra mile for a gift
3	I really like chocolate :)
3	I prefer practical stuff (if I don't have gloves for winter, giving me some gloves will make you an attentive person and I love that), but if you're artsy, make something that you know that ISFP will like.
2	Loads of guys like handmade stuff. I bet theyll love it. Why not do both the cards and chocolate? Then u cant go wrong :)
2	I personally would love to receive a gift like that. It really shows you care about them and have a lot of great memories including them. It's not just a handmade gift, it's a handmade gift which serves as a tangible reminder of your experiences together.\n\nISFP-wise, I think 'the artist' type would appreciate the artistic effort that went into making the cards, enjoying looking at the little details you included.\n\n(and there's no reason you couldn't include chocolate too)
15	Purging friendships	DAE do this? Like go through your Facebook every year or so and delete two thirds of the people? Or decide you’re “over” certain mutual friends or acquaintances in real life, and start systematically burning bridges?\n\nMaybe I shouldn’t say “systematically”, because with me it almost feels like an internal tantrum or something. Pent up aggression that boils over and next thing I know I’m nuking every relationship except for the two or three people dearest to me.\n\nI thought I’d outgrown these urges but no. \n\nPeople never talk about the misanthropic side of ISFPs, and I’m not sure why?\n\nI often quote [this guy](https://youtu.be/qIqeXSYc8nE) even though that movie is old and ridiculous because this scene is hilariously dead-on.
8	The older (and more misanthropic) I get, the more I think I’ve been an ISFP this whole time. I love a friend purge. *Love* them. 
6	Yeah I've done the Facebook friend sweep. I've also ghosted many many friends I felt were dragging me down, and I always feel guilty for how I go about it but in the long run I'm always glad I did. Unless I have a **very** strong connection with somebody it's very easy for me to leave them. 
6	Oh hell yes. Facebook friend purges are cathartic. Never realized misanthropy was an ISFP thing but I can totally relate. People are usually hit or miss with me, love em or leave em.
6	No I just delete my Facebook. It’s kinda tedious to go through all my friends and decide if I wanna burn bridges or not. 
3	Yeah i used to back when i was on there. Eventually i just deleted my Facebook because i barely used it anyways and i hated having to decide whether or not to wish ppl happy birthday or not all the damn time.
3	Fuuuck I haven’t watched this movie in forever \n\nBut YES, can relate. I love going on my huge unfollow sprees on twitter and the rare occasion I use Tumblr. 
2	I'm at the point where I figure "if you're close enough to me, you have my contact info. Whether you use it or not is up you. If you don't use it, that's fine too."
39	I believe we are the personality type to “truly get it”	This is just my opinion, but I believe our true reason to be here is to simply live and fully be here in the present. It helps us understand ourselves better when we are isolated, alone with ourselves. We can extraordinarily feel the sensations around us, even to an intuitive level. \n\nThis is what I’ve noticed, but our interior functions really give us a benefit to living in the present moment.\n\nEdit: we all kind of ‘get it’, despite personality type. However, this is just a recurring thing I’ve noticed often with other ISFPs.
20	I agree, but on the other hand, doesn't everyone have their own definition of "I get it"? I mean I completely agree with your post, but an INTP might think something like "I truly get it, life is about gaining knowledge".
17	One of the peak moments in my life is when I am truly present in the moment while walking in nature. I immerse myself with the surroundings and all the physical sensations in their rawest forms. I felt truly alive for the first time. It felt so vibrant and rich... i would closely observe the rocks, trees, leaves and flowers and see their beauty... 
14	yes. from my experience it seems we feel all the misery and pleasure completely through. no matter how much we try to numb ourselves to the experience.. it’s never over until we feel it. if that makes sense? totally agree 
2	You described my life purpose
2	Yes. I feel this, bro.
3	So I think I was mistyped before...	I decided to take the test again just because I haven't taken it in a while, and I was surprised when I got ISF**J**, not ISF**P**. So i decide to look through the description to see if there's any reason why it's different, besides the fact that my Judging and Perceiving has always been very balanced. There was one thing that resonated with me so much I knew I had to be an ISFJ.\n\n"*Given how generous Defenders are with their warm praise and support, it’s not surprising that others enjoy their company enough to call them friends. The challenge is to be considered a friend back – people with the Defender personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of Defenders’ friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little.*"\n\nThe person who I'd consider my closest friend, we only met a year ago, and it was by talking to each other consistently in class everyday our friendship grew. I think after reading this I was mistyped for a while. \n\nAs for how my results came out this time:\n\n- Introverted: 97%\n\n- Observant: 58%\n\n- Feeling: 86%\n\n- Judging: 54%\n\n- Turbulent: 64%\n\nSo i'm actually an ISFJ instead
2	Too many people take these tests online, the real myers briggs test includes a lot more and gives a clear result. Yet again, it costs a lot of money. 
1	Yeah but i feel like most isfps will relate to this too. 
16	What quotes resonate with you deeply?	I want to know what kind of quotes ISFPs resonate with deeply. \n\nFor me, I love Eckart Tolle quotes about the present moment, the human ego, inner peace and stuff. His book, the power of now really changed how I see the world and made me way less depressed. \n\nAlso I like Lao Tzu’s quotes with water metaphors. \n\n“Water is the softest thing yet it can penetrate mountains and earth. This shows clearly the principle of softness overcoming hardness.”\n\nOther honorable mentions include Rupert Spira’s quotes and Rumi’s poetry. \n
15	“If you’re not going to swim deep with me, then get out of my waters” 
8	This doesn't resonate with me, but I have to remind me this everyday so I won't fuck up: "Complaining about a problem without posing a solution is called whining", from Roosevelt.
7	"So tell me what you want what u really really want ill tell you what i want what i really really want i wanna i wanna i wanna i wanna i wanna really really really wanna ziga zig ah. "\n\n-Maya angelou
3	I love any Alan Watts quotes, but recently I heard a quote from Laozi that really resonated with me.\n\n“Love the world as yourself. Then, you can care for all things.”
2	To go along with quotes similar to yours. I like "Duty is heavier than a mountain, death is lighter than a feather."
2	"Sometimes they might've not made a mistake. We just didn't think the same way"
2	\n"I can't go back to yesterday, because I was a different person then." - Lewis Carroll
1	It changes and I have many. But nowadays I really like Rumi, he soothes my soul.
1	Do what you want, \n\ndo all you can, \n\nbreak all the fuckin rules\n\nand go to hell with superman \n\nand die like a champion\n\n(Optional) AH HEY

40	Idk what this drawing means but im happy with how it turned out!	
6	My interpretation:\n\nBipolar? Or maybe the two sides of human. Good and bad, or left brain/ right brain (nice brain representation!) ... where on one side, worms (symbolising rot) turning into caterpillars and butterfly(s) (symbolising metamorphosis and change). On the 'bad' side you have depersonalization ... where life is almost unreal, or like a simulation, and everything is meaningless (1s and 0s, like in a computer). On the other side, sunshine and clouds/ flowing water ... symbolising abundance/plenty, in contrast to the murky waters on the 'dark' side. An eye symbolising intuition .. or Ni, maybe? (An Eye/ N-I, geddit? lol). And in the midst of all this, the far reaching arms of Satan!!!! (goat, traditionally symbolising satan ... from Christian symbolism, as in, the sheep and goats etc etc).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNice drawing BTW, I love ISFP art, you guys are the bestest.
3	I really enjoy it!
7	Idk if its kosher to post your art here but r/infp ppl do it so. Sorry if its annoying i just wanted to share it somewhere.
3	That's great! 
2	Nice! I have been wanting to see ISFP art work. It’s pretty detailed. It looks like sth I would draw too! 
2	I like the illuminati satanic feel!
2	I see it like a balance kind of picture, the light and the dark. I noticed something resembling words, so maybe the thoughts vs the clarity of our minds? And us as the center, the natural core? I’m just throwing ideas out there, but that’s a vague interpretation of mine 
1	OMG, i'm obsessed with this :\^)
26	What are your thoughts on all the types?	For me:\n\nINTJ: Kinda like inverted ISFPs (Ni Te Fi Se vs Fi Se Ni Te). Generally speaking, great people which I tend to have the best conversations with. \n\nINTP: On a surface level, I can get along well with them, but a really deep friendship is a bit hard. Tend to be very hit or miss people in general, to me. \n\nINFJ: Like an ISFJ, but more relaxed and easier to have deep conversations with. I tend to mistype them for INTPs when get serious, though. \n\nINFP: Pretty cool people all around, but I sometimes get this feeling that they secretly dislike ISFPs for some reason. \n\nISTJ: I don't have much experience with them, but from what I can tell they're basically more tough and less open minded INTJs. They usually mean well, though. \n\nISTP: I get along with them really well. The only thing I tend to avoid around them is more feeling oriented topics, since alongside INTPs I consider them the least feeling type. Tend to be quite polite to me as well. \n\nISFJ: Generally really nice people, but you don't want to make them mad, they're either Jesus 2 or Hitler. They have this weird ability to just disable their feelings altogether when they get serious. I can't say I understand their selfless attitude, though. Probably Fi vs Fe. \n\nISFP: Kinda hard to say, actually. I just see this type as me. \n\nENTJ: Less likeable INTJs (tert Fi vs inf Fi, I think), and more bossy (Ni dom vs Te dom).\n\nEDIT: Maybe a bit of a hard description, I think they can be pretty cool too. They're just harder to connect to than an INTJ. Having an ENTJ gf sounds pretty cool\n\nENTP: If every personality type was a candy, this one is crystal meth. To me, completely random and indecipherable. They're quite similar to a chimpanzee in some ways, at first they seem okay, and they may even appear to like you, but then after a few minutes they may just rip off your face for the lols. On paper you'd think they're basically extroverted INTPs, but they have this really vicious way of talking and toying with everything INTPs don't. I feel like they're wielding some sort of knife that only ISFPs can see, other types don't really mind them. \n\nENFJ: Outside of the excessive "you can do it! believe in yourself" thing (let me be self-conscious!) they're great people.\n\nENFP: I call this one the glittery lesbian type, pretty cool people. \n\nESTJ: I know very little about this type, but I once had this teacher who I guess was one. A pretty nasty person, extremely by the book and would punish you for about anything, with a big nasty smile.\n\nESTP: A of a weird version of the ISTP. Much more aggressive than ISTPs, they tend to be the stereotypical bully (that spends way too much time getting tanned). OR they're that cool friend who's always doing something reckless. Not a fan of ISFPs, as far as I can tell. \n\nESFJ: Friendly, but something overbearing. \n\nESFP: A weird version of the ISFP. On paper they seem like great people, but they're kinda like ESTPs to me. Can be really intimidating in groups, tend to be ridiculously loud and will shout profanity at you for no reason. OR they're like that ESTP friend, except a bit more pep talk-y and warm.
13	>I get the feeling that INFPs secretly dislike us\n\nI do not dislike ISFPs! I adore you. You have strong values just like us, but you act on them. You do things. \n\nAs an INFP who suffers from procrastination and lack of follow-through, I admire ISFPs. I actually wanted to turn into an ISFP (or an INFJ) when I was younger. Now I am cool with my type but that’s how much I envied your spontaneity and action.\n\nI also admire how down-to-earth you are. You do not think about pointless things. (Unless you are stuck in the Fi-Ni loop.)\n\nI imagine an ISFP’s head as a meadow where a calm breeze is ever blowing. \n\nI imagine my head as a deep sea cave where shining, rainbow-colored bubbles are ever forming.\n\nI want to lie down on that meadow sometimes and forget about everything.\n\nThe thing is, even though I adore you, I sometimes find it hard to connect to you. You are so tuned to the world. I am forever in my head. So I look at you distantly with a bit of longing. \n\n“You are such charming people. And I lack the capacity to keep you company.”\n\nDo not mistake this distant gaze as hidden hatred! That’s not it and never will be.
6	ESTP - pretty sure my boss is this type. Definitely intimidating, but I appreciate how he always seems energetic. He seems to like that I am easy to talk to. I feel like some estps find us boring if they don’t get to really know us\n\nISTP - I think of mostly quite people who aren’t afraid to say things others might feel uncomfortable with. Thats cool in my book. I always thought of istps as “cooler” isfps lol.\n\nENTJ - People who get shit done. I prefer not spending much time around this type just because I don’t want to get in there way. \n\nINTJ - My sibling is an INTJ, we get along great. I think my agreeableness nicely compliments the “I’m always right” mindset of INTJs lol. I never really agreed with the stereotype they’re arrogant.\n\nENTP - Funny, but also really mean. Entps seem to care about nothing while I care about EVERYTHING. I agree I think isfps see them holding a knife that other types just don’t see.\n\nINTP - Creative but also seem like robots.  My favorite musician David Byrne is supposed to be an INTP so that’s cool\n\nENFP - Friendly people. These are the best people to work with because they usually seem quite happy\n\nINFP - ISFPs but with poetry, imagination, and impractical goals lol. One infp I knew was kind of a self centered dick but that’s just one person.\n\nISTJ - Scary if you piss them off. Generally though  pretty level headed people.\n\nESTJ - My dad’s type. Tough, letting criticism roll right-off their back, a trait I have always been jealous of. Like ENTJs they get shit done. Nicer than people give them credit for, they are careful about showing it.\n\nENFJ - Very optimistic people. I feel like a lot of my favorite teachers/Professors were ENFJs\n\nINFJ - My mom’s type. Pretty similar to isfps honestly accept infjs seem to have a greater want to help other people. In my experience this type is really passive aggressive.\n\nISFJ - My best friend’s type. Super nice people. Has a strong desire to help others in need.\n\nESFJ - Very outgoing people who can sometimes come off as unintentionally annoying from their desire for everyone else to be happy.\n\nESFP - People who love attention basically, not thats necessary a bad thing. Can be extremely fun to be around and they talk non stop. Difficult to have deep conversations with.\n\nISFP - My type! I think it’s difficult to get to know other ISFPs because I don’t think we ever set out to meet new people unless we have to. Soft spoken and artsy in some way. \n\n\n
3	INTJ: every INTJ I’ve met I’ve had some strange unspoken connection to.  Extreme introverts. Very clever yet calming people. \n\nENTJ: really go go go. It seems like that can’t really be happy unless they’re moving on to the next goal. Very blunt and honest. Enjoyable people if they are not at work I’d say? \n\nISTJ: can be extremely controlling and narrow minded. But can also be very caring and dedicated people. Tend to get along with them pretty well in short bursts.\n\nESTJ: conversational masters and very extroverted. I really enjoy every ESTJ I’ve ever met. They’re very motivated and a force of nature. Tend to care way too much about what people think of them/they’re status. Very smart as well.\n\nENTP: funny, witty, moral-less bastards. Fun to be around but the amount of data and just general bs they spew out can be exhausting. Tried to date one once and it was hilariously abysmal. \n\nINTP: a less crazy and talkative version on the ENTP. Capable of keeping an alarming amount of information in their heads. The mad scientist stereotype rings pretty true for this one. \n\nESTP: the cool guys. the mean guys. the salespeople. Don’t have much else to say. \n\nISTP: zen-surfer type people. Crazy hardworking when they are interested in the task. Very gifted  with tactile/mechanical problem solving. VERY unemotional. \n\nENFJ: “I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO BE HAPPY” and super pissy if everyone isn’t happy. Can be very, very manipulative but generally just want the best for people. Conversational masters as well.\n\nINFJ: very talkative around people they are comfortable with. A lot of the ones I know have photographic memories. Social chameleons and fake extroverts. Dedicated to people they care about but will door slam them and never look back for some pretty obscure reasons. \n\nESFJ: money-pinchers. Very responsible and dependable. Obsessed with their image and can be very manipulative. But typically very kind. \n\nISFJ: I love dem. They are my friends. Very very caring and less obsessed with their image. They are capable of putting up with A LOT. Extremely strong people.\n\nESFP: THE ULTIMATE EXTROVERT. Heavily invested in the overall “experience” of life. Thrill seekers. Will talk to anyone about anything. \n\nISFP: [it me](https://me.me/i/you-are-a-shrew-sensitive-creative-paranoid-none-19079821) \n\nENFP: stoked about everything. Very very enthusiastic. Need their alone time more then any other extrovert. Very fun and warm people while being extremely intelligent. The one I know is fluent in Hebrew and has is a PhD. 10/10 would be cousins with one again. \n\nINFP: i don’t think i’ve ever met one \n
3	Haha I liked your descriptions 😂
3	A few of these typesi dont know if ive ever encountered so ill just skip those ones\n\nIntj: this is my bfs type so im biased in favor of them. they always have this cool smart vibe and im always impressed with them. Some intjs ive met have been arrogant assholes tho. \n\nIntp: i really admire them and i wish is was as smart and logical as they are. They have this Fe mask tho that is sometimes well developed and sometimes not and i find it hard to maneuver around because i can see it. They are usually cool tho.\n\nInfp this is my sisters type! Shes the only one i know personally so i cant really say much about them but although they can be pretentious as fuck theyre fun and funny and thoughtful. I dont really speak the Ne language tho.\n\nInfj: never met one\n\nIstj: only one i know is my bfs brother who i havent conversed with much. Hes really kinda mechanical and doesnt talk much. He is super quiet around me but my bf says hes a pretty cool guy and very level headed and overall chill although stubborn about certain things.\n\nIstp: they are cool folks i can usually get on with them ok. \n\nIsfj: my best friend is one. Theyre always super caring and can be gossipy but they are in general kind hearted folk. I always like the isfjs i meet.\n\nIsfp: thats me and honestly i get along best with this type. We are just chill people and yea. Can be passive aggressive and aloof but i get it so i dont mind it that much.\n\nEntj: ugh i really dont like entjs that much and im not really equipped to interact to them well. They are always so smart and opinionated tho so i admire that about them. I wish i could be a little more like them.\n\nEntp: i dont really like interacting with entps because they are kinda full of themselves in my experience and they dont really see me anyway.\n\nEnfj: they are really likable people and theyre fun to be around but yeah i dont interact well with extroverts in general but theyre cool ppl.\n\nEnfp: it seems a lot of theater ppl are this type. I love enfps theyre amazing.\n\nEstj: very annoying type when immature. When mature and humble they make great managers.\n\nEstp: im not sure if ive met one im not too familiar with this type.\n\nEsfj: the ones ive met have been bitchy so idk what the non bitchy ones are like but im sure there are cool ones.\n\nEsfp: i like them. the ones ive known have been flirty and funny and fun to be around. I love what they add to the atmosphere.\n\nYeah any Fe users i have trouble interacting with. I have trouble interacting with Fe in general. Looking back I guess these have not been very good descriptions but more like a "like vs not like" typa thing oh well xD
3	no idea what i'm doing\n\nINTJ: Most of my friends. The coolest and easiest to be around once theyre socialised. I'm not sure they understand tenderness, though. \n\nINTP: Hilarious. Dry but silly wit.\n\nINFJ: Don't think I know any. Not really drawn to them online. \n\nINFP: Do seem to often fit the romantic/floral or emo/goth thing. am a bit in awe of the clever ones that have a sense of perspective/know themselves. \n\nISTP: I guess I've worked mostly with these. I'm indifferent (which can be relatively good). And it's probably the 'persona' I initially adopt/disguise myself with in masculine environments (work).\n\nISFP: Add value just by being a calm presence. Maybe a bit preoccupied. Cool, but struggle to cultivate?\n\nENTJ: I don't get them at all.\n\nENTP: Mischievous. Challenging, but in a good way (in small doses). Seem to like me because i play with them, but i can't keep up for long.\n\nENFJ: I don't know any.\n\nENFP: I relate a bit, because I think they're also stuck in the present moment a bit too much (even though they fantasise), flitting about with their ideas. makes them a bit childlike; fun, but possibly temperamental/capricious.  \n\nESTJ: no idea\n\nESTP: no idea. I guess i'm oblivious to ES people. masomanos\n\nESFJ: ?? \n\nESFP: I think I know a couple. rambunctious and fun. can't fully relax around them though. i might have completely the wrong type in mind
7	Pinterest??	Do you guys have an unexplainable obsession with pinterest??? I just rediscovered it recently and its like running 10+ tumblr blogs with different themes I'm literally drowning in aesthetics I love it
4	I'm actually a few days sober.
1	I honestly don't really use pinterest. Maybe I just haven't given it a fair chance. 
1	Get out of my head.
1	\n\nI enjoy Pinterest for the most part, I like to make it look super organized and then pick certain board cover themes so my page looks more ~*aEsthetiC~~~  amg\n\nOther than that, it can get lonely without the whole social feature, but that’s also what makes it so great. Haven’t seen any drama!
1	I was addicted to Pinterest for a while. Decided to drop it mostly to be more "productive". In reality I've just swapped Pinterest for Reddit.
1	This is my exact obsession, and it’s one of the few things that I’m a perfectionist on!
9	Do I seem like an ISFP?	As the title says I can’t  really determine my type. I have gone through my functions stack and I’ll give you examples.\n\nI know I am an introvert. I am very laconic. I believe actions should speak louder than words. Words are powerful and they are even more powerful when seldom used. I am very witty but I try not to speak. I let other people do the talking. You can learn a lot about a person by being quiet and watch them insecurely speak a million words. You learn even more if their words contradict their actions. Eventually people drain me and if I am around people for too long I get very cynical. I hope for the best in people but I often see the worst.\n\nI am sure I use Se. When I am not working it is in a lazy way. I am very laidback and want to have a good time. When I am working (Electrical mechanic), I am very dedicated, I believe in doing quality work to the best of my ability. If I didn’t do any less than my best that would feel an awful lot like stealing. But off work I can be a couch potato probably because I’m tired and enjoy the break. I like poetry, books, history, psychology and mythology. Things that help me explore emotional depths and understand human behavior and thinking. I also enjoy art, music, and cinema.\n\nAs for Fi or Ti. Honestly this is where I struggle. I have strong morals. I am a traditional, hard working male who sees the value in traditions and not in a blind faith sort of way but I can also back up the traditions I value strongly with logic. But I will oppose traditions that don’t make sense. I have torn apart every major religion and found the flaws in them. This rocked my world as I was raised Christian. I refuse to do things that go against my morals. I strongly believe in honor, family, and protecting the weak. \n\nI want to go ahead and say that I respect whatever you believe but for me this is my story and what I have found to be true. As I got older and studied the Bible, I found many inconsistencies. This lead to a kick where I broke down every book and chapter and found every contradiction. Everything that didn’t line up. I also did this with the other major abrahamic religions. I actually studied Hebrew on my own. I basically witnessed the biblical story evolve from polytheism, to a henotheistic cult, to a temple cult, to a monotheistic cult, to a dualistic cult, and then to a messianic cult and finally to a Paulianic cult. All roads lead back to polytheism and psychological archetypes. Again, if you’re Christian, I mean no offense. I respect what you believe, I just couldn’t believe anymore after delving back so far. My current beliefs revolve around forces of nature, archetypes and being a good person. I just never understood how a culturally Western European person could find solace in an Abrahamic eastern religion. It clashed with my views of honor, family, and justice. \n\nI don’t know if the drive to understanding different religions was via Fi or Ti. Being Christian always felt wrong to me. But using history, comparative mythology, and psychology I came to peace and found my current gods which feels right. I don’t know if that was me using Fi and Te or Ti and Fe.\n\nAs for Ni. I can use that for work. I am a great troubleshooter. I can look at a circuit and pretty much take it apart and figure out how it works and I can visualize how wires are run but when it comes to planning for the future, I suck. I am organized, a minimalist, but I wouldn’t call myself someone who needs routine. I prefer improvising. But I see the value in making lists and delegating tasks because part of my job is seeing the big picture on projects.\n\nI may have inferior Te or Fe.\n\nI am prone to explosive fits of rage if someone tries to test me or treads over my beliefs. I am also protective and hate bullies.\n\nI also feel the need to over organize and clean when I am stressed out which I hear can be a Te thing.\n\nI am leaning towards ISFP based on my strong values and desire to be who I am supposed to be and not fit a mold. I am very rebellious. I get competitive. I am an Enneagram 8.  On the exterior I appear cold and calculated until you get to know me. Hard shell and soft interior for those I love. I am very private and never tell anyone my struggles or hardships. Only reason I am being open here is it’s reddit which is anonymous.\n
4	This actually sounds a lot like ISFP. This type is often able to use its analytical side very well, which is why you might be confused about the T and F.
1	I'm sure you use Se to a large extent, but I see more Ti than Fi in this post. High Ti and low Fe usually doesn't want to follow social convention and morals just for the sake of it. They do so when it makes logical sense to them. That's characteristic of Ti, it wants to trust in its own logic and rules, instead of anyone else's which makes them rebellious. It becomes a key part of their sense of self. Of course that is carried over to morals as well, if they are inclined to be a good person. The transition to Fe (warmth) is sign of a maturing ISTP. :)
1	I thought I was an INFP for three years. Turns out I was an ISFP the whole time. Those secondary and tertiary functions are tricky, man.
1	You sound quite similar to me..
20	Feeling like I can't take initiative to try something new until I feel good enough?	Has anyone gone through this before? I have no friends in the city I live in and want to try and get out there by trying a new interest. There's an opportunity for me to do a sports thing on a weekly basis - but I don't want to socialize until I feel 'good enough' until I feel like other people's judgment won't affect me because I'll be good enough to me. Help?
3	Yeah that's hard. I'm always fighting with myself about this, but it helps if the activity is something I really, really like, or have always wanted to learn. I can ride the wave of enthusiasm for the thing, and by the time it fades, I'm hopefully comfortable enough in the activity or with the people that I forget to care about how good I am. The feeling does come back now and again, but it does get a little easier.\n\nAnother thing that helps is joining something where you're not the only new person. Taking a beginner or introductory class can take a lot of the pressure to be good off since everyone's kind of fumbling around together. I realise this may not be up to you in regard to the sports thing you mentioned, but it's a way to kind of desensitise yourself to this feeling/expand your level of comfort.
3	Sometimes you have to just go out there and just do it. Don’t think, do it
2	Yep. 
1	Yes I have!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you work out for the specific sport on your own (maybe set a goal of 10 sessions) or watch a certain number of hours of gameplay as preparation (then force yourself to go)? Or, ask people in the sports group if anyone is closer to beginner level or if they have tips or extra time to train with you?
4	Will an isfp ever forgive me after shutting me out of her life?	We were together for a year, it ended brutally. I'm not good with emotions nor understanding my own most of the time, i'm sure she already knows me better than i ever will. So my last message was that i forgive her and thanked her for everything she taught me. I don't necessarily agree with the way she went about everything it but i understand why. It's still kinda fresh and her decision is completely ultimatum right now and she don't want any contact with me at this current time and I don't see it happening any time soon maybe forever? concidering how everything went down. We hurt eachother back and forth for a while.. i'm just curious to know if a isfp can ever get contact again with somebody they had such a deep connection with? Even though they literally hurt them til the point of no return metaphorically speaking. Either way I'll focus on myself but I'm curious to know a general thumb on this one.
7	Mmm...from my experience, no. It depends on what you did. Like if you cheated, you could die, be reborn, die again, be born again and I still wouldn’t take you back. But that’s just me. If it violated her morals in some way, it’s a 99.9% chance it’s a no. But if not, she’ll probably forgive but she’ll never forget and you would have to work really hard to break down the walls she’s built back up. 
3	Without more context, this sounds like a no. If I shut someone out of my life, they need to earn back my trust, not offer me forgiveness for whatever wrongs I may have done( even if we both did hurtful things, if you’re the one wanting to reach out you may need to offer a little more that what might be strictly “fair”) For me, being offered forgiveness for a both-fault situation feels condescending and would likely harden my heart to any further interaction. I personally can’t just exchange sorries and move on, it would need to be worked through and discussed (which it sounds like you guys have already tried to do?)
2	As an ISFP, it takes me a long time to forgive (if I seem to immediately, obviously I don’t). However, I never forget. Despite what happened, I will remember specific bits and pieces that seem to repeat in my head. It reminds me of the past, making it hard to simply let go of what happened.
36	Why are ISFPs portrayed as soft, wimpy, absolutely harmless, unambitious bunny-flowers on online MBTI forums?	This really gets on my nerves. Most of these portrayals feel like they're written by INFPs who don't have a clue about ISFPs. Neither I nor the ISFPs I know concur with any of the rubbish written about us. 
20	I'm pretty sure I choked somebody before, its just a matter of irritating us the right way that people find out the dark side first hand. 
11	I don’t know why this is either. I watched a very informative video on our cognitive function stack and it said that if our Ti (our “demon function”) is engaged then we can and will systematically destroy someone like no other type will.\n\n
10	Yeah I feel that Se gives ISFP a certain ruggedness that INFPs don’t have.
8	Muhahahahaha. That means it’s working! ;) 
5	I'm kind to people not because it's my nature. I'm kind because I make an active effort to be kind, because I care about people. It's exhausting being nice all the time. We ain't harmless.
5	It’s because rather than being a warrior, outgoing idea of strong, we’re the internal “water-is-strong-yet-sturdy” kind  of strong. It’s not expressed outwardly, unless it’s through some form of art (for me, at least), therefore, more than likely misinterpreted as weak or hippie.
3	Really? I find this description something xNTx say
2	Maybe y'all are mistyped.
2	I've always found INFPs to be the more 'soft'/sappy of the two, so I'm curious about why you think these things are written by INFPs? INFPs in my experience are more concept/thought driven than reality/action driven, and I would probably associate the latter with the 'ruggedness' some people mention here.\n\nOften I think people mix up or conflate ISF**P**s and ISF**J**s. I'm not saying ISFJs are 'wimpy' or 'unambitious', but a high Fe user is probably more likely to let themselves be a doormat than a Fi user.\n\nI also think introverted feelers in general get more of an 'uwu precious widdle cinnamon rol' typecasting.\n\n&#x200B;
4	It’s cuz INFPs are.....delusional. I’m sorry to say. 
1	What forums? 
1	As an xNTx , the ones I know kind of are... in some very good ways and other unattractive ways 
1	I thought INFP were supposed to be the bunny-flowers? I've always seen ISFP portrayed as "2aesthetic4u" on forums.\n\nEither way, they're just rediculous stereotypes.
36	Fi doms in a mood.	
7	I get more of an INFP vibe from that image, tbh.
4	This is so good. 😂
2	I know every type can have strong feelings. I mainly wanted to post this cool pic here xD\n\nArtist: rebecca kirby or "reweki"\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reweki/
2	Hmmm I don't think about anything when I draw, if that's what the picture is saying. I just focus on doing well what I imagine. 
1	What are some non-sterotype questions I can ask to determine if someone is an introvert or an extrovert?	I have a friend who has social anxiety and it makes it hard to tell. I’m fairly confident about the rest of his type but I’m torn about the I/E part. \n\nYour thoughts are appreciated. Thanks!
3	i look at the pace they move and talk at, how immediately responsive they are to their environment and ideas brought up in a conversation, how "big" their energy is, how animated their face and body are, how much impulse control they seem to have, things like that.
21	ISFPs, is this description accurate as to how you respond to an emotional pain or trauma?	Will preserve social harmony, will act everyday as if nothing is wrong, won’t discuss and even deliberately hide suffering. Will be very much secretive as to what one’s really feeling. Might resent people not feeling his/her pain. (Opposing Fe)\n\nWill think a lot of other possibilities and ways of getting out of the pain including scenarios of future being out of suffering, but all will still be negative. Will think that it would be even worse once they get out of the trauma. Specially when in the process of being okay again, might at times think that things will get much worse in the future and would rationalize the idea and believe it as a fact somehow. (Trickster Ne, Demon Ti)\n\nPrevailing negative thoughts would be thinking they should not be trying new things anymore as it is what gets them to trouble, they should just stick to what is comfortable, etc. (Critic Si)
11	Very accurate description of my emotional life. I have a real problem telling others of my own issues, despite being the main person in my friend group to hear the problems of others, who they come to vent to, etc. this, along with unsupportive family has led to have low self-confidence, and problems with depression and anxiety. \nArguably the best part of 2018 has been the strides I’ve made in being open to friends I trust and know actually care about me.
5	Could you give a real life example? 
2	Yes, yes, yes
1	Yes.
5	How do your cognitive function pairs (Fi-Te, Se-Ni) manifest in your daily life?	Have you also experienced using them and making a shit out of yourself? How did you react? Was it worth it somehow?\n\nAlso how about your shadow functions? According to Beebe, for an ISFP, Fe as opposing function will manifest when the ego is hurting or if there is some kind of trauma that the ISFP is experiencing. Ne and Ti will manifest sometimes too, specially during the aftermath of a trauma.
1	Sounds interesting.\nCan you explain the same thing for estps ? 
1	Advice on figuring out where I stand with an ISFP	Hi all. ENFJ male here... I've gone on a few dates with a girl who told me she's an ISFP. She's great in so many ways, and we have tons of chemistry, and a lot in common. Things were going well until she flaked out on a date, and then sent me a follow-up text saying she's been needing to spend some time focusing on herself, but she still likes me and wants to see me again. I told her it's all good and to let me know when she wants to meet up.\n\nI wasn't sure if she was letting me down easy, so I decided to leave the ball in her court, and leave it up to her to initiate another date. Since then, nearly two weeks ago, she's texted me cute things but hasn't initiated another date.\n\nI'm not an idiot, and know that when someone bails without rescheduling, it's a bad sign, but this girl seems unique, which is why I'm not sure how to read this situation. I've read up on ISFPs and understand that you frequently need alone time, and that you're usually sincere when you communicate your feelings about people. \n\nI'd like to ask her out again, but I'm worried about scaring her away, or seeming inconsiderate if she's still wanting of alone time. Selfishly, I'd like to know where I stand with. If she's not into me, it'd be nice to know so I can move on.
2	Just tell her that you don't want to be strung along and don't want to waste her time/yours. Or if you really want to wait for her, perhaps you should date other people simultaneously 
2	I'd give her a little less attention and if she just uses you for posts/attention say you're busy but could schedule a meetup if she wants. That'd light a fire under my ass.
1	Ask her if she has had enough alone time and that you since you really like her, you do want to spend more time together instead of wasting time.
52	If this aint me	
5	An Instagram photo I really like - Share some current IG faves please!

11	So it's another year without friends on my birthday	I have work colleagues that are sweet but I took the day off from work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you celebrate your birthdays? All I've planned is a massage and a movie.
9	I have done this for so long that I don't even care anymore. Birthdays are a reminders for me, that how much I suck socially.
4	Happy birthday! It’s also mine today!\nI turned 22 and I’m not planning on any kind of big celebration, I’m gonna pay couple of rounds of drinks to a few friends later and that’s it. I don’t see it as something to be celebrated but I do see it as my day. Feels good 
2	I like to travel and experience new things for my birthday.  This year my small group of friends forced me to celebrate with them after I got back from my trip.
2	One of my favorite birthdays was one where im completely alone. i had perfect weather, i had a nice meal of sushi which is my fave food, i watched a movie id been meaning to see, i bought a cute hat, i took my beautiful red vintage bike out on an evening ride and i happened to find a deer family of 5 and watched them in silence for  20 minutes while the sun went down. A perfect day and i pretty much talked to nobody. It can be really awesome if you let it!! I understand your feeling though. Hope you have a good birthday, whether you see people or not op!! Hang in there. Happy birthday:)
2	I’m turning 25, so this year I’ll just cry and await my midlife crisis.\n\nJust kidding, I’m already going through it.\n\n(I usually just like to watch movies. Then I do my least favorite thing, which is awkwardly responding to Facebook birthday posts. I should just deactivate on my bday LOL)
2	Happy Birthday, pickle.
1	Massage and a movie sounds like some good self-love. I hope you enjoy your day. 
2	"Myers Briggs Type Indicator test is a joke"	
14	The people who just instantly say "its not science so its automatically lies and bullshit" dont actually take the time to look into the theory behind it which is really detailed and substantive. Nothing like a buzzfeed quiz.\n\n Most humans dont know themselves as well as they think they do most humans lie about themselves to keep up the ideal version of themselves in their head. And *thats* why the scores are so liable to change. Based on your mood you could decide youre more one way than another if youre not really trying to be as objective about yourself as possible which most people arent.\n\nIts not provable or testable but with the amount of anectdotal evidence it has in its corner you cant just dismiss it as nothing. \n\nIt should only be used for personal self discovery though it should never be a deciding factor on who gets a job or not, that i agree with.
5	I disagree, but I respect the author's opinions and beliefs. <3
5	The author is under the impression that mbti describes behavior when in fact it is used to describe how a person thinks and how their brain operates. Behavior will obviously change as you develop as a person. People with changing results lack the information needed to accurately type themselves. It takes a decent amount of work to be able to type yourself. Just a garbage article based on ignorance like most of the internet.
3	Saw it in at the top of my Google Feed and wondered what everyone would think of this. 
1	The MBTI, or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, is an instrument designed to assess how an person typically takes in, processes, and makes decisions about information from the world around them. Using a self-report questionnaire, the MBTI measures four psychological dimensions to sort people into 16 types, each with a unique profile of mental processes that drive an individual’s personality. MBTI type isn’t meant to predict behavior or label personality traits,however. **Its purpose is to look under the surface and find the “why”**. Used correctly, it can provide tremendously useful insight.\n\n## [How Does It Work?](https://my-personality-test.com/personality-type-indicator)\n\nThe core concept behind the MBTI is that we all have innate, individual differences in the ways our minds tend to perceive and utilize information — ***cognitive functions*** — which then influence the way we operate in the world. **These differences are viewed as natural preferences**, rather than absolutes, and none is considered superior to any other. Much like being left or right-handed, we have naturally dominant “*default*” preferences that we tend to feel more comfortable with and use more often. These cognitive functions are like tools in your mental toolbox. You can use any of them as needed, but there are some you tend to reach for more than others, and those are the ones that feel most familiar. When we engage our non-dominant functions, it can begin to feel awkward, unnatural, or uncomfortable, often leading us to feel psychologically “*worn out*” over time. The MBTI assesses these cognitive preferences across 4 separate dimensions, each of which is expressed as a dichotomy of two opposites: Extraversion vs. Introversion, Thinking vs. Feeling, Intuition vs. Sensing, and Judging vs. Perceiving. It is important to note that this terminology can be somewhat misleading, as the colloquial meanings are different from their technical definitions within the MBTI model.
11	help I've fallen for an ISFP and I can't get up	I'm an ENTP, how can I not mess this up?\n\n​\n\nI'm worried about draining him, overstimulating him, not being on the same page as him, not being sensitive enough for him, not being able to understand him, etc. Usually idgaf if I'm not "right" for the person I like, I just move onto the next one--but this guy is special. I am absolutely crazy about him and that's never actually happened to me before. I know that he likes me too but I think he's a bit worried about some of our differences and how that'll affect a potential relationship. That and he's too shy to make the first move lmao\n\n​\n\nSo, what can I do to ensure one of you guys I'll do my best to keep you happy? And what kinds of things can I do to keep you happy? 
16	I think be yourself tbh. We can sense “trying too hard” pretty easily. If he’s into you he’s into you. If not, you’ll move on to someone else who will appreciate you for who you are. And trust me, if he’s into you, he WILL make the first move. This is coming from a male ISFP. 
6	I hope this is helpful but I'm not sure if it will be. I was terribly into an ENTP a few years ago. I thought she was completely fascinating, always had interesting things to talk about and held out just enough about herself to be constantly intriguing. Best of all was that we were working on a very ambitious project together. I ended up breaking things off when she abandoned said project and refused to talk about it anymore. I think there was some mental health issues involved but she wouldn't address it. Created a very awkward schism and I couldn't trust her anymore, because she severed something she knew was very important to me. So open communication and trust is key, as with all relationships.\n\nENTPs have a tendency to come across as a bit closed off and superior, at least in my opinion. Try to remain open and available, but give them space. Show interest in what matters to them. Pay attention to any indications that they need some time alone and don't take it personally when they go quiet, but definitely hit them up after a day-ish to show you're thinking about them. 
3	I appreciate your efforts to make this happen. :)
3	Isfp guy here married to an entp woman. \nAll those fears are true for us from time to time. There are going to happen, you both just have to choose to been understanding. If he is getting over stimulated, let him be alone. If you don't understand him, ask questions or about way home telling you and Believe him even if you don't understand. Ect. 
2	Support him in his endeavors and leave him alone when he needs it.  I love that my current girlfriend leaves me alone to work on music, read a book or just relax by myself.  My mood and confidence can vary and she understands that and flows with it. \n\nOther than that, enjoy the ride!  
2	Provide them the fine balance of alone time and affection.
1	Question About ISFP?	i found this subreddit by accident, and read ISFP, whats it mean?\n\ni consider my self as introvert, but i dont know if i belong here, can u please guide me
6	Step 1: community info\nStep 2: suggested links 
19	Dae not even like texting that much?	I dont really text anyone and when someone texts me i take forever to answer because i just dont really ever want to text. I have few friends and it doesnt really bother me. I have one friend who messages me on messenger some what often but thats about it. I talk to my bf on the phone most nights but we dont really text much. Anyone else not good at keeping in contact with people? do i just barely need social contact or what? 
21	The only thing worse than texting is talking on the phone. 
7	I hate texting, I will often just look at the texts I receive and my brain just doesn’t want to put the effort into responding. And I end up feeling really bad and eventually respond but there’s definitely a block there. 
3	I used to be a "have-the-last-word" type. Nowadays, people irritate me to the point where I don't even respond anymore. Even my best friend or my SO rarely get a quick response anymore. I feel like I'm just getting older and have less fucks to give. Never really thought of it as a personality thing but now that you mention it, I might have to look into that a little further. 
2	I don’t really text that much, and if I do — I’m not the one who messaged you first. Of course, I’ll do it if we’re meeting up someplace or something like that but I’m not one to really do it for the pure fun of it.\nI realized I prefer just talking in person, probably because I can express myself the best that way. \nSo basically, no matter how much I like you, don’t expect to get a text from me anytime soon, lol.\n\nOh and also — I can relate with the feeling like you suck at keeping in contact. And honestly, that makes me feel like I’m being a bad friend sometimes. But at the same time it’s like, I’m just being me so I shouldn’t worry because my true friends will understand!
1	I hate texting. I never receive them anymore because I stopped responding a long time ago. I use messenger occasionally too to talk to my mom or my DH, but it's usually short and quick. 
1	I don't like communicating at all, I express myself like shit. Of course I do it because it's necessary, but since it's always trash text I don't do that often. \n\nWhich is kinda weird because sometimes I have this flow of words on me and just HAVE to express it to someone (sorry bf!)
1	Contrary to all the comments here, I like texting. I prefer it more than talking on the phone. It gives me time to think up of a good response. I don’t text 24/7. Only about half an hour in total a day. I often text to a friend of mine and share jokes and stuff. And then I would take a few days break from it. 
5	What are you searching for?	What do you want in a romantic relationship that might not be a typical ISFP desire? 
10	An extrovert that knows how to give space. 
5	A thinking dom who is in touch with their feelings.
3	What are typical ISFP desires?
2	>http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISFP_rel.html  \n  \nnot sure about my type (or mbti generally), but  \n  \n>**Strengths**  \nLikely to enjoy showing their affection through acts and deeds  \n  \n>**Weaknesses**  \nNeed to have their own space, and dislike having it invaded\n\n  \nI'm more like- once I've accepted someone, I share the personal space; and that's my idea of affection.  \nI'm not good at initiating affection.  \n  \n>Sexually, the ISFP approaches intimacy with complete attention, seriousness and depth.  \n  \nSure. But it can be silly, too.  \n  \n>ISFPs need positive affirmation to be happy and feel good about themselves. They need to be praised, although they are usually uncomfortable with "gushy" praise. The greatest gift their partners can give them is the expression of their affection and admiration.  \n  \nNahh...   \nI guess I need someone to be consistent with their behaviours.  \nThat the people in the relationship want to be around one-another is enough.
7	Do you tend to forget how you met your friends?	For some reason, I always forget how I met my friends in the first place.
5	No, but there are very few people I would consider friends.
4	Date an INFJ?	How do y’all feel about dating INFJs? What about it would you enjoy? What would you not like? 
11	I’m really good friends with a couple INFJ’s and I’ve got to know what they’re like over the years. I would definitely date an INFJ being an ISFP because if they’re in a relationship, they’re ALL in and I am totally down for that. Not to mention, they’re very empathetic and have a heart of gold. Seriously. \nI have an INFJ friend that got played so many times by friends or past boyfriends and I get so mad at her old friends/exes because honestly how could you pass up someone so great and treat them like shit? Anyways, they’re pretty introverted so they’ll respect your alone time and give you yours but don’t ever betray them. They have NO problem giving you the freeze/door slam. But other than that, just be genuine with them and try to be understanding. 
5	Oh boy. \n\nI dated a 23 y.o. male INFJ for a little over a year. I can write a novel on what went wrong and what I would have done differently in this relationship but I’m not going to bore you.\n\n\nThat being said, I think this pairing can work really well IF both types are mature. \n\n\nLet me know if you want me to expand. \n\n\n\n\n\n
2	It probably depends on how healthy/unhealthy they are. My BFF is an INFJ but when we dated we had some issues:\n\n\- she had/has a tendency to assume things quickly based on past (negative) experiences (Ni)\n\n\- I wanted to do things, experience stuff, lots of Se-stuff I guess, and she was more like 'calm down, I need alone time', I often felt distant from her.\n\n\- the Fe/Fi difference I think affected things most of all - I would often see her as being two-faced, and she'd often see me as being selfish. Our dynamic was often that she would bottle stuff up because she didn't want to 'burden' me/didn't feel right talking about HER feelings, while I opened up more and more and more in a desperate attempt to get communication going. We both had different ideas of the right thing to do when it came to talking about our feelings. I felt like it was best for both of us if I brought up something that bothered me, to resolve it. She felt that it was best for both of us if she kept any irritation/upset to herself to avoid conflict/hurting me.\n\nI definitely think I helped her get out more and experience the world, and she helped me calm down and enjoy being quiet with somebody else. INFJs are amazingly affectionate like everybody else has said, and she gave me some of the most heartfelt and meaningful gifts while we were together.
1	Was in a 2 1/2 year LDR with one. I'm sure it could've continued much longer if not an LDR, but not without clear problems. Emotions and care were without a doubt as strong as it could be. However, I was far more open and communicative than she was and it seemed to be a never ending struggle to get her to open up as much as I needed, even 2 years in. Despite that, she was always very understanding, but could never change for my sake no matter how patient I was.  \n\n\nAll I can say it was a very meaningful and fulfilling relationship. But it was also very tiring from the differences in our thinking when it comes to how we communicate our love and attachment. It's a promising pairing for sure, though. As long as you both have the patience. Same with most any pairing really.
5	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless [r/isf](https://www.reddit.com/r/estj)p would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ISFPs.\n\nThe ISFP survey link:\n\n [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRBRBZ7](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRBRBZ7) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ISFP please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.

3	Potential ISFP/INFJ Divorce... Advice?	Hi all ISFPs... \n\nA few days ago, my ISFP husband told me he wasn't happy in our marriage, and he wants to leave me. He's been very specific in communicating that he's not unhappy with me in particular, but instead seems to feel he's too broken/messed up for a healthy relationship. He's been a bit depressed lately, but things in our lives have generally been going well. For example, he recently got a raise at work, and we've been talking about having a baby soon. But, seemingly out of the blue, he's decided our marriage has to go... And that there's nothing I can do. He's expressed concern that I am not actually happy in the marriage, and he's expressed that he feels fear of hurting me. He's also said that he has unintentionally attached a lot of negative feelings (shame, anxiety) and childhood traumas to how he views me, and he feels like untangling them/removing those attachments is impossible. He says, "I wish I felt like I had another solution." \n\nThere is still a lot of love. We're still very friendly with each other. We even talked a long time and held hands for a while this morning while we talked. We seem to be communicating very well about our feelings, it feels like a two way street. I definitely don't want him to go, and other than asserting that he wants to go, he doesn't really seem like he actually wants to go. \n\nI'm not really sure what to do. I'm trying to let him go, but I'm simultaneously communicating about ways in which it (a) isn't entirely his fault that these bad attachments exist, and (b) that it isn't impossible to untangle those attachments, although it will take time. We've been through about 6-7 hours of couple's therapy together, which has already seemed to do a lot in exposing these bad attachments. I really just want him to keep giving us a chance to do the healing work we need to do... So, I'm mindfully asking him to stay another few months, so we can keep sorting through the hard stuff. He hasn't said yes, but... He also hasn't said no. So, in the meantime, I'm still going to try to actively work on changing my side of the bad attachments. I'm going to work on giving him a lot more positive feedback, and I am going to try to cut out being overbearing or too idealistic.\n\n**TL;DR Husband associates me with negative feelings/abuse, doesn't blame me, loves me a lot still, but wants to go anyways. I am asking him to stay another 2-3 months and keep giving therapy a chance to change our interactions.**\n\nThe question for ISFPs... What would you want, in this situation? What could make you feel more hopeful about the future in this situation? What could make you feel like you can affect real change? 
4	Perhaps he needs a change of pace in life. Can you both try taking a break and giving each other space for a couple months? He should go to individual therapy to sort out his mind before joining you again. Joining you again may mean something else besides marriage. I know as an ISFP I get really stuck in a rut when everything is routine and want to uproot and change anything I can control. Also do you know each other's love languages? Perhaps insight on that would help you love him in a way that he would resonate with. Best of luck, I can see that you love him so much and are so willing to work things out.
3	ISFPs dislike thinking about the future. Because often... the future comes to haunt them. Maybe you weren’t *there* enough for him? Not spontaneous enough. Only thinking about the future and planning all that. That could have felt like an invasion of Ni and Te to him. Instead of trying to find what to do to solve it, try to be with him in the here and now. Cook together. Travel together. Swim together. ISFPs can only look at the future in a positive light when their present life is full of action and spontaneity and things to explore. \n\nOf course. There is a high chance that my advice is misdirected and inaccurate. But I don’t even know you two. So excuse me if I’m assuming incorrectly. \n\nGood luck. 
2	Oh noes! I’m INFJ, 38/F, married 6 years to ISFP. We exchanged a few words very briefly in one of the threads a while back, but I’ve been silently rooting for you ever since I found out you had an ISFP. I hope that things work out!
2	Any sort of this talk prior to getting married? If not why is he only now bringing this up? Any chance hes unhappy with his job despite the on paper success? 
11	Sooo i think im an isfp..	i've been mistyping as istp but barely on the t and i keep trying to answer the test questions more honestly/accurately and looking stuff up if i don't understand.. and bam, it's starting to make sense why i do not like fixing things and am not good with my hands. also i feel like when i am around my friends i am more outgoing and friendly than an istp(although may be stereotyping) and i've heard stuff like that is the least istp thing i've ever heard and stuff but online. still only f by 3% but still. makes sense.\n\nsooo... yeah just thought you ALL wanted to know... so thats why i posted.. here.. on this isfp board.. yup does my humor resonate or are you just not on the same level of ogoj(original gangster orange juice) as me. my rap name is le pimp, i AM.. a lyrical genius
1	Welcome! We hope you enjoy your stay.\n\nAnd I love your rap name. ;)
13	Do you feel you are a lazy person?	I quite frequently dip into low energy. I can't understand those who are go go go...is this an ISFP thing?
21	very. nearly didn't comment, because of laziness. 
10	I am unless I'm very excited about something 
7	60% of the time and then 40% of the time i get in a mood where i need to be working on something constantly (Te grip).
3	Yeah. Not sure if it's an ISFP thing, quite a lot of ISFPs seem to be rather enthusiastic and like to do stuff.
2	Absolutely not. 
2	Yup. I have loooaads of stuff backed up that i need to do and yet day after day i continue to do none of it. Still waiting for the sense of urgency to come and motivate me to work but its been several weeks now and it hasnt come.
1	Yep 
1	Depending of the current mood, if i spend a day or more without doing nothing i feel bad and start to feel depressed so i try to stay active 
1	Visiting INFP here, oh god definitely.\n\nApparently ISFP’s are more productive because of the Sensor trait?
5	Is it me or are INFPs much more common (at least on the internet) than ISFPs?	
7	I think there is a lot of bias toward N that factors into mistyping
6	a lot of ENFPs think they're INFPs because they confuse introversion with high intuition. ESFPs don't seem to have the same problem.
6	Which anime character(s) do you relate to the most?	Anime watchers of r/isfp, which anime character or characters have you found the most relatable to yourself?\n\nI just realized that I related to Shiny Chariot (both her bad and good traits) from Little Witch Academia the most. (I could see a lot of ISFP qualities in her and I think she's definitely an ISFP.)
11	I relate to the Elric brothers ressurected mom from fullmetal alchemist because I'm a fucking abomination and somebody should put me out of my misery already.
3	Don't really relate to any, but Sasuke probably the most. Even just because of the "I dislike many things, don't have many things I like" thing.
2	Spike from Cowboy Bebop
2	Kiki from Kiki's Delivery Service and Naota Nandaba from FLCL
1	Yotsuba
1	If you’ve watched Hibike Euphonium, definitely Kumiko.
1	Ichimaru Gin
1	Ichinose Kotomi
1	Haven't ventured outside of Ghibli much, so I'll say the chick from Only Yesterday.
1	Hawkeye from FMAB. Always in the back, but meaningful for those who are in the front. I also compare myself to Akatsuki from Log Horizon.\n\nNever saw myself as a protagonist.
1	Yoh from Shaman King
1	Isai from the SSBM Documentary
1	Aqua from konosuba even tho she is extroverted. ;) [Aqua](https://i.imgur.com/z5CRYTf.gif)\nLittle Witch Academia is great btw :O
1	Shikamaru
8	How does Te manifest in the isfp personality?	I think i am least aware of Te. I read something that said becoming aware of your least dominant function helps you gain a sense of wholeness and balance.
3	Straight from Thought Catalog:\n\n\n\nInferior Extroverted Thinking:\n\n\nAs an inferior function, Te originally manifests as the inability to set one’s external desires or plans into motion.\n\n\nAs Te matures, the user finds themselves steadily more able to source the resources they require to make their dreams a reality. They also find themselves developing the ability to express their thoughts to others in a straightforward, logical manner.\n\n\nThe inferior-Te monologue (prior to maturation): “I have many goals I want to accomplish but often have trouble tangibly setting them into motion. I fear being perceived as incompetent by others.”\n\n\nI guess this means we have trouble executing what our Fi says, and we want others to recognize us when we do execute it.\n\n
2	Manifests unconsciously in blunt speech that may offend people. Also, inherent distrust of ‘the system’, corporations, red-tape, suits, the way things are run. Will seek help/assistance on technological issues and easily rages when it ‘doesn’t do what its supposed to do.’
1	It makes thinking a very painful, random process in many cases, at least for me.
1	I just wrote about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/99e5jc/what_is_your_type_and_how_do_you_experience_your/e4o52kp/)  I'm an INFP so you at least have SE, the NE probably accounts for the more ADHD type behavior.
1	What’s te 
1	My ISFP friend loves doing brain training puzzles and testing her IQ 
1	Being really good at arguments 12 hours after the argument is over while you're in bed
13	How do you differ from an INFP?	I am still finding out my real type, but someone here in Reddit told me that I am most likely an IxFP (instead of an INTP which I thought I am). \n\nSo yeah, here I am looking for inputs from others I guess. Maybe a person who really identifies with the ISFP personality can explain what sets his/her type apart from an intuitive? How did you know for sure you aren't an INFP?
19	When you're an ISFP and you interact with INFPs, you realize you aren't speaking the same language at all. At times  You feel somewhat "distanced" from them, even if they're your good friends. Their humor, their questionings, their way of thinking is different from yours. I've felt I could've been an INFP, but their Ne is something I don't quite get. I'll give you an example. When I'm with INFPs, I find that they often talk about things I wouldn't even consider. They can get philosophical for hours, while I can only be philosophical with things that I would apply to my life. Not that I have intellectual laziness, but I don't think there's an use in pondering whether desire is a sign of human imperfection or not.\n\nThey're more off in their own fantasy world than I am in mine, and our inner worlds are different too. They are more likely to come up with new suggestions, original species, things that couldn't work in real life, whereas I'm very "concrete" in my mind. If I have to make something up, it has to have a root somewhere in reality. I'm not much of a daydreamer, I can't spend hours fantasizing like they can. My daydreams have a root in reality, again. I don't think much about utopia-like scenarios, if that makes sense.\n\nI put a big emphasis on staying in touch with the real world because the thing of losing myself in fantasy scares me (and I've had delusions several times in my life). I have to feel things physically. I don't like reading because it helps me "escape". I like it because I can imagine things the way I want to, I can feel the paper on my fingers, and I can smell the book. I do have escapist tendencies once in a while, who doesn't? I smoke cigarettes. But not because they give me an escape from reality. It's because of the gesture, the way it feels, the very "action" of smoking. Also because I can sit down and focus on the moment.
10	If i didnt have such an *intensely* INFP sister i would think im infp because i always test out as infp. We are similar in loads of ways but we are super different in functions. By comparing the two of us i kinda know for sure that im isfp over infp so heres kinda how i know. Its an essay, im sorry.\n\nMy sister and her classically infp-ishness: \n\nShe really does have that imaginary world in her head. She writes comics and always has since she could pick up a pen. Her characters seem really alive and they live in a detailed place inside her mind. Then theres the morals. THE MORALS. she has always been really driven by her morals. I consider myself really moral driven as well but with her its way more deeply ingrained. Idk how to explain it. She is a great writer and musician and artist. She is deeply deeply empathetic. She is hypersensitive and diagnosed with bipolar. She uses Ne. The Ne is strong. Idk how to explain it but i can see it. The way her mind jumps from thing to thing is different from how mine does. Its really just a different way that she thinks. She says stuff that my mind would never come to think of. Its not to say that her mind is better or smarter because i in turn say things that her mind would never come to think of. We're just different. Shes just more outlandish. More "out there".\n\nNow theres me! Ive also got a deep creative streak. Ive been making stuff since i was a kid, ive always had a knack for drawing it and picked it up fast. I also write music and sing. I too can get "deep" and "philosophical" in my art but its different from the ways that my sister does. The meanings in my music tend to bubble up from the inside from the subconscious which i think is Ni. I write in a sensory way by which i mean i form lyrics based on the physical *sounds* of the words and the meaning get put together later. Se drives my art making where Ne drives my sisters art making. I keep saying it's hard to explain.  But it is. I can see the differences tho.\n\nIve always been more down to earth. I can see things more realistically. growing up i was more socially capable because i was more grounded in the world. The Se allowed me to be aware of social nuances in the moment so i could use that and act "normal" easier. My sister was completely inept at this. \n\nI could go on but ill spare you from that.\n\nSo yeah! I also highly recommend you take a functions test! Those are pretty helpful. But by comparing myself with my sister i started seeing where the differences were and our functions stacks stuck out to me.\n\nAlso i just didnt identify with the infp descriptions completely. I didnt identify with the isfp descriptions either because they all suck ass. \n\n
3	Both creative, but one is ideas, metaphors; the other is sensuality, texture, aesthetic. Some bridge the gap well, I think, like David Lynch - who I guess is an INFP, but has a strong aesthetic (but still, I feel it serves the idea, or the fantasy/creation/nostalgia). ^^^Bjork ^^^is ^^^another ^^^tricky ^^^one, ^^^I ^^^think.  \n  \nWhereas, someone like Lana Del Rey, ^^^who ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^know ^^^much ^^^about I think of as being lead by the vibe, the lushness. About creating, luxuriating in the moment, in the texture of the creative moment.
13	What's the best way to deal with ENTPs, as an ISFP?	More specifically, the aggressive "fuck you haha xd" types who say random shit just to start shit. \n\nI can't recall ever having seen one irl, but even in games I play ENTPs who are like this piss me off more than anything else.\n\nHow are you supposed to deal with them? Out-Ne them? Ignore them? Roast them?
33	Honestly if you roast them, they might actually appreciate it. But they will come back with even more toasty roasts aimed at you. It's a game. 
23	ENTP elder here.\n\nLet's be specific here. "Trolling" has a motivation - the motivation of a troll is to incite; "just to start shit", as you've said.\n\nENTPs aren't any more prone to that behavior than other types - they can be *good* at it, if it's something they've chosen to do - but it's an antisocial kind of thing, and being extroverted feelers, ENTPs would actually be *less* likely to choose to do it. ENTPs want people to like them and feel bad when people don't (even though they won't admit it).\n\nSo, why do ENTPs have a reputation for arguing for just the sake of it then? Because that *is* something we do, but it's a totally separate behavior from trolling. To someone that doesn't enjoy arguing, it may not *feel* very different, but the motivations are totally different. A troll starts a fight because they enjoy making you angry; what ENTPs do isn't motivated by the desire to upset people, it's a form of play - they enjoy the argument itself, and don't *want* you to get angry about it, they want you to play with them.\n\nYoung or immature ENTPs that haven't developed their Fe yet don't always understand why people respond to their mischief with anger. They will start fights and damage relationships by accident - it will often end with them being hurt that someone didn't just play along, and they'll get resentful of other people for being "too sensitive". But it's not malice, it's just social ineptitude. Trolls on the other hand, it's *all* malice. They're doing it strictly to sow discord.\n\nThe problem is, since we can't see people's motivations, they can look very similar from the outside. But the way to effectively deal with one is totally different than the way to deal with the other. For a troll, the best way to thwart their efforts is to ignore them. It's all about attention and reactions and if they're not getting them they'll go somewhere else. With an ENTP's banter, though, ignoring it can give them the perception that you're okay with it, which will encourage them to do it more in the future.\n\nThe best way to discern where they're coming from is with genuineness. If you're not in the mood for it, say something like "I know you're kidding, but that hurt my feelings"; "I know you're just fucking with me, but it's getting on my nerves and making me not want to play with you anymore". A troll is going to get a thrill from that, but if they start saying things like "butthurt" or "fee fees" you know for sure they're a troll and you can block/kick/ignore them with no qualms. An ENTP just being an ENTP, on the other hand, is going to be more likely to back off after something like that, and maybe even apologize.
18	Hello fellas, random ENTP here. I can confirm that ignoring the troll is the best response. Fighting back usually ends up in you getting legitimately upset over something that the troll didn't even truly mean. As for why ENTP's like to push people's buttons, it depends on the situation. If you're online or in a video game, it's probably just to fuck with you/for the lols etc...if it's excessively mean sprited it's usually from someone lacking maturity so just ignore it, block them or whatever. But sometimes if the trolling is coming from someone you consider a friend or at least a friendly acquaintance, it's because we are genuinely curious about how you'll react or we are a trying to get you to understand something. And sometimes this is how we show love. I joke that I'm only "nice" to people that I don't care about. And as to the whole "ENTPs can't see perspectives other than their own", that's complete hogwash. This is what we excel at, and where our infamous indecisiveness is derived from. BUT a major exception to this is when it comes to people's feeeeeeelings. We tend to think logically  (this therefore this and so forth) and often fail to take into account the fee fees when we are trying to drive a point home. But this doesn't mean we don't care or can't admit when we're wrong. I guess this stereotype comes from our biggest fear, which is being made to feel that we're stupid. Immature ENTPs may not admit when they're wrong just to avoid the embarrassment of feeling dumb. I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's a mistake to fight fire with fire in this case. You'll just end up mad and it's exactly what pointless trolling seeks to accomplish. But don't view ENTPs as aimless trolls because you got frustrated by some idiot online. End ramble.
8	What others call "trolling", we call challenging their perceptions.  A lot of people are afraid to get outside their comfort zone and think about things in any way differing from the norm.  ENTPs can't help but challenge that.  We're also sarcastic a-holes to boot, so if you can't stand that sort of behavior, you're pretty much just going to have to avoid ENTPs all together.  It's kind-of our nature to be provocative, inquisitory, and over-the-top.
14	Just tell them they are boring 
9	They thrive on attention in my experience, so ignoring them hurts a lot
3	ENTP trolling cN be grouped in a few catergories.\n\nImmaturity, curoisity, and mosy likely...boredom. Best bet is to ignore the troll portion of the convo and push on. If they wont drop it, drop the convo completely.
5	I usually pull out a knife and the conversation usually stops
2	avoid
2	They not entps. Usually it’s the isfps who constantly whine to us about how they don’t approve of our hair or clothes, 24/7.
3	Fire back at them and make them respect you. Then you'll be on equal footing in their heads. Then become emotionally exhausted by your actions and disengage!!!!!! Hahaha my ex was an ENTP and the way we communicated was so difficult to be on the same wavelength.
1	fuck you haha xd
1	Entps are annoying to me mostly because they cant see outside themselves in a certain type of way.. I avoid them. Some are cool tho.\n\nEdit: i will rephrase it closer to the way i actually see it. Its less that entps annoy me  its just that it seems we're never gonna be on the same page.
1	You don't, you debate them and get them to open up, throw in these types who are more fitted to fulfil the job of exterminating or extracting their attention. INTP, INTJ, INFJ, they'll know what to do. You can't outNe who's an NeDom as ISFP are tertiary. After these said types engage, leave them be to their private business and affairs. That would probably lead to talks about world destruction. You have the power to make these conditions happen, OP! Do it. Great power comes great responsibility. :) - INFJ

3	ISFPs: What is your relationship like with your father?	Pretty self-explanatory and curious to know if it differs between redditors :)
3	Didn't grow up with one. Never felt his absence either. Which is weird.\n\nAnd I don't know if this is related, but I'm also a turbulent ISFP (based on the Big 5 personality test).
3	He was a single parent for me and my brother and is still a great guy. He has issues just like everybody else, and was always super real and honest and understanding. 
3	He's not very talkative, but he does lots of things for the family and sacrifices himself. I admire him.
2	The teens were pretty rough but we're best friends now 
2	Not great. He was kind of an asshole in my teens so at the time I withdrew from my relationship with him. On a number of occassions he really hurt my feelings, and I absolutely did not want to put myself in a vulnerable position with him again. We lived together and shared about five words in two years. Perhaps it was immature of me, but I was a teenager. He was a grown man. \n\nI'm an adult now. Neither of us have made an effort to repair the relationship. I barely see him, and when I do it's terribly awkward. He feels like a stranger.
1	Pretty great. He's an ISTP btw.
1	It feels like we are both from different worlds. It's funny, we get along really great when it's just me and him. But when were with other people, we piss each other off. I think we both have a desire to control the mood or atmosphere of the room, and when he takes it in the wrong direction it pisses me off like nothing else can.
1	Ehhhhh... not that good. Long story short, he's a pathological liar like everyone in his family, and he always finds a way to be the victim in all situations. (For his type, he's an ESFJ.)
1	Dating advice	What would you lot advice an INTP who wants to date an ISFP?
4	Be really really really patient
2	Be clear and direct. But respectful.
1	Make or do something together hands on, take the lead but give them options.
8	Anyone else got mistyped as INTP before?	Just me?
4	That's interesting because the INTP is said to be the ISFP's superego.
4	I started out convinced I was INTJ- same cognitive functions, different order. My current theory is that, in order to deal with some trauma at the time, I’d been suppressing my SE(trying to ignore what the patterns in my life were telling me) and FI(ignoring my feelings and trying to convince myself to just be “logical”).\n\nI think it’s easy to mistype as a Rational in particular; it can be where you end up if you’re trying really hard to give the “right” answers. Hope that helps your question?
2	I’ve been mistyped as INTJ and ESTP.\n\nBut those people had no clue about MBTI.
1	I mistyped as ISTP before. 
1	xNFP, but thought I was INTP for years. I have fairly well developed Ti, possibly because logic was valued more highly than emotion in my family of origin. This guy has an interesting take on it.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fbV3wiwKLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fbV3wiwKLE)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzBSetMXkTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzBSetMXkTA)
1	Yeah i did the long max thing and [got intp](https://personalitymax.com/report/?pt=11-32-58-42&mi=53-33-47-53-67-33-47-77&ls=33-38-51&bh=47). don't really relate.  \n   \nAnyone rec a test that isn't shit?  \n  \nedit: actually i liked one of the survey ones i did on here (a sex one, i think), but it didn't give personlised results. oy vey
1	Yup. Mistyped as ISTP, INTP, and INFJ.
1	I was constantly tested as an INTP, but now I am realizing that I am actually an Fi-dom. Just have to know if I am an ISFP or an INFP.
0	[deleted]
3	What are some sure signs that someone is ISFP and not ESFP? Vice versa?	
6	Miley Cyrus (ESFP) vs Britney Spears (ISFP).\n\nNuff said.
6	ISFPs shy away from parties and large gatherings and from hosting events. ESFPs love that shit.
4	As an ISFP I tend to have a smaller group of friends and although I like social gatherings, I lose interest in talking pretty quickly
12	In what (major) ways do you differ from the ISFP stereotype, or average ISFP?	For me:\n\n1. I'm not really that laidback and optimistic. Sure, I have my moments, but I definitely don't have that hippie attitude lots of other ISFPs seem to have. \n\n2. I'm rather lazy and stay indoors often. More of a sensor thing in general, but it seems that most sensors go outside much more. \n\n3. While I do enjoy drawing like many other ISFPs seem to do, I only do it like 5 times a year. I want to improve but I can't stay motivated for a long time. \n\n4. I'm not really much of an explorer, I prefer walking on paths that were meant for walking instead of walking off-road, following instructions instead of trying things out, etc. Interestingly though, my INTJ cousin is a big explorer.
12	I feel like ISFPs are either chronic outdoors folks or chronic cough potatoes, though. The ISFP in me thrives on lazy and it’s definitely not uncommon. \n\nEDIT: cough potatoes = fun but wrong 
8	I'm not "creative" or an "artist". Although I do still enjoy things that are aesthetically pleasing. 
5	i feel i don’t enjoy art as much as most ISFPs would. however, i’m very much about music. 
4	For me its that im super lazy and barely do anything. I have tons of half finished diys and i feel like i was cheated in a day if i don't get enough "do nothing" time. Im a big homebody and dont like doing sports and outdoor stuff that much. In tons of other ways im a stereotypical isfp tho. 
3	I’m artsy but I don’t necessarily identify as an artist. 
2	For me I'm not so liberal and I deeply think the world and society needs order to function properly.
2	I'm an explorer, but not a thrill seeker at all.
18	Anyone else is pretty quiet and reserved but really loud and obnoxious when alone/drunk?	I'm usually quiet and keep my thoughts to myself but christ do I become an obnoxious cunt when I have one too many drinks, almost as if I was a whole different person. Anyone else is like this?
7	isn’t it like that with most people tho? 
7	Yeeeeep. It only takes two drinks for me to go from quiet and reserved to talkative and bubbly. But the more I drink the louder I get. Sometimes it’s hard to keep myself in check. 
1	Me!
1	Not really loud, but I either turn into a weeping mess or a raging beast when drunk.
7	Please help a very confused ESFJ (:	Hi everyone! I’ve done a lot of reading and there seems to be conflicting opinions about ISFP and ESFJ unions. I think ISFPs are adorable and fascinating but also really confusing so if you could spare some perspective, I could really use some backup (:\n\nI (24F) have been seeing an ISFP (29M) for four months and it was great to begin with. His Fi fascinates me, the way he is absolutely sure of himself and won’t compromise who he is in anyway. I like how his eyes are so expressive and that he sees beauty in things I would never consider and it reminds me to stop and smell the flowers in my no nonsense practical approach to everything. \n\nHe was extremely persistent to begin with and after I agreed to go on a date with him, we got on like fire. He was mentioning things like if I wanted children and marriage and even hinted at moving in together when I almost bought a house. He made sure early on that I was open to a relationship. I thought it was intense but I figured that’s just who he is and accepted it - I was never sure if he was joking or not. All of a sudden, he became distant for three weeks and nothing was defined beyond the fact that we were exclusive - to which there was no conversation, just that he expected me to not see anyone else because he wasn’t. \n\nI knew that ISFPs need space to ruminate and formulate their thoughts so I waited, even though it was excruciating. Eventually he came back but would pull away, especially when I showed affection. He eventually expressed he feels lost in his life, especially in his career and that it is reflected in his interactions with me even though he wanted to be with me. It became a problem when he mentioned that I could talk to (but not see) other guys if I wanted. I was confused and seeing he hurt my feelings, he then expressed he is not good at explaining his thoughts and he wishes he never said it - inferring from other threads, this is something ISFPs struggle with. \n\nI initially wanted to distance myself in fear of getting hurt and at the advice of my friends of him ‘stringing me along,’ and called him to voice my opinions early so he could have time to then think and get back to me. However in my vulnerability, I broke up with him thinking he needed his freedom and I couldn’t possibly wait indefinitely. \n\nI have since realised that I needed to break free of my Fe of letting other people’s opinions of me inhibit my decisions. I need to go after what I want because it is a real connection I feel and I would regret if I didn’t at least try. I am worried that I jumped the gun with the break up and that I have ruined my chance. \n\nI have presented to him my perspective that nobody is perfect and that relationships are a safe place to be who you are, insecurities and flaws laid bare for mutual growth. I’m not sure if I’m being selfish but I care about him and want to help.\n\nIn the end, I don’t want to push him and force him into something he doesn’t want but am I being unreasonable? I know Fi values doing everything at their own pace and hope I’m not being ignorantly self righteous by playing saviour. \n\nDo ISFP/ESFJ relationships never end well? Is there something I can do about the Fi/Fe clash? I had a five year relationship with an INFP so I already have an idea of what it could be like. But I was young and stupid then and have tried to learn from that relationship because it was very fulfilling otherwise. I have been determined to grow from it to be a better person because let’s face it, I was probably that stereotypical ESFJ that everyone hates.\n\nWill he resent me for trying help and see it as an impingement on his freedom for self discovery? What can I do? I am giving him space to make his decision now but it’s eating me up inside.\n\nTL;DR    ISFP is hot and cold, I broke up with him out of fear but have since tried to reconcile by trying to work it out. I am trying to be understanding and respect his space but am worried I stuffed up big time. Help!
3	Yes, if I was in that situation, like other ISFPs, I may need space to ruminate and figure things out about my career, but not necessarily the space that others try to give me (as that may not be the right kind of space), but more the space that I feel I need at any moment. And I may not get why you would be confused by that. And the pressure to want to make you not confused can be a factor that reduces the space I may need. \n\nAlso I would not like anything that felt like betrayal, but could accept genuine reconciliation. 
16	DAE get paranoid that theyre a narcissist?	Sometimes i worry that im a narcissist. Sometimes i cant tell if i feel inferior to people or if i feel superior to people.  Like if im a narcissist then I have a grandiose self image. since  being a narcissist is a bad trait being one would threaten my grandiose image so of course id be paranoid that im a narcissist. Anyone scared they might be a narcissist?
8	Yes, sometimes. Where most people have the problem that they compare themselves to other people too much, I have the opposite problem - I don't even know how to compare myself to other people. To me each person is a unique and separate individual with their own thoughts and feelings. I usually compare myself to the 'big picture' I have in my head, with other people included. I don't know if that makes me narcissistic though. But I've done ~~narcissist-like~~ things that could be seen as narcissistic too and worry about them now and again.
5	I do too. At times I think I might be a covert narcissist. I have been with people who made me doubt my perceptions a lot too. This might be more of a mental issue than an ISFP thing, but when I'm in a "burning" ("hyped", "reckless", if you get what I mean, I don't know exactly how to say it) phase, I tend to be insanely overconfident, I have delusions of grandeur (like, I'm going to start a new trend, I'm going to be the best at x thing, I'm loved by x person, I am limitless), I'm very impulsive, "end justifies the means" mindset, and determined to get what I want the point of ruthlessness. But it's likely that if you are worried you are a narcissist, you actually aren't one, because narcissists usually don't think about things like that. Again, I might be wrong about it. Have you tried to talk to a professional? 
3	Definitely have gotten this feeling before. Especially when I'm with someone who is very complimentary, or when I'm receiving a lot of praise. Sometimes I feel like I like it a little *too* much and it freaks me out because being a narcissist is the last thing I want.
1	[This table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder#Akhtar's_profile) on the schizoid personality wiki page has my number . .   \n  \n^^yeesh  \n \n*feeling inferior and an outsider in life | hidden grandiosity*  \n 
1	I am better then other people. I'm the only one who could make the right choice when the day comes
11	Do you find yourself making up things a lot so you have something to talk about?	
15	no
4	It has happened at some point, though I wasn't really making things up. I was mainly talking about minor details, such as the colour of the sky, or something like that. It was usually when I wanted to communicate with the person, yet they would dismiss any topic I'd try to bring up.
1	if i dont have something to talk about i usually dont talk :/ 
1	I used to do that more when i was younger but ive kinda stopped. Im just comfortable with the fact that im boring now xD
1	no
21	just me or do you think small talk is unnecessary and a little lackluster?	more-so since i think the other person wouldnt find it engaging. it’s also just difficult coming up with a response without sounding insincere or not into the topic at all but i’d like to hear your opinion
7	i agree. i feel there’s always something more interesting to talk about that’s more engaging. 
6	I feel small talk is necessary to build initial rapport with someone but yea i mean i do feel kinda pressured to act overly engaged during small talk so i dont like it because of that.
5	Yes I agree. I really hate small talk and I’m also terrible at it. It’s so cringey when people talk about the obvious weather outside or the traffic lol. I always prefer to have more meaningful conversations and get to know others on a deeper level or not talk at all lol 
1	I agree. I can't start small talk without feeling I'm being phony. And I hate to waste my time.
1	Super old thread but I just skip it. I can't stand it, it's awkward, and unnecessary.
30	Do you find people reject you after learning more about you?	It's almost like I give off a different first impression to new people. They seem to think I am more popular and light than I actually am. Once they learn that I'm more serious, moody, and not a fucking socialite - they bounce. \n\nAre your first impressions usually off? It's pretty annoying because I'm attracting the wrong people and not meeting anyone similar to me.
7	I haven’t had that issue, in a very chill person in general. Through high school I was known but not popular and mostly stuck to a core group of friends. I graduated almost 10 years ago and I’m still friends with a few of them, one is still my best friend and was even my best man at my wedding.
6	Yes, people often get very wrong first impressions of me, and I noticed that some people just can’t let go of those impressions and they get confused when I act in a way that is not in the little box they made to try and put me in. Maybe they see me as undermining their system they use to understand people and too much work to deal with. So as I meet new people I try to emphasize early that it is not easy to understand me.
1	Not sure. In my current school (well, I sort of already graduated but I'll call it my current school) the first friend I got kinda turned on me after a while, ignoring me and acting like a douche if he has to interact with me. I'm certain it's the fault of someone else, though, since some guy who didn't like me from day one started hanging out with him shortly before this happened. They're still big friends.\n\nI do find that in general people are a little more iffy about me after I talk a lot about my views, since some can be a bit controversial. But I guess they usually just forget it after a while since it never turns south.
1	I do find this to be true, strangely... but at the same time, it can be the catalyst for unexpected friendships, when certain people prefer our more serious and emotional interiors over the "socialite" exterior we for some reason tend to have around new people.\n\nI've tried to be more relaxed and myself when meeting people, and it really does make a difference because it turns off the wrong people (who would've been turned off anyway once you stop acting popular and fake or whatnot) and gets more like-minded people in your circle.
8	Is anybody else the obnoxious friend that has to point out every cool cloud/tree/animal/etc?	
7	Sure, but I dont classify it as obnoxious. 
3	Look! Cows!\n\nRepeat.
2	You found me! One time my friend was like "you should really get a dog", after I pointed out a dog for like the fourth time. 
1	Yeaaaah thats me. 
2	What's something you're excited for?	It can be anything like life goals coming to fruition or a new video game coming out. What's the thing you've been daydreaming about being in your life?
4	I'm excited for facing my problems like they are simple problems and not death sentences! I feel like I am in that mindset now!
3	Im excited to move in with my boyfriend in February. Im looking forward to everything. Choosing a place, decorating it, having coffee together on a rainy day in it, even cleaning it and all the boring things. Yeah im nervous too because ive never lived with a partner before. But i think we'll work well together and i really cant wait to finally be living with him! Im really looking forward to it.
3	The day I finally move out of my parent's house! And the Logan Paul vs KSI match on August 25th!
2	Buying a new car in a few days! 
7	Hey, what’s up fuckers!?!	How y’all fucks doing.\n\nFun fact: That’s the first time I used the word “Y’all”
12	Sup bro i'm buying a new car yee \n\nsup with u
5	I just lost a train at the last second heh. I ran for nothing. 
5	I use yall on a daily basis, Oof.
3	Thinking about how to make money
3	aye
3	Sup mate
3	Just got home for work now im eating chocolate ;D
8	What is your favorite MBTI type other than our own?	Like the title says, as an isfp, what is your favorite mbti type?\n\n\nMy husband is an ENFP, and i think we go really well with each other (..most of the time). I like ENFPs positive outgoing personality and being very open and understanding while knowing how to be goofy and fun.\n\nBut in general, i enjoy the company of extroverts more than introverted types. I like bouncing my thoughts off of them since ISFPs arent natural conversation starters. Bc usually if im with other introverts, as an extroverted introvert, i usually end up steering the conversations which gets pretty exhausting and boring after awhile. 
10	Infps :) I love Infps. 
4	Enfj and infj, the most genuine people I’ve ever met 
5	ISTPs, INFJs, and INTJs. I get along better with other introverts. My extroverted friends are sometimes a bit too much for me.
3	Anyone in their mentally healthy state. All types can be hard to deal with when they’re in the grip of their inferior function. But that said, I like INTPs, ISTPs, ENFPs, ISFJs, ESFJs, INFJs generally speaking.
2	ESFP
2	ISTPs, INTJs, ISTJs, ISFJs, INFPs, ENFPs, ESFPs (in small doses)
1	Tbh i get along best with other isfps. But my fave other types are probably, isfj, infp, enfp, esfp, istp, and infj.
15	Does anyone else internally feel younger than people your own age?	I know i keep posting a lot here but i was just looking at the instagrams of people i graduated highschool with (2012). They seem so... Grown up. I know we're all 24 or 25 but like.. I feel about 5 years younger than they seem to me. \n\nI feel the same as i did when i was 20 pretty much. I dont know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. \n\nI went on a night walk with a friend just chatting recently and we passed through down town, stopping in to use the restroom at a bar. Everyone seemed so much older than me even though a lot of them were probably my age or younger. I guess its cus i dont really go out drinking so the bar scene is fairly foreign for me. But ive never felt more out of place and separated from them.  Im not immature (i think?) its not like i havent changed or grown since i was 19 or 20... Ive done the partying and the sleeping around and those things no longer interest me. So ive moved on in many ways. But still i just dont feel im on the level of other people my age.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like theyre a lot younger than their age?
7	Yep! I’m turning 20 soon and i still feel like i’m 15 or something.. i really want to grow up yet
4	Yes. I can tell I'm more mature but life stage stuff I'm nowhere near my friends. I dont want kids or a husband yet.. everyone had one or the other by now (I'm 25)
3	Yes, and lots of others think I’m a lot younger than I am to.
1	I feel older tbh.
1	I used to feel older than other kids my age up until... 14? Now I just feel right at home ^^at ^^^16. Wonder if that will change as I move onto my 20s.
1	100% ... I'm 43 and most people are surprised at my age when they find out. 
17	Anyone else bad at remembering stuff from books or tv or movies?	Idk i just have a terrible memory with stuff like this. I mean i watch films and i remember how i felt about them and i comprehend them at the time but often i end up forgetting the plot and the names of the characters and other details after a while. When someone asks "have you seen ___?" im usually like "yeah, but i dont remember anything about it". Im also horrrrrible at catching references. Like, even if ive seen the movie a few times i still wont catch a reference someone makes about it. Like, lines of dialogue in films never stick with me. I have a good memory for things in real life and stuff. I barely ever forget someones name and things like that. But for some reason if its a show or something i just forget everything about it. Is this an isfp thing or am i just slow? Haha
3	Same! And there are some people who always feel the need to make a movie or TV reference whenever they speak about anything at all. These people are incredibly frustrating to communicate with. Especially when I tell them I haven’t seen it, and they proceed to spend 10 minutes telling me the entire plot in detail, totally derailing the original conversation. 
3	Yes! I have a hard time remembering things like that vividly, even after I've just watched/read them. I can only remember certain parts that happen thorughout, far from everything
2	Especially books. I always remember that it was a really good book but when someone asks what is it about I don't know what to say :')
1	Same!! I think it’a an ISFP thing 🤔
1	Yup!
1	I have seen  a lot of movies, i remember the plot of most films, a few scenes are remembered and are used to describe the film, the rest are forgotten.
1	I think I'm an ISFP and I have trouble, too. Once I see something again, I'll usually remember what happened, but not the first time usually. Especially something like GoT, I have to watch the recaps to remember anything that happened
1	I'm like that too. 
1	I could have written this post, it's so spot on. I wonder if it correlates with any cognitive functions.
13	DAE find it totally impossible to guess how other people view you?	I've always had a very clear view of myself. For the past while though I was very anxious around people, constantly worried about how they thought of me. I eventually got (mostly) out of that mindset, but came to the realisation that I have no clue at all how people actually think of me, and most of my anxious years were because I would assume the worst when I didn't know. Is this an ISFP thing? It would kind of make sense, because Fe is nowhere in our stack, but then you would think it would be a very common thing to happen, since 8 out of 16 types don't have it either. Unless it actually is just a very common thing, haha.
5	Interesting. An ISFP friend of mine was telling me the other day about this very phenomenon. I am inclined to pin the blame on inferior Te. There's an oft-neglected parallel between Fe and Te. Te can actually be other-oriented in the same way. What is the nature of your anxiety? What sort of questions are you asking yourself. I'm just spitballing, but I could see inferior Te causing someone to wonder how other people are evaluating them role-wise. As in... **I know who I am, but do I really fit in as a cog of the collective machinery?** \n\n   \nAs a (possible?) ENTP, I don't relate at all to your idea of having a clear view of myself. At least, I've had to think very hard to come to a place where I feel I have a good vantage point of what, exactly, I'm all about. And with my tertiary Fe, I struggle even to grok what people feel about me, beyond a low-resolution, childish way. \n\n  \nKind of fascinating how all of the functions interact, eh? :) 
4	Opposing Fe!
3	woah this is me. anytime someone asks me a cheesy question like, "what are three words your friends would use to describe you" i literally can't give them one. like do i appear shy to them? friendly? mysterious? i have no idea. 
1	I think it has to do with your inferior Te that’s insecure of the possibility of people thinking of you in a negative light. I think it’s best to let go of that insecurity and realize your strengths. You’re gonna be okay and I think your strength is helping people overcome thoughts that would ruin their own mood by getting them into a activity in the real world. 
1	Yep, I have that too! I’ve been told I’ve been using Fe instead Fi. 
1	Yup. I don't know what people actually think of me. I prefer not to think about it, actually. I find that I care and I don't care about it at the same time, it's weird. 
1	Question about ESFJs.	How do ISFPs feel about ESFJs? What’s your experience been like? Would you mind sharing your thoughts? Thank you :)
3	I have a friend thats an ESFJ.If I walk somewhere,she'll usually follows me.She's very optimistic and laughs at my usually lame jokes.Though,she likes to gossip about my other friend(that is a possible INTJ).All in all,shes a good friend.
3	They're great in my opinion. Granted my sister is one and she's one of my best friends, and I also have 3 other EXFJ s close to me so I may be biased lol. But ESFJs are amazing. They're attentive, considerate of you and your needs, warm, keep the mood up, socially intelligent, supportive, etc. They make you feel important. They're one of the best friends you could have, and they're very good at offering practical advice to boot. One of the most underrated types in my opinion. I feel so lucky to have them in my life.
3	Haven't got a good experience with ESFJs. I usually am attracted to them a LOT at first, but then can less and less stand them. I've known two who were absolute trash tier. My dad (ESFJ 3w2), and an ex-friend (ESFJ 2w3). Both of them seem to be on the unhealthy end of the spectrum. I find that when I'm really deep into depression, I can fall into that ESFJ shadow and I grow to act just like them, though it's not my true self.\n\nMy dad doesn't know how to think for himself, though he's nowhere near a bad guy. He's a pathological liar as well, so I can't really trust him. Everytime he's with a new woman, he morphs into a version of himself to please her, and he can totally give up hobbies or tastes he used to have when he was alone, just so he can be "perfect" for her. He has control issues as well, and that's part of why I can't stand him anymore. He's waaaay over-the-top sweet with me and that gets on my nerves too. He will do anything to please people and preserve outer appearances, and there's nothing authentic in his demeanor.\n\nMy ex-friend was probably a narcissist. She's the type of person to be very friendly and warm at first, have a lot of "friends", who, I think, are more likely to be good acquaintances rather than anything, and be somewhat cheesy in her tastes. Much like my dad. She morphed into a perfect version too. We had a lot in common, until I found, day after day, that actually we were pretty opposite. When we hit the 3-month mark of being friends, she started being increasingly weirder, started being snarky and critical of everything I did, and her control issues (as well!) showed up. If things didn't go her way, she'd get either on the verge of a breakdown or she would get angry and take it out on me. She ended up screaming at me for a stupid reason, degraded and insulted me, until she discarded me when I called her out on her bullshit. I don't know what's become of her, and I don't care anymore. I stopped caring when she told me a very degrading thing a while before our fight.
2	From my experiences with them Im not a huge fan but im sure there are many great ones out there!
6	Are isfp good with language?	Im bilingual and currently learning a third language. I feel like i am particularly good at learning a language. Just curious if that’s an isfp thing.\n\n\nSide thought - in general i am not good at conveying my thoughts into words (typical isfp thing), so it carries into my sub languages as well. For instance, i may know and understand perfectly in my head in the language, but it may seem like i dont know the language as well as i do because i dont speak it out.\n\n\nBut anyways, are my fellow isfps good at language?\n\nAlso, do you find this trait attractive in others? Like if they are multilingual 
4	I learned English thanks to the internet, watching english videos on youtube, vose films and reading here on reddit was enough to have a decent level, speaking i'm a mess tho.
2	I learned my native language very early (age 3 -ish) plus Russian. I knew English and some Japanese (through internet and anime) by age 13 and started helping with some translations in my teen years. I don't know how much it is because of young age, but yeah, I think I do learn languages very easily. I think our Se especially can assist us in gathering new objective information and assimilating it very quickly. Don't know about memory or retaining information, that might be more difficult for us (lol)
2	I feel the same way as you. English is my fourth language and I had an easier time picking it up compared to my brother (when we moved to NA). I was also able to erase my accent much quicker than him. 
2	Yes. I think with isfp functional Setup is a great one for learning new languages. I think it activates and almost hits all the regions of the brain for the isfp to use a new language and use it too. 
2	I learnt English by myself, and I've always had a great level in my native language. I just love those things. I learn bits of languages here and there, ~~often profanity~~, but I'd like to learn more languages, so I can express myself in plenty of ways.
2	I don't find it attractive but intimidating because I have not yet mastered a second language.
2	I'm pretty good at learning languages, if you factor out my difficulty in committing to regular practice. I have a much harder time with written language than spoken though. I can be trying and trying to remember the conjugation for a word and then immediately know it upon speaking the sentence out loud in French, for example. And with Chinese, which I've just started learning, I find the tones to be very easy so far, while the characters are just an absolute ball of confusion to me.
2	I’m bilingual and currently trying to learn a third language. Emphasis on trying; it’s harder prioritizing and practicing on a regular basis than the actual learning hahaha
1	I only know english
0	Hahaha I don't think mbti and being good at languages have any correlation, but it's always so appealing to learn a new language. 
3	ISFPs, could you please fill out my MBTI Romantic Relationship Survey?	[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nAnyone can take it.\n\nIf you know your and your current or ex partner's mbti, please fill out as many times as you've had partners!\n\nIt's simple and I would love to expand on it in the future but these are all the variables I need to complete my Multivariate Statistics Analysis class. I'll be posting the results. \n\nThank you!
4	Ha, I’d take it, but I’ve never been in a relationship. I’m forever alone! *dab dab*
3	Interesting how the majority of people are with intjs? Weren't they supposed to be a small fraction of the population?
3	INFJs are supposed to be the rarest type, and yet 22% of responses are from INFJs, making them by far the most common according to this survey. Either people are screwing with you, or people really want to think they're INFJs when they're not.
7	Estp dating an isfp feeling boxed in.	Im an estp male dating an isfp female  for the past two years and I love her a lot and I think isfps are the only type that make me feel something close to even feeling or feeling loved but I seem to have been feeling boxed overall in life and think im getting more restricted in my expansive ways of living .\n\nIsfps are my supervisor and the dynamics from what I've read seem to be too bad  for the estp.\n\nCan you guys help me to overcome this idealization I have for her ?  
9	Can you elaborate on why you feel restricted?
2	My best friend is an ESTP. He has a lot of new crazy ideas all the time and I'm the one who keeps him grounded. Sometimes if we stay in that dynamic too long it just turns out to be me shooting his ideas down left and right. Not sure if it's similar to your situation.\nA reminder that it's okay to venture out and try new things even if they *might* not work out ideally is useful. Fuck the comfort zone and all that.\n\nAbove all, let your partner know exactly what is giving you these feelings so you can work it out.
1	I think you’re idealizing her bc she’s well versed in Fi. I idealize the isfp supervisor, enfp, bc they are well versed in Ne— good at seeing patterns and predicting what will happen, meaning that they are comfortable with change and can see multiple options and consequences. As isfp my biggest fear is chaos, so that’s admirable to me. For your relationship, estps have weak Fi so they struggle with more internal conflicts relating to expressing themselves outwardly. You may feel that whenever you have troubling feelings or thoughts you may not know how to express them. Basically your biggest fear is her biggest strength. Realize that you can strengthen your weakness. \n\nHonestly though, your isfp likely admires you too. I remember an estp I was attracted to but thought I wasn’t compatible with. I was scared of all the things he was good at— being charming and good at dancing, taking care of his physical health and appearance, being fearless. You should talk with her about your concerns—don’t start by saying what’s bothering you (bc maybe it’s not your forte to talk about negative stuff), but start by being charming and playful and suggestive and open her up for convo. Or, if she’s good with criticism, just tell her how you feel. We like honesty and sincerity :)
10	DAE consider yourself a practical dreamer rather than a daydreamer?	I noticed I rarely, if ever, daydream. It usually happens when I have a crush on someone, and that doesn't happen all the time either, though when it happens, it happens hard. But I'm still a dreamer. Just, I dream "practically". If I dream of doing something, I will take action towards it. I can't spend hours daydreaming like some people I know. I have to think about something that actually will lead me to a concrete thing. Does anyone else do that? I'd not be surprised if it was typical of us ISFPs to be "practical dreamers" rather than "daydreamers". 
5	Hey :) I usually test as INFP but I feel convinced I am ISFP, so there's the possibility that this answer isn't representative...\n\nWhen I dream practically, I am considering what I want to do (usually in the moment or for a decision within three months) by envisioning the action that comes to me most naturally, without feelings of resistance. It helps me to envision going to the park, for example, before I can decide to do it.\n\nSometimes, like when I have a crush or am missing a significant other, and I am tired, I will daydream idly about some random situation where we are together. I am hoping that this situation plays out, but I won't take action toward it, and I can remind myself that what I am dreaming about isn't real and it's not a great idea to dwell on or trust these dreams.\n\nAnother situation I sort of daydream is when I am thinking about how others will feel about the actions I take (when I feel social pressure, I think ISFPs struggle with wanting to be loved and accepted or at least not hated). I will imagine someone else's face or a negative conversation if I am not careful. This is the most unintentional kind of daydreaming.
3	maybe i'm using the wrong term, but when i 'daydream', i zone-out completely. like trance.
2	I would agree to an extent. I'm not saying I always take action towards the thing but when I tend to daydream and think about things that could actually happen or effect my life. For instance, daydreaming about taking a vacation with my wife somewhere. I can spend a lot of time fantasizing but it's always like 'things that I think could happen'.\n\nThis is very different to most of my friends who are intuitives (Ne) who daydream and think indepth about stuff I consider 'useless' because it has no impact on their real life, and they have no way to implement any of it in a practical way.
2	Ohhhh, that makes sense. I often daydream, but it's rarely "what if" scenarios (if it is it's either when I have a crush or something alternate-history related). Usually it's about different ways to go about doing something, what I should do to solve x, hype for y that is about to happen, etc.
2	Yes, i get this. I day dream about crushes, i daydream about art projects i could/should do, finishing songs and starting a band, i daydream about saying certain things to people or saying something funny and everyone laughs (yes im quite lame). Sometimes I day dream about styles i could try out, like what if i pierced my nipples or bleached my hair. Stuff like that. Yeah its always about stuff that *could* happen in my life. On occasions ive gotten story ideas and have daydreamed about them. But thats fairly rare.
3	Hey can someone tell me how se manifests in esfps like I’m 5? Thanks	
22	A realization	Hi, I don't know if you all have struggled with something similar, but I wanted to share.\n\nSometimes I hide from the world because I fear that outside forces will corrupt my values. Things like media, some social norms, etc. I realized that instead of avoiding things that are inauthentic to me, I should focus on BEING more authentic myself.\nInstead of avoiding tasks I can't relate to, I should look at fortifying myself with activities which vitalize me. If I trust myself to live for my values, I will care less about doing the necessary minutiae. It's a form of self-respect. \n\nFeel free to offer a different opinion, I will be aware of any classic ISFP offense I take and calm down before responding :P :)
5	I enjoy seeing how some of the media ideologies contrast with my values. It gives me a sense independence while at the same I try my best to be aware that nobody's perfect and therefore we gotta respect each other's beliefs. \n\nAlso, the more I learn about the real world. The more I realize some of my values are very flawed and start to embrace change.
4	The way'd I put is that I know who I am and what I want and I hide from the world because it irritates me when it tries to tell me who I am or what I want. Also, being by yourself just gives you the freedom to do what you want lol.\n\nI would say I should try to be a little more community orientated and less self absorbed but that's a lie. I don't truly believe that. That said I was rather suppressed as a child and coerced into being self sacrificing so maybe I'm just making up for lost time.
3	Love this
3	I'm sort of the opposite (I think). I've always done my own thing, and now I'm trying to understand the regular path and discover the merit in it.  \n  \nbut i might have misunderstood. sometimes my brain struggles to parse the mbti lingo.
51	Are you bad at explaining?	(A DAE thing) One thing I've noticed that consistently comes up, is that I'm absolutely terrible at explaining things to others, nearly everything including the things I do and myself. It often leads to awkward situations as I stumble over my words. I feel like I have a head full of thoughts but I'm the worst at bringing them out. Are we ISFPs bad at explaining things? (Also, does this make you feel isolated at times?)
31	I’m an ISFP and the same. I can never articulate clearly what I feel and/or think in a moment. I can only really do it after I’ve had time to reflect on whatever point/feeling I’m trying to get across... and it’s usually too late by that point haha. 
15	I do. It doesn't make me feel isolated, but underestimated.\nThough it gives me advantages when I ace planned public speaking and such and i can take my revenge.
11	im great at explaining in writing. ive always aced english classes and even speeches and stuff. But when it comes to something like- for example, passing important info off about the details of a situation with a customer to another co worker i stumble, stutter, throw out useless details, say stuff in non chronological order etc. Any time pressure tends to make me a horrible communicator.
7	Yes! That’s why I write (and text, and message) more than I talk. In person I am pretty quiet - or at least - I don’t have too much to add to a conversation. 
4	I used to have heard time having enough courage to express my feelings, but I have always been okay in terms of putting it in words 
5	Kind of. The more I try to get my point across, the more I fuck up at it. It ends up in a garbled transmission, if that makes sense.
2	If I’m feeling confident I’m good with words. When I feel insecure, fuckkkk no. \n\nMy pet peeve is when somebody takes way too long to explain something. I feel like I automatically condense my thoughts so I don’t go on and on explaining something.
2	I’m better at articulating through writing. Otherwise it’s just word vomit or it sounds like I’m being very cavalier about whatever subject I’m talking about.
1	For me, I'll start explaining a thought that I have in my head, but I can't figure out how to say it. I've also heard, "Wow, you're a good story teller" too many times to count
1	I thought this was just me - it’s sooo embarrassing I feel like I sound stupid 😂
11	What are defining traits of ISFPs to YOU?	There is often talk about how ISFP stereotypes are sometimes true and sometimes not.\n\nWhat do you think makes up an ISFP? \n\nI appreciate life examples/anecdotes.
35	Very observant of body language, tone, levels of communication that are more emotionally subtle that others may not notice. Emotionally intense but quiet about it. Go with the flow  but also individualistic. Kinda zen. Non confrontational but not wimpy.
12	Sensitive, puts a lot of thought into everything, social media and physical looks are curated. I have a deep appreciation for ISFPs that I don't think I can communicate.\n\nEdit: Thought about this some more. I think my ISFP childhood best friend really sparked the creativity in me. We're activity relations and doing things with her really made me have fun with what was possible. Pretty priceless thing to give me.
9	Live and let live. Has own ideas/judgments about everything but doesn't want to impose them on others, unless through influence like art.  
9	For me... I have a sixth sense that tells me when people around me need to talk, help or have some problem going on.\n\nI'm quite aloof and carefree, spontaneous, outgoing, arts and crafts lover, animal lover and travel addict.\n\nI would say a defining trait is how difficult it can be to deal with our emotional stability, especially when things don't work well with the people we really care for. On the other hand, the willingness to sacrifice our own feelings for stability and less conflict, also defines who we are... although, I learned to not self-sacrifice myself to avoid conflict and would rather walk away.
8	Not super well-spoken unless we're in the zone or practice a lot. Fumbling over words, taking time to put a weird concept into concrete verbal communication. That's why I turn to art, especially music. Often a guitar riff could convey a feeling for me better than a phrase could.
3	I can enter and exit a room without being noticed aaaand there's also this thing about me being in this class or participating on an event but the professors can't seem to remember my name. Haha \n\nI guess this just goes with that 'isfp trait' of not being assuming, but also the fluctuating self-confidence.
2	I’m loving what I’ve read so far.  I’ll add: Varying moods.  I feel so different each day. 
3	What‘s your zodiac sign?	I’m wondering if there’s a relationship between zodiac signs and what your MBTI type is. \n\nI’m a libra sun and a scorpio moon. 
4	Taurus
5	Sun in Scorpio, Aquarius moon, isfp.
5	Cancer 
3	Aries sun Capricorn moon 
3	Libra sun Aquarius moon 
3	Cancer sun. Virgo moon, Leo rising
3	Libra sun, scorpio moon as well
3	Sagittarius sun, Libra rising, Cancer moon
2	Virgo sun 
2	Idk, how do I know? I'm a cancer though...
2	Scorpio sun and rising, Capricorn moon
2	Sun: Aquarius\n\nMoon: Pisces\n\nAscending: Aquarius\n\nI'm not the kind of person to believe in astrology but I do like that I'm Aquarius twice.
1	Libra sun, Aquarius moon 
1	Scorpio Sun, Cancer Moon, Aries Rising :)
1	Cancer sun, scorpio moon 🌊🌊🌊
1	Scorpio
1	Cancer sun and rising, Gemini moon
4	Am I an isfp?!	I've always considered myself an ISTP and then started wondering about INFP. Then someone suggested ISFP, which is something I'd never considered before. I read some descriptions of it that described it as an eccentric, social artist which didn't sound right. But a lot of details and the threads in this subreddit ring true in a way that the other MBTI subreddits never did.\n\nFor instance, I feel like I live life like a first person game. I observe a lot but don't really reflect on things. That isn't to say that I don't think or feel things, but I do it almost subconsciously. And in fact I do feel intensively, but it takes me a while to parse my emotions. And sometimes when I'm feeling something very strongly, my mind feels like it's looking at from a distance, like I'm playing a game.\n\nOther aspects that ring true are my high competitive streak, the way I rarely initiate contact even with my loved ones, how I have a fairly good taste in fashion and enjoy looking good, and how I am a (somewhat) well-regarded fanfiction writer. I love doing things for other people, and while I don't like parading the fact, I get easily upset if people don't recognize and appreciate my efforts. I am also sensitive to criticism, though that is an aspect I am actively trying to mend.\n\nDoes this all sound like an isfp? I am conflicted because I hate socializing with people I'm not familiar with--in party settings. I hate small talk and the pressure of wanting these people to enjoy my company. However, I do love smaller intimate social settings with people I am familiar with.\n\nA lot of isfp rings true for me and reading the threads in this subreddit has really put into words how I feel about my personality. What do you all think?
1	Sounds like a lot of types, have you looked in to functions? What do you think about Fi? How would you explain it? 
1	Don't base yourself on the description. It's what misleads 90 percent of people, because they're often stereotypical. But you do sound like an ISFP. :>
1	I thought I was an INFP for 3 years until I finally realized I was an ISFP. They both can act pretty similar to each other
15	Do you feel a strong need to rate everything you consume? (Games, music, movies, anime, etc)	I'm pretty obsessive in rating stuff, I also keep a list for everything (rateyourmusic for music and movies, anilist for anime, backloggery for games)\n\nI try to cut it a bit back for music, though, since I listen to so much and I change my opinion on music all the time.
7	I almost never feel the need to rate stuff, but I love keeping lists of my favourites (I also use anilist to keep track of what I’ve watched and all the stats)
4	Yes actually my colleague commented that I am very detailed and it's funny for them. If I like or dislike something I'll fully explain why and how that thing could be improved lmao. Makes me think I could be a great critic (food preferably ;) l
5	Nope, either I like it or I don’t. Don’t nobody got time for that. 
2	Absolutely. I love making like top ten lists for things like albums, movies, video games etc. 
1	This has never even crossed my mind. 
1	It's because of Fi. We build such a a personal attachment to things and our judgements of them so we have to tell the world. 
1	As others said, I like doing top 10s, favourite music folders, etc. 
1	I do it with films, i try to rate things like cinematography, soundtrack, story, characters etc.
1	I used to with films, mostly to get recommendations. But now if someone tells me i'll like something, i'm inclined to not like it! a catch-22. (but there is a part of me that likes sorting things).  \n  \nit's easier to just keep track of directors/musicians i like, and let serendipity, forums, whatever, fill in the rest.
1	Yea I tend to rate movies quite often..
1	Yea and the rating kind of goes like this. \n\nThis is so good I wonder what was on their mind when they made this. \n\nThis is pretty great but I have a few ideas how to make it even better. \n\nI dont dislike it. \n\nThere are a few good parts but the rest are dreadful. \n\nWhat the hell were they thinking when they made this?
1	Not really. I just... don't care about rating stuff.
14	Impatient?	When I want something I want it now. It keeps me up at night, like right now. \n\nMe and my girlfriend are selling our car, and buying a new one, and I want it all to happen now. Its 1:30 am and I should be sleeping but I was trying to upload the ad for the car to the marketplace. My girlfriend said before she fell asleep that we should do it tomorrow instead so we could do it properly, and I understand her logic. But I want it to happen now. Now I can't get the images to upload, so although I hate it I'll wait till the morning, and then we can also find some more info about our car to put in the ad. \n\nMy whole body is itching with this. Why? I don't understand. I see the logic that it can't all happen right away and its better to take it slow but still by body is itching with wanting to get a new car ASAP. If it's possible why not now. \n\nCan someone tell me why I might feel like this? It's not just now with the car. It's all things. Am I too materialistic. Scared that my interest will change? Unrealistic? Impatient??\n\nI hate this feeling! It's a physical feeling 
5	Is it feelings of anxiety? Maybe you want to get it done as soon as possible because the waiting game gives you stress and negative feelings associated with all the potential outcomes of that action. \n\nRemember you brain and very connected to your body. Emotions aren't always rational, so what you think can definitely translate to the physical feelings you're experiencing. Self-talk can help discipline your mind to think more positively, which can influence your emotions.
2	Do you feel like you cant relax and let you mind free flow naturally like usual? It gets really tiring being fixated on a single thing, when I cant do something that I want done right now I just start to imagine step by step how I would complete the task and possible outcomes. Its a nice distraction and makes you feel like you arnt wasting time doing nothing but preparing the best you can that will (in reality, just might) lead you to a better outcome. By imagining the outcome you may feel like the task is already complete and frees up your mind. 
2	This is why having a sturdy routine can be so tempting. . . The amount of times I've settled for shitty, easy to get jobs just because I'm fed up with the job application process. I just figured it was ADD, or the internet warping my brain.  \n  \nBut +1 to supportivepistachio. I just wanted to vent rather than be all useful and understanding and supportive.  \n  \nI remember when the mud guard on a mountain bike I had kept coming out of line, and wondering off to the side. A sensible, together sort of person would undo it to take it off, or tighten it up. I just ripped it off. Could not be fucked with it, was doing my head in. I don't know why I didn't turn out the calm, considered sort.  \n  \nYeah, I get how the irritable impatient-ness is a physical thing.
1	This is my with traveling. I typically book vacations relatively last minute due to this. I guess that's where some of the spontaneity comes in lol
6	I [30/m INFP] kissed best friend [24/f ISFP], now embarrassed hope I didn't ruin friendship	Now, recently she brought up the idea of coming over to my place to have a movie night. I was cool with it and randomly a few days ago text me and says she wants to have the movie night. So I agree and we meet at my house after work, then get booze. We get back to my place and have a long nice conversation and then go to my room to watch the movie we pick. We then both down the whole bottle of booze  in under two hours (I was blackout drunk). After the movie I'm pretty sure I rolled over to her on the bed and kissed her (like maybe for 5-10 seconds a few pecks I don't think tongue). As soon as I realize I'm kissing her and jump up off the bed and say I'm sorry and lead her to another room to sleep.\n\nShe goes to the other room and takes the covers with her. Not long after laying on my bed coverless (for a few minutes/two hours who knows) I go get her and tell her to come back to the bed with me. We get back in bed together and while keeping space between us (hammered but remorseful and half sleep) I kept telling her that I was sorry. She then responds by just saying my name (meaning she wants me to shut up) and says "what are you sorry for?".\n\nWhen we wake up I notice that she is in my hoodie and just some panties rolled over on me trying to tangle my legs and play footsie with me (at least that what it seemed like). Later we both wake up and do some talking for about an hour (not mentioning anything of the last night) and hugs me good bye and drives home (with my hoodie).\n\nNow we've been texting like normal for the last few days, but I think she has been avoiding seeing me so I can being back some stuff she left at my house (avoidance is a way she has dealt with stuff between us before). Also, I was suppose to accompany her to her first counseling appointment today. She actually wants me to just leave her stuff in my car during work so she can pick it up.\n\nShe's the best friend I've had in a very long time and I don't want to lose it. I'm sure she doesn't either.\n\nWe tell each other we love each other all the time and we've both talked about how much we mean to each other all the time.\n\nI'm aware of the consequences that can happen from this (loss of friendship, respect, avoidance, friendship worsening) . I just don't know how it'll go and I don't know what she could possibly be thinking. I'm prepared for anything and am not really worried about myself or my feelings as I have the tools to work through it. I'm more concerned with her feelings and how I could have affected her. She has had guy friends who try and get with her and I'm afraid that she thought she found someone different, but still got her trust betrayed. We give each other space all the time and are never in each other's business 24/7 so I don't mind that. I'm not in love with her or anything, so I'm not emotional over possibly being "rejected" just afraid that she thinks I might be in love with her. And really concerned with losing my best friend.\n\nOn one end I think I've messed up and believe that she might possibly have lost respect for me (she thinks I have it all together and I'm somewhat of a mentor to her at this point). On the other end I think maybe she's just weirded out and just needs time to sort out things? Heck, maybe she doesn't remember? Maybe there's some things I did that I didn't remember? I don't know?\n\nHow would some of you react in this situation? What do think she's thinking given the info?
3	I'm reading this a month later but i'm curious on how things went with you two. Are you guys okay?
2	When you kissed her was she kissing you back? If so, why did you jump out of the bed? This sounds like the situation was progressing naturally until you made things weird.
2	If she is your best friend, I think you should gather the courage to have an honest conversation with her. It sounds to me like she may be interested in you but is now avoiding you because your actions align with rejection.
20	Do you go through life like a first person game?	It's a bit hard to explain, but for example, lots of people identify with certain subcultures during high school, do self-reflection, do lots of stuff to get to know themselves and talk about themselves with others.\n\nBut I never really did that, I just observe and do stuff. I don't think about myself, who I am, and I don't really talk about myself either. I almost always talk about other people, or things I like doing.
12	I always thought of life like a first person movie. Like where I'm the main character and everything is shot through my eyes, but that's the same concept as a first person video game I suppose. But yes I can relate with you. Also, most of my dreams are in third person. Where I watch myself do things as if I'm the camera filming my body do things. 
5	Yeah... my whole life is a movie and I'm watching through my eyes 
5	Yeah, totally. I'm not sure if it's related, but I don't particularly like first person games either. Which is to say that I don't mind them, but pretty much 100% of the time I wish they were third person. Do other ISFP gamers feel the same way?
6	Interesting. I'm an INFJ and I have always felt like the narrator that third person watches other people. I wonder if there's Fe and Fi difference. 
5	Yeah pretty much. Sometimes I wish others could experience life through my eyes (and witness its beauty in all the sensory ways).\n\n(edit: but also sometimes I feel like I can't detach from my body and I view that as a bit problematic...)
3	My life feels like pieces of an "emotional narrative" ... recursive memories and a few scenes from movies contribute to a sense of meaning (or anti-meaning) that strings through my experiences. I don't see myself as a character in this existence, I just seek the continued external narrative, which is in truth a projection of my feelings onto my environment.
2	Wow, I never thought about it like that but it's so true. This is exactly how I've lived my life and you've put a term to it. Thanks.
1	I'm the same way.
1	Yup. That's why most of my main characters are that way too. They are somewhat more observant than taking action. 
6	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
9	Most successful pun?	Im hoping someone hasn't written a thread like this already. I'm just wondering the best pun that you have come up with? For me, I was at a football game as a highschool cheerleader and a common thing that the announcer would say was "flag on the play" quickly and with a deep tone. So at some point during the game there was a plastic bag strolling across the field and I took it upon myself to say "bag on the play" in the same manner. I got one pity laugh. That was a successful day to me thankyou. CaN yOU ToP IIIIIT!
7	One comes to my mind right now. My family was talking about Moses and the children of Israel’s journey through the wilderness, and my dad said “they didn’t have iPads to get through those forty years!” And I immediately replied with “but Moses did have a tablet”\n\nMy family laughed hard for a few minutes.\n\nI’ve had some really good puns, but they’re not coming to mind right now. 
3	One pun that I clearly remember:\n\nMy cousin and her husband were visiting my country in winter and we went to an ice skating rink (together with my INTP sibling). The cousin's husband didn't know how to skate, so he was led by my cousin and when they completed one round around the rink, I shouted "N-*ICE* going!" to them. \n\nThey both laughed. My sibling (INTP) just kinda shook her head and said "You must be really proud of that pun huh... "\n\nI had made another ice pun but I don't really remember it.
2	Interpersonal dynamics	Whenever you have a new acquaintance, perhaps a new colleague, have you noticed them mimicing the unique things that we do? In obvious way like rotate their hat a certain way even though you know they don't do that bc you were doing it. This might just be a socialogical thing and not mbti but I wanted to bring it up.
3	The good ISFP friend that I have has permanently changed the way I type on mobile - with no caps.
1	Mirroring others is a sign of likeability. So they probably like you. It’s usually unconscious too. 
1	I've noticed this with ESFPs
5	What have you done for someone else?	
5	Gave an electric fan, dog food, and canned food to my elderly neighbour with no air-con and only $25 for food for the next 10 days. 
2	Graced them with my presence 
5	Quotes/saying we live by	On mobile\n\nScrolling through here I see a lot of people that are struggling, so figured why not start a string of some of our favorite quotes or sayings for those who are struggling to read for motivation.\n\nMy personal favorites:\n\n-My past shaped who I am today. Today shapes who I will be tomorrow.\n\n- Think more than you speak, know more than you say, notice more then they realize.\n\n-Give it all or give it up.\n\n-I do it for you\n\n-Both the sheep and the wolf are wandering through life.\n
4	"A flower does not think of competing with the flower next to it. It just blooms" - Zen Shin\n\n"As we go through life we gradually discover who we are, but the more we discover, the more we lose ourselves. " - Haruki Murakami
3	"This too shall pass"
2	"I ain't no god damn son of a bitch / (You better think about it baby)"
1	"I'm a man of fortune, and I must seek my fortune"
2	Gifts	What sort of gifts do you think would suit an ISFP? From an ENTP. Generalising of course
9	I don't think it matters too much, as long as it shows that you were thinking of them.
7	Maybe a handmade food thing. Consumables are often a safe gift.  \n  \nOr, do you know their interests? Musical instruments, art supplies. Tickets to something they'd enjoy. I'm just spitballing.  \n  \n
5	Handmade stuff is always extra special. :)
5	I like heartfelt cards and practical gifts that I can make use out of.
4	Probably something hand-made, but with minimalistic design. Keep yourself grounded in reality.
2	Girlfriend?\n\nEat her!
2	Something related to their hobby, our favourite food, experiences like a massage <333
2	Best gift I ever got personally was a slackline. Practical, hobby-oriented, personal, invites activity and bonding time, and honestly I still have it. 
1	Unless it's something i want or hand made like a drawing, post card etc., i find gifts to be forced and i don't really like to act like i like it, it makes me feel kinda bad
2	(Cross-post) Temperament and Humor (All over 14 Welcome)	 Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic\_temperament\_and\_humor\_all\_over\_14\_welcome/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/)
16	What type of person do you feel alive around? What type of person brings you down?	Is there a certain type that gives you life, takes you out of your head?\n\nOn the opposite spectrum, is there a type that makes you feel restricted?
19	I feel alive around: People who are positive and fun.\n\nI feel dead around: People who are negative and boring.\n
7	Extroverts for sure. As long as they are not too loud and obnoxious. Most of my friends are extroverts and they see me as extroverted because when I’m with them I come out of my shell. It can be tiring but I still love it. \n\nOther introverts will sometimes bring me down. But introverts in my life that I’m close to are really enjoyable to be around because we can either sit comfortably in silence or we can have quiet conversations about things that interest us. 
7	ENFP. But my sample size is one so who knows
3	[deleted]
2	I feel alive around people who let me be myself, who don't text me everyday, who don't try to make me conform to their expectations, and who are honest, more than everything else.\n\nI feel awful with the kind of people who text you everyday, all day, who subtly make everything go in THEIR direction, who blow hot and cold, who try to control everything, and who lie. Also, I hate loud people.
6	What's your favorite band?	I'm less of a rap/hip-hop fan, I'm more on the blues and rock side of the spectrum.
8	Red Hot Chili Peppers!
8	Radiohead
6	QOTSA
5	I love stoner/doom metal. Elder is probably one of my favs.
3	Neurosis or Yob
3	Weezer
2	Breaking Benjamin
2	The Birthday Massacre
2	Artist? Burial.\n\nBand? Mucc, probably. Or Asian Kung-Fu Generation
2	PARAMORE
2	As I've gotten older, I've started to appreciate Deftones and their recordings more.
2	Led Zeppelin!
1	Grandbrothers 
1	I listen to a lot of Charli XCX now a days, but I'll listen to anything really. Today was a Marilyn Manson/Nine Inch Nails kinda day 🤟
1	The Oh Hellos or Lord Huron.
1	Dinosaur Jr
1	Imagine Dragons!!!!!!!!!!!!  All the way.  But I like all music.  I have an extensive library on my IPod that I can listen to whenever I want to.
1	Probably Dream Theater, Byzantine, or King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. At the moment at least. But my favourite tends to fluctuate pretty often.
12	Is this common for introverts? Does this make me an ISFP or is it just social anxiety?	I love being with people and being invited out to stuff, I’d always choose going out to staying home alone, but yet I’m shy to approach people. Crowds aren’t a problem for some reason, but when I’m like sitting on the bus for example, or in the waiting room, I can’t seem strike up a conversation with anyone. They’re sitting across the room and I’m just like “wow geez this is awkward as shit, I really want to talk to them but I can’t, oh shit they just glanced at me, I need to say something and hope they’re welcoming.” I’m sitting there feeling self conscious, I’d like to talk to them but I can’t find a way to do it, and I’m scared I’m going to be awkward and stuttery about it, I’m pretty sure this is just basic ass social anxiety but Idk I want your thoughts. Is this common for introverts or am I just fucking myself?
3	You don't strike me as introvert, more extrovert, although I'm not an expert. I'm see myself as pretty introvert and would never dream of starting a conversation with someone I don't know on a bus or in a waiting room. I would prefer people leaving me alone in situations like that, cause I know it's gonna end in awkwardness af. I have a friend that's kind of like you, wanting to talk all the time with everybody because silence makes him uncomfortable. 
3	To get it out of the way, being introverted simply implies that being around people, talking and paying attention to them takes away from your energy, instead of making you more energetic, as is the case with extroverts.\n\nI feel like being shy or awkward isn’t related to being introverted. I believe it has more to do with certain feelings, perceptions or skills that could be worked on.\n\nI’m gonna write a long annoying response to this because it hit home. Hope I don’t sound condescending in any way.\n\nBeing on the bus is such a small thing at first glance/ or to some people probably. But if you think about it is a bit complicated. You’re in this tight space with 20 or so strangers, got nothing else to do than observe them or engage them until you get to your B point but you can’t because...they’re still strangers even though they’re right next to you.\n\n*Insert quote from favorite book, which i’m trying really hard not to shove in everyone’s face:*\n\n>"\[Man\] would become insane could he not liberate himself from this prison and reach out, unite himself in some form or other with men, with the world outside.  \n>  \n>The experience of separateness arouses anxiety; it is, indeed, the source of all anxiety. Being separate means being cut off, without any capacity to use my human powers.  \n>  \n>**Hence to be separate means to be helpless, unable to grasp the world - things and people - actively; it means that the world can invade me without my ability to react.**  \n>  \n>**The awareness of human separation, without reunion by love - is the source of shame. It is at the same time the source of guilt and anxiety.**”\n\nWhat I do to try and enjoy my bus rides is this. I think of all the people as my friends. As interesting, complex, busy fellow human beings. I love them for their different qualities and defects and I believe in their kindness and potential. Yet I know that I just won’t see them for too long because we’re all just trying to get to a certain place.\n\nBy slowly practicing love and compassion with strangers it becomes easier to be among them. Maybe not in public transport, because people are often frustrated, tired, preoccupied etc. But smiling to your waiter, cashier, old lady walking her dog is nice. If you wanna go more into it, we’re technically not really strangers. We’re like bees in a beehive, part of an organism.\n\nBible has a version of that.\n\n>“You know the heart of the stranger” says the Old Testament, “for you were strangers in the land of Egypt;... therefore love the stranger!”\n\nReligion aside, it is a pretty nice sentiment.\n\nIf this anxious feeling stays with you, It would be useful to talk to anyone close to you about it. Or even in a therapy session. Like going to the doctor’s for a tummy ache except in this case your soul hurts a bit. If it’s really anxiety and you have the means to treat it you should try to.\n\nYou could be an anxious extrovert or a curios introvert or anything in between.\n\nMuch love from a similar human, -infp
1	A few years back, my mentor insisted that I was an extrovert, and I maintained I was an introvert.  Upon doing some reading and talking to people, I realized that she was right. I was probably an extrovert with some pretty severe social anxiety. I have been seeing a therapist for about 18 months (she is fantastic) and as I am breaking down these anxiety walls I am finding myself feeling more and more extroverted. It’s an amazing feeling.\n\nReflecting on that, I had always equated not liking attention or being in crowds with introversion. I am finding as I discuss with my truly introverted friends the visible difference is by and large, they would be happy as a hermit with little to no human interaction for extended periods of time. I myself, would get exhausted frazzled around people, but depressed if I go more then a couple of days without seeing people. The frazzled around people is way down (but still present) but the exhaustion around people is mostly gone. Now I feel energized when I spend time with people and still start to slip towards depression on my own for too long. It’s how I recognized the difference. \n\nBased what you described above, it sounds like what you are experiencing is quite similar to how I experience social anxiety. Preoccupation with how others see and view me has lead to thousands of encounters like you described above. 
5	I'm so tired of this ISFP	HE'S SO HOT AND COLD. \n\nWe met twice. We spent 2 nights together, held long conversations until 3am in his car - and I hope I'm not over idealizing things but I did feel a connection. Things were super comfortable with him. \n\nBut after we parted, NOTHING. He never reached out to me (except through Snapchat because we have a streak). When I attempted to text him, his replies seemed, dispassionate? It's been 2 days. Is he not into me or something! 
6	Yeah, ISFPs tend not to initiate. You’re going to have to do all the initiation, and face to face interaction is much better than phone.
6	Ask him. ISFPs tend to not really judge people if they bring up personal topics. I'm sure he'd understand how you're feeling.
5	As an ISFP, I will give you my two cents. \n\nI rarely ever reach out to people, even if I care deeply about them, because I'm very "detached" and I don't miss them. I just don't feel it. I'd be there for them if they were in a crisis, I'd reply if they text, but I'd never, ever initiate contact, because I'm often busy doing my things, and generally not a big talker. Also, someone in the comments said face to face interaction is better, and I agree. \n\nSo don't worry so much. Try to reach out to him. If you feel a connection, there probably is one.
2	You have to do a lot of initial moves here, and in person.\nI've been with my wife for 12 something years, and still have to gently push her :-)\n\nThey have there own little world, or they are just shy....
1	It could be one of two ways: He could be just as interested and is just playing it cool because he doesn't want to come off intense, or he's not interested. It's annoying, but gentle tugs to get the real answers tend to be a thing. I'm with the other commenter that said you'll have to do all the initiation. 
6	What are your favorite conversation topics?	I like to rant about society, philosophy, psychology, speculating about random stuff, gossiping/ranting about people I dislike, anime, jokes, and overall I always have stuff to say somehow. I wonder what sensors like to talk about though, feels like when they start talking about certain things I run out of things to say lol but I dont know if its a sensor thing or just me. I also wonder if its possible to exercise Se while talking about something. I'M REALLY CURIOUS PLS FEED ME \n
10	I like listening to people and what gets them going... I also like talking about my current micro-passion, hobby or project or idea I might have right that moment. \n\nEvery time when I'm in a group conversation and I try to contribute with an anecdote I kinda mess up the punchline and the story is anticlimactic.. I'm not good at articulating my thoughts 
5	I'm really curious about people, their interests and experiences and their overall view of life. I could be satisfied just listening to them about their worldview and opinions since I'm constantly on gathering-new-information-about-different-people -mode. Not too big on broad subjects like politics. Would be nice if we had some overlapping interests. \n\nAlso, it's nothing to be ashamed of if you run out of things to say. Heck I do it sometimes lol. (Dunno if that's what you needed, but.) If you want to exercise Se while talking just do something while you're talking lol (at least that would be the easiest advice to give for me) \n\nHope this helped!
3	i mostly listen to people. i dont talk much either because i’m afraid they won’t have the same level of enthusiasm as me or because i think they don’t care. those topics mostly being cars and games lol so i could see why i dont have tons of people to talk to
3	I love to talk about sociology/psychology/technology/economics (at a high level, even through I read to a minute level I find it hard to articulate and prefer to give overviews of how things in these areas connect). Usually these all relate to people and why people do/use things the way they do. I also like to talk about places/travel and people and their personalities :P I can be a bit bitchy when the people I'm with are being super nice and non-judgemental (do you not have ANYTHING to say) and then when I'm around super rude/judgemental people I usually stay out of it haha! (Enough people are shitting on this person, I should stick up for them or remove myself).
2	Mental health, video games, and other miscellaneous topics. And I usually never start the conversation, I make the transition.
1	Traveling experiences, exercise, food, movies, books, spirituality, and paranormal topics!!!
7	I could use some perspective with my isfp-tested girlfriend that struggles with commitment anxiety	We are a couple of 23 y.o.in a long distance relationship for 2 years ( isfp and intj-tested, eventhough i am not a fan of  typology) and besides the fact that we only meet a few days per month, it could not be better. We both think we found the one for life genuinely and love each other (i know she does). Still, she does not want to move in with me nor can guarantee that she wants to so in the next few years, which is killing me, especially because i would move to different planets in order to be with her. On the other, not so romantic side, i don´t want to waste these years until we move together just to find out it doesn´t work out. I know you isfps don´t handle life very strategically, but perceive the course more like a movie sometimes, and at some point i guess it would just feel right for her, and it would eventually happen. But i dont want that gamble, and i am afraid that despite her love at some point, even if we will move together, she might just feel like parting ways one day. I could never leave her anyway, though. Also, she says she is afraid of moving in together because it might ruin our relationship. I, on the other side, cant wait to  try it out and optimize living together.\n\nI guess it is normal in that age to have commitment phobia and it will fade at some point, and i am just the oppositve in terms of planning and strategy. But perhaps i am missing something. What are your experiences with commiting anxiety? Will it change, and when? Is there some way way to accelerate that process?\n\nJust some thoughts and perspectives that i miss would help me a lot. \n\nOh and if this highly reductionistic model of personality would be as precise as most people think it is: Y´all are beautiful creatures 
7	You two need to communicate, it sounds like you've just skirted the issues at this point.\n\n1. Does she take you seriously? Does she want a future with you? Even if it's not 5 years from now - you can frame it like, do you want me to be part of your life now and however far ahead you can imagine?\n2. What are your expectations for moving in? At what point in a relationship do you consider it acceptable to live together?\n\na) She is likely fearful of what living together would entail. ISFPs have their whole, own little world in their homes. There might be parts of her that you don't know. For instance, I have solo dance parties in my room listening to music whenever I feel like it. This could be at 11PM. You can't really do that living with someone. Also, I'm a lot messier than I appear (I keep things tidy for guests). There are a lot fo embarrassing things that she doesn't want to be judged for, but you should take the initiative to open the conversation and put everything on the table about the fears she has and the type of "roommate" you will be as well. Another would be, independence and alone time. Living together, how much alone time do you expect to give each other? There are many questions to consider and facets to look into before even deciding that living together is something you want to do.\n\n3) Being afraid of commitment doesn't necessarily mean she is not devoted to you. It may just be that she has fears of her future and can't really discuss how they relate or align with yours because she may not have them mapped out yet. She needs a partner that will ensure this is not a hinderance to the relationship and that she will be supported throughout her life path. Can a planner such as a J do this? That's up to you.\n\n4) Finally, has your relationship ever been non-long distance? The dynamic of a LDR is vastly different and she may not want a relationship with a lot of 'we' time. Maybe she likes that your lives are separate. This I can't speculate on but it's something to explore. A lot of LDRs can end because you realize you are not right for each other and the LDR mostly just idealized the relationship and qualities of the other person.
2	Hey, I don't know. Is there a compromise? Move within the same city / town, and ease into it? Have one visit the other if you haven't done that yet, for a week(end), and just see how it goes? I don't really know what she's anxious about (but also it's not my business).  \n  \nI'm a bit fucked, and may have fugued over a bunch of your sentences.
2	I, too, have committment issues.\n\nI've been with someone i deeply loved for 8years. I was 28. When it became clear that the next step was living together, sharing every moment, and starting a family, I got anxious and felt something was wrong. Moreover, I wanted to expatriate, and he didn't want to follow me.\nHe was good, just not the right one for me.\n\nNow I'm in a ldr since 2ys with an intj and I am moving to his country and it sounds the best decision of all. I'm sure of what I'm doing and I don't freak out imagining a life with him.\n\nThere's a couple things: You are young. Maybe she's not ready to play family with you yet. \nWhy is it implied that she has to move? What about you moving?\n\nAlso in my experience intjs tend to be a tad idealistic and impractical, specially compared to isfps. "Everything will be alright, we will make it work..." Except you may miss what the actual moving country and living together is like.
2	Have a serious discussion with her about it, tell her you don't need her to decide right this second, and then give her a long timeline. She probably just needs time to think it over and decide what she wants. This part is important, though: after the discussion, don't nag her about it. Don't bring it up again for at least a month. We're like cats. we want time to decide, and if we feel you're pressuring us it's likely to just not happen. 
2	So I'm much older, but I'm an isfp and my boyfriend is an intj and he asked me to move in (I said no and we agreed to revisit the subject in 6 months). So similar situation, but I have other things to worry about. Anyways the way you come off a bit is that this is an experiment. "Let's move in together! I love you and I want to see what happens!" I'm probably just projecting but moving in with someone that I want to make a life with and be with forever or at least a very long time (I wouldn't want to move in if I saw an end) is serious. When you phrase it as an experiment it doesn't feel serious (as in you won't work hard to make it work; you are just trying to see if it will work out). I hope that makes sense. 
4	What is happiness?	
4	Baby don't hurt m--oh, hm.
3	Happiness is your dog silently cuddling next to you in the first hours of the morning; it's your mom cooking your favourite dish when you had a rough day; it's the breeze in your hair when chilling on the balcony. Happiness is finally recognizing all your achievements; it's knowing that if anything fails, you can count on yourself. Happiness is slacking on a day off, it's seeing a flower on that cactus you bought that miraculously didn't die like all the other plants. Happiness is being alive, being part of the amazing wonders of the universe. It's having a supportive partner; it's crying in awe at northern lights; it's finding that beautiful colorful cheap bra.\n\nI can't even imagine not being able to find happiness around me.\nTo quote Wordsworth: \n"My heart leaps up/\nWhen I behold/\nA rainbow in the sky;/\nSo was it when I was a child/\nSo it is now I am a man/\nSo be it when I shall grow old/\nOr let me die!"
3	Hapiness is not having to dread the next morning because you have your alarm clock set so you'll be on time for you shitty job that you hate... when you find something that you like doing that fulfils you and can make a living off I think you can be truly happy. It's not the only thing needed for happiness but it's a big part. I'm almost truly happy, although not unhappy \n\nAlso a Land Rover Defender 110 would make me super happy 
3	Something in a box. Kittens, french fries, paint supplies, a brand spanking new keyboard-or anything new, really. Your old letters to your favorite significant other that you're no longer with but hold sweet memories with. The tee shirts and old jeans that you've stopped wearing and are dropping off to donate at the thrift shop-that feeling of freeing yourself from excess junk that you no longer need. Chocolates. Some of your toys that you just found in your mom's attic that you thought were lost in that last move. A ring bought with the best of intentions. 
2	Fuck if i know  \n  \ni'm like some old engine i just keep putting fuel in purely out of habit
2	Doing what you love. Even if it doesn't conform to society's standards.
1	Contentment maybe?
1	The opposite of pain. 
3	Am I ESFP or one of you?	I've taken quite a few MBTI tests online and I always end up 50/50. Here are some details about me: \n\n\n\n* I struggle with making close friends; I don't want to open up to people because I'm afraid that they may not be worth the effort\n\n\n* I build rapport quickly but I am also socially awkward to some extent\n\n\n* One of my acquaintances told me that I seem emotionally closed-off and not bubbly, especially for someone in my line of work (I'm a receptionist). \n\n\n\n* I'm uncomfortable in a leadership role. I don't like being bossed around, so I avoid imposing myself on others\n\n\n\n* I'd like to think that I have strong aesthetics. I receive a lot of compliments on my style choices\n\n\n\n* Here's a conundrum: I love going to events involving loud music, dancing, and autosports. However, I would just wander around and do my own thing instead of socializing with strangers. I just don't feel the incentive to do so. \n\n\n\n* Hobbies: gaming, ATVing (I love taking physical risks and anything with speed/power), hiking, browsing the web\n\n\n\n* long-term planning is my archnemesis \n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for the insight!
2	What you described above doesn't massively pertain to being either introverted or extroverted. An introvert can easily enjoy busy events and an extrovert can be happy enough alone. \n\nWhen you're around people and socialising do you come away feeling rejuvenated and energised, or do you feel like you want time alone to decompress and refuel. 
1	You sound a bit like me. I’m quite certain I am an ISFP. I like to socialize at times but I also do a lot on my own and it takes a while for me to connect and trust people and consider them friends and not just acquaintances or people I hang out with sometimes. \n\nI’m also pretty big into the fun and exhilarating activities. I’ve never really been into team sports though; I worry about disappointing people.
27	Reminder from another ISFP	Don't let yourself become the prey of narcissistic, one-sided friendships.
12	The thing with narcissists they often have a lot of initial charm, and that can draw a lot of people in, since people are very influenced by first impressions. Some can come across as very confident and assertive which is a trait that ISFPs can be drawn to. \n
3	Good advice for anyone.
3	Aka, my first (and only!) marriage. I had no idea people like that existed.
2	Thank you.
1	A good reminder for us is to also not let ourselves become that friend! 
1	Luckily, I rarely ever speak to people, so I'm in the clear.
5	How can I tell if I have dom Fi vs aux Fi? I’m not sure how I can find out. Help would be appreciated. Thank you	
3	INFP here, I find Fi aux to be much more excitable then Fi doms. Fi doms have a tendency to be more expressive, withdrawn, and perhaps genuine. Would you say that it is more difficult to predict trends or get something accomplished?
2	Fi aux are more adept at using Te, compared to Fi dom, who have inferior Te. This translates to ENFP and ESFP being more proactive and on the go (Ne/Te, Se/Te), compared to INFP and ISFP, who have a tendency to self-ruminate (Fi/Ni, Fi/Si).
11	How do you all deal with difficult people?	People you dislike, bosses who are controlling, people who dislike you, people who hurt you, and difficult people in general? \n\nFirst time posting on this sub and a bit nervous asking because it might be a personal question for some of you guys. \n\nI personally just try to avoid difficult people as much as possible. Once an acquaintance decides to step on my Fi, I start ignoring them and being dismissive of them when they talk to me. If we have mutual friends, they'd have to be understanding of that. Though if a long time friend hurts my Fi, I'm open to a lot of chances and negotiations with them. That said, it's usually not easy to offend me, and if someone apologizes I usually forgive them. I almost always dislike anyone who dislikes me though. For controlling people, I usually just have to put up with them because I usually need something from them until I find something better. 
10	I totally agree with you, I try to avoid everybody and everything that tends to make my life more difficult than usual. But of course this doesn't work for everyone I meet. With close friends who grind my gears, i do my best to play along with their bullshit and don't let them get the better of me.
4	Emotionally cut them off completely. They're not a "person" person any more, they just exist. I feel like my phrasing is kind of incoherent. Basically, I stop nurturing the relationship. No more information about myself, no more emotional interest. Grey rock method. 
3	With co workers or bosses who i feel have been condescending, overly controlling, or disrespectful toward me ( which happens RARELY) im usually as non confrontational and as calm as possible. I dont say emotionally charged things but i can tell that when im upset its very readable. I cant help it, i can tell because i Can feel my facial expression and body language etc. I get quiet and terse. I usually try to keep an open mind though and give them the benefit of the doubt because im imperfect and theyre imperfect and our perceptions might just clash or it might just be my ego. So the next day im usually cautious but try to be cordial and open to them. If it happens consistently i avoid that person as much as possible and just act civil toward them if i need to talk to them. 
3	I'll do just like you. I try to avoid them as much as possible. No time, no energy for them. If we have mutual friends, I will make a conversation with one of them when it's possible. I'm not particularly aggressive, however when you cross the line, you've crossed it for good, and you're out of my life. I don't look back on the people I throw out of the window.
1	What (s)he (OP) said
1	As someone who is and certainly used to be more sensitive I am quite good at perceiving aggressions against myself and working them up in my head.  I used to do no contact very easily, and cut out acquaintances and friends who had done me wrong as a kind of coping mechanism. This is an unhealthy behaviour that I think I got from my Mom (who I now see as rather lonely, go figure) and is a result of my personality. Now I definitely try to be more accepting, apologetic. For instance in work recently a colleague lied to me about something kind of important. I don't work directly with them much but when I found out they lied to me I was very cold towards them in group scenarios for about a week. I couldn't actually 'help' this behaviour in myself, but eventually I snapped out of it and told myself to forgive him but not forget and moving forward to not give him the chance to lie to me again or call him out sooner. Staying silent and being passive aggressive was a childish behaviour but I think in the past (I used to come out as turbulent in 16 personalities test and am now about 75% A) I would have continued the blocking out and non communication.\n\nIt also helps to step back and examine my own behaviour and remember my own failings in the past. I think I used to have a very hard time when people didn't react as I wanted them to, when friends let me down it would hurt very badly and when people were callous to me I would chalk it down to their failings of character. All the while I would never remember how callous and silly I could be sometimes. I lean more towards selfishly thinking about how my actions and other peoples actions affect ME, but as isfps if we exert a little bit of effort we can easily be empathetic. 
13	A rant about Fe-doms (ESFJ, ENFJ)	Fe-doms are said to be the best match for us, and I regularly find myself being attracted to them at firs, but I realize I can't stand them after a while. I find them increasingly annoying. Their whole thing of "I know what's best for you, and I know better than you what you need", "that's not good, you should change". Bullshit, you don't know me, you don't know someone better than they know themselves, and I'm not changing. I am myself, and I deserve to be myself like anyone deserves it. Their thing of giving overly sweet nicknames to every single of their friends ("darling", "sweetie", "my dear"). I rarely ever give nicknames like that. The Fe-doms I met also have that thing of being "friends" with everyone until you cross them, and have that "it's either with us or against us" thing. They're shallow, pretend to be open-minded while they won't accept anything that doesn't fit their codes, and will smile while they backstab you. Maybe I didn't meet the right ones too, that could be why I'm currently ranting. But I rarely ever can stand them. Yet, they're said to be the best match for us ISFPs. Fuck no. I'm never marrying one of them. I wouldn't be able to stand them for a lifetime.
11	It's refreshing to see a non-NT who sees it as well.  I'm an INTJ and you hit the nail on the head on the most annoying characteristics of Fe-doms.  What I resent the most is that they insist on shoving their emotional burden onto others, instead of owning that they are having a poor reaction to something that someone said/did, that was not meant in a negative way... but they take offense to it and then they try to make the other person feel bad about it and blame them.
5	Sounds like immature Fe-doms to me. Both my colleagues are ESFJ and ENFJ and they never boss me around like that.
4	[deleted]
3	[deleted]
3	The only thing that annoys me is that they always seem to believe they know what's best for you and don't accept whatever you do instead (I know they want the best, duh).
2	Probably immature Fe doms are like that. I do know exactly what youre talking about tho lol.
2	Probably you have met immature Fe doms? I have so many IxFPs who are very close to my heart and who I deeply love, and we understand each other on a very deep level, especially when it comes to our feelings and emotions. We get along very well! :)
1	> Fe-doms are said to be the best match for us, and I regularly find myself being attracted to them at firs, but I realize I can't stand them after a while. I find them increasingly annoying.    \n     \nIt's not Fe-doms but Te-doms. The function that Fi helps to counter-balance is Te: [**ISFP Love Types**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/isfp-articles/288-love-types-isfp-11.html#post22271698) so if you have been going after Fe-doms that is the source of your problems.
1	I've met both good and bad high Fe users.\n\nThe most annoying was this guy (IXFJ) who would push his opinions onto me and try to control my actions, ended our friendship pretty fast. We are in the same major and he would look after all the other students like a mother hen and sacrifice a lot of his time to help them so I admired him at first but then decided he needed to spend more time bringing his own grades up. \n\nMy mother, an ESFJ, is a narcissist and would try to control me to the point of stalking my facebook messages. She hates it when I'm not sweet and nice to her and acts really fakely nice and the life of party to guests. \n\nThough one of my good friends is Fe and he made me realize that group dynamics are really important and looked after everyone in a non-controlling way. He said that he's happiest when everyone else is.

12	35 Signs You Are An ISFP	
1	Hm everything matches me except for being competitive. \n\nAre others here competitive? 
1	The text goes a little fast. A trick to fix this is reading out loud the text 3 times, so every viewer can read it without pausing. Nevertheless, great video!
-2	lol y'all ni🅱️🅱️as are retarded for watching dis shit.

Sigh. If there's any type that knows what's socially appropriate the best it's ISFP. Fucking hell. Maybe they are thinking of NTPs or something\n32, ok, how the fuck can you tell me they lack the emotional intelligence to figure out just what's socially appropriate then one second later tell me they have so much emotional intelligence they can read people just from subtle body cues? This video is more inconsistent than ISFPs themselves. But yes #32 is correct.\n33 can be anyone\n34 is incorrect\n35 is forer effect\nConclusion: 9/35 are correct. MBTI understanding of ISFP seems to be either my understand of ISFJ overall or just throwing words around.
2	enthusiasm and interest for other persons feelings	Hi isfp´s im in a relationship with an isfp and im missing so much that my partner gives me some enthusiasm or interest and speaks with me about my feelings. \nis this an isfp thing? when yes what would you recommend me ? \ni really love my partner and want to understand more. 
3	In my relationship, I feel awkward taking the initiative to show enthusiasm for my partner and ask about their interests and their feelings, because I am not sure when to be vulnerable with my partner even though it is important (if they don't care, I don't want to be stung for asking).\n\nBUT if my significant other told me that showing interest *really* makes them happy and brightens their day, I would do it all the time! So I recommend telling your partner that you truly enjoy it when they enthusiastically support you and that you cherish exchanging thoughts and feelings with them. I think the ISFP wants to be emotionally committed and supportive to their partners, but at least I am not always sure how :/ 
49	Heard you guys like sunsets so here’s one from an INFP :)	
5	I love Infps and sunsets. :) seriously almost every person I love in my life is infp
3	Thank you for sharing it :) the colors and textures in this photo feel like nourishment
2	Awe thanks :)
1	I recently found out I’m ISFP/ISFT— are sunsets something ISFPs particularly enjoy? Because I’ve always been extremely attracted to them and a hobby of mine would be to find new beaches and parks in my area to watch sunsets from. Huh.
26	Originally posted on INFP, was told to post here	
5	Infps are the best 
5	What am I supposed to do with this?
2	I like it
7	What's your personal philosophy about buying things/consumption?	How do you feel about consumption, materialism, self-expression through items, marketing, spending money, popular trends, or any related topic?\n\nI tend to hold back on buying long-lasting things until I feel sure that it will help me be authentically me.\n\nI buy a variety of foods each week, I express myself in my food tastes I suppose.\n\nI no longer believe that I can love a song forever and expect my musical tastes to change.\n\nThough I recognize that materials can help people express, I am also scared of getting in a cycle of spending money and buying things which are in the end, transient clutter. How about you?
6	I often get really fed up of all my stuff and get the urge to declutter. Throwing stuff out is often more cathartic than selling it. Typically when I move out of a place I leave half a dozen bin bags in my wake.
5	I am constantly looking at what I own and what I can get rid of. But when I do purchase something, I make sure that it's something I really love. Unfortunately, this has the consequence of spending a lot of time researching... and the item I really like is often 10x more expensive than something else that does the same purpose. Most of the items I do buy have to serve a purpose, while simultaneously being aesthetically pleasing. 
4	I consume massive amounts of media, and when I'm unhealthy I have a an impulse buying problem. Usually the stuff i watch read or listen to is stuff that aligns with my sense of authenticity,like Indie and diy stuff, however, sometimes I will partake of media that is at least partly big and dumb and explosive, because I think its inauthentic to deny that part of myself.\n\n I'm constantly rebeling against my own values because I think values are stupid
3	When it comes to physical goods, I like to treasure my things until they fall apart, and I like fixing and patching them up (with varying degrees of competence). I feel like the more I've had to do that, the more it becomes mine and mine only. Looking at the patched-over bits is really satisfying because it's like, "look what we've been through together!". Like a scar or a callus, but for objects.\n\nWhen I do get the urge to acquire something random and pretty, I'll head to the thrift store. I don't think an appetite for niceties is a bad thing necessarily, but I still feel bad about it a lot of the time. Keeping it second-hand helps me feel less so, and if I lose interest in the thing, I can always donate it back. I like this because I get to engage with the material world without contributing tooooo much clutter to it.
3	If i buy stuff i like it to be good quality stuff that i actually really like. I dont buy stuff that i *sort of* like or buy stuff for the sake of buying stuff. I have to fall in love with it. Any shopping i do is second hand for the most part for sort of a moral reason but mostly because its cheaper and i like the treasure hunting feeling that i get from it. I also like to buy stuff from artists if i can. I have never had the mentality of "must have the latest upgrade, must have the latest thing". If im buying something its because it has mainly personal and/or practical value not because its a status symbol to have it. If i start to feel cluttered i get rid of things in a frenzy. I like a degree of minimalism and its refreshing with letting go of things. However I MOSTLY spend my money on going out to eat or getting a deep conditioner treatment or a massage tho. I like enjoyable sensual experiences more than having stuff.
5	Trust	[deleted]
2	That's a difficult situation. I know some people with parents like that. The only real option is to get away, but it's totally okay to view it as a long term goal, and do it in baby steps. Like, even just taking 5 minutes longer to get back to them than you normally would. Doing more things without them, not telling them things, etc. Small things add up, and each one gives you a little more control over the situation. \n\nGood luck...
2	I am not totally sure why, but I do not trust my mother.\n\nWhat helps me is I do what I want her to do. If I want her to show me, in action, that she loves me? Then I do things for myself that show I love myself. If I wish she would give me guidance, then I take some time to listen to my inner wisdom and practice rational decision-making. \n\nLet's say you wish your spouse wouldn't describe intimate details or tell falsities to other people. You could try affirming to yourself that you try to be a good person and why it's perfectly acceptable to have insecurities and weaknesses. Let's say your coworker lies about blame in a sticky situation or wants credit when things go well. Try congratulating yourself for your own successes and thinking positively about small failings. If a roommate steals your stuff but you have to live with them for a while (see how ridiculous it is to try and withstand other people's bs lol?) , take the opportunity to be an extra honest samaritan and show respect for the living standards in the home. Focusing on yourself when other people are bugging you can feel like a small relief ... you start to care less about their actions, thus they bother you less.\n\nStill, this isn't the most healthy option and it's not a fix. I agree, the best option is to get away or have respectful conversations about what needs to change for the love/work/living relationship to be sustainable.\n\nIs marriage therapy not an option?
2	Unfortunately I don't have good news for you. My first marriage was the situation you describe, and because my self-esteem had been eroded I morally snapped and started cheating, but then the guilt would eat me alive and I would tell my wife, thus increasing her lying to me. It was horrible. \n\nI went to therapy, she refused to go. When I knew that I had done all I could and she refused to be flexible I initiated a divorce. It wasn't pretty. But I was emotionally unstable at that time and it was years ago, before I knew who I was. I hope you are much more confident in yourself and can approach your issues in a much more constructive way than I did at the time. I wish you the best.
6	Am I an isfp?	I've taken the 16personalities type test multiple times (and one or two other free tests) and they all say I'm an isfp. I do identidy with some of the isfp stereotypes, but I tend to score pretty 50/50 on all my traits. Can any of you help me figure this out?
6	The stereotypes can be hit or miss for a lot of people. I think it's bet to focus on the cognitive functions. I would suggest you take the [typeinmind](https://www.typeinmind.com/assessment/) test. While the test is simple and short it also features descriptions of how the functions affect each type.
2	Try some more in-depth questionnaires than 16 personalities, they may be able to narrow it down better for you with more specific scenarios.
5	Do you have goals?	
17	getting out of bed 
8	I have dream goals and big goals and small goals and daily goals... Can't live without something to look forward to. Anticipation is my motivation.
2	No I dont hsve explicit goals because I'm scared to fail
2	I wish I did, but any goals I might have are pretty vague (which isn't very helpful). "Constant improvement" is my motto. The few goals I do have don't have a specific timeline or anything. 
1	I wish I did but I dont. If I took the myers briggs it would probably tell my why
2	ISFP authors and poets	When people bring up examples of real-life ISFPs, they're usually musicians, actors or visual artists. I think that people underestimate the creative writing potential of ISFPs. I would love to hear some examples of ISFP authors and poets, and your reasoning for them being ISFP. How can the unique strengths of the ISFP be applied to the written word?
4	While I cant off the top of my head give you an example of ISFP poets, I just wanted to throw this thought out there. For the longest time whenever I took an MBTI test and I hit on a question about enjoying poetry, I would select no because I don't generally read poetry. But then recently it occured to me that I love lyrics, and what are lyrics if not poetry set to music? I mean there are some songs out there that even without the music the words are a masterpiece all their own. \n\nSo anyway, the thought occured that maybe I do like poetry, and by the same token maybe you already know ISFP poets, we've just been looking at them the wrong way.\n\nJust something I've been mulling over.
1	It would be very difficult for me to tell.  \n  \nAlso interesting would just be, e.g. poets that would appeal especially to ISFPs. I don't know, but I'd guess it would be more about the lush mouth-feel and easily-conjurable imagery, than (for example) metaphysical poetry.
8	ISFP Cognitive Orientation Guidebook	
1	Are you an ISFP?
23	Do you get annoyed by people talking shit behind your back?	One of my closely held values is that I never speak badly about a person with another person because it feels insincere. Therefore I can't really understand why people do this to each other all the time. If someone starts shit-talking the other person I try to at least sympathize with them or explain to the person I'm talking with where they might be coming from. I certainly get annoyed when others do this to me. I know it's a bit ironic since I usually can't handle criticism (or more like I hold too much to my own viewpoint), but I'd usually rather people be direct to me. I usually understand things when they are said directly, and it actually feels like they're being respectful to me as a person. I know I can't avoid it, but when others are saying stuff behind my back and I find out about it, it makes me feel ignored as a person and very annoyed and disappointed that they would do this to me. Anyone else relate?
5	Yep, can relate. Even if they might be right I try to see both sides. Sometimes I catch myself thinking badly about a person for some reason and even then I try to understand them and kind of argue with myself. Hehe.
4	IT is the WORST crime imaginable!!\n\n\-me
3	Yes...it's pretty unfair to shittalk someone without them being there to defend themselves. I have a hard time trusting people who do this, because I suspect they don't have my back, either.
1	>but I'd usually rather people be direct to me. I usually understand things when they are said directly, and it actually feels like they're being respectful to me as a person.  \n  \nI haven't got too much to add - i try to just let people be.  \nBut when someone criticises me from a place of care, wanting the best for me, those are some of my favourite memories from my life.  \n  \nthey've tried to see my life with these changes, thought carefully about my predicaments. i'd never asked for anything like that, but it felt like such a gift.  \n  \nBut, I've heard people joke vindictively about my friends and i've wanted to tear their faces off.
1	Absolutely. I prefer to not say anything about someone behind their back that is untrue and/or something I wouldn't have the balls to say to their face. When I hear about people saying things behind my back that they wouldn't say to my face or that isn't true (and goes against my rules for myself) I get pissed and typically either confront them or just cut them out of my life entirely with no explanation to them.
7	Wanting to do things in your own time?	Sometimes it's a strength (when we are focused on a passion, and put other things aside to do it) but other times it doesn't help me, when I feel very slow.\n\nDo you find there is a balance between reminding yourself that some tasks are better done quickly and rejecting an externally-imposed fast pace?
7	At once, I think it's silly how people rush about, and yet, if I'm not careful 10 years have gone by.
2	I feel you 100%. I've gotten criticism all my life for doing things in my own time. I can't explain it other than "eventually it'll be accomplished" procrastination mentality. It's a little more focused when it's a passion project, but that's more about my creative methodology. As for the day to day minutiae, I set a vibrating timer on my watch for ten minutes dedicated solely to one activity, move on to a logical next task that I dedicate another ten minutes to and so forth five times, then take a ten minute "me time" break. I then start the rotation until tasks are done. It's a minimalist way for me to be type A for a bit. I just hate constant deadlines, and this works for me to chunk the bs into manageable amounts. My idea is we only have one life to live, the rushing nonsense is nonsense. 
11	Anyone else a borderline INFP?	I’m curious to know if anyone here took the personality test and got 51% sensing and 49% intuition. I’m constantly fluttering between the two personalities and don’t know exactly where I fit or if I even want to fit into one or the other. \n\nAny advice for someone with an indistinct letter in their MBTI?
6	Dude, yes! I used to be an INFP for yeaaars, everytime I did the test. About 4 months ago, I did the test again, and apparently I'm an ISFP now? So i assume I'm pretty 50/50 as well. I don't feel very ISFP though, not only because I used to identify as an INFP.
4	I pretty much always get infp on the tests i just feel like i relate better to the isfp functions. Also my sister is so intensely infp that i seem wayyy more isfp in comparison. Yeah i think infp and isfp are harder to tell apart and theres more to the isfp personality that the tests dont do justice. I think a lot of people relate to both or waver in between.
3	Me! I was actually just browsing this sub to see if I could find relatable ISFP posts. I was INFP for years, and I have recently started getting ISFP. My N and F have always been very close percentage wise. I feel like I relate to more INFP articles and such, but after knowing both INFPs and ISFPs in person, I definitely seem more like an ISFP. I wish there were more articles and things for people who fall in the middle of these two types--apparently it is fairly common. 
3	I get infp on the tests but I am more like an isfp in reality. Imaginative, dreamy, yeah somewhat, but I have some kind of inherent concreteness, sensuality, simplicity, and acceptance that's isfp-ish at heart.
1	Well since we have Ni and Se. We can see both sides.
14	Click this post to take a survey on sexuality comparisons among MB types. The survey's on sex, so it ranges from your views on sex to your preferences/kinks. Totally anonymous, all questions are optional. No essays. Only takes about 15 mins. I'll share the results :)	
2	Where will the results be shared? I’m curious!
1	Awwwww I missed out.
3	Where are you?	Hello from an ENTJ! I’ve managed to run into all the 16 types except you, so where am I likely to find you? \nWhere do you spend you time? \nWhat are your hobbies? \nDo you enjoy being outside? \nWhat subjects are you interested in?\n\nAny hints on how to spot an ISFP? 
10	You won’t find me... because I’m always at home 🙃
6	Personally I love outdoorsy stuff like backpacking and hiking. I’m told I have a chill presence so look for people like that. And people who notice beauty if that makes sense
2	Dyed hair usually. Rather mysterious or guarded. 
2	Crawled up in a bookshelf, hiding from the extroverts.
2	A pottery class. In my pottery class pretty much everyone was giving off isfp vibes. At my job now as an animal caretaker several of us are isfp. I pretty much only hang out at home and sometimes i go to a friends house so idk where we "go out to hang" or anything.
2	Just chipping in if it helps! I tend to catch up with close friends at coffee shops/restaurants (if not in their own home) but for me to feel like I’ve actually spent quality time with them, it’s usually with only one or two people at a time. \n\nIf I’m hanging out in a group of good friends, you can always find me cracking jokes or dissolving into fits of laughter. Making people laugh is also my go-to when I’m trying to make new people feel comfortable around me.\n\nI like trying new things and if it’s something I’m very interested in, then I don’t mind doing things on my own - eg: going to a photography/dance/writing class, going for a photo walk around town, etc. 
7	Too introverted to be ESFP, too extraverted to be ISFP	(And no I’m not ENFP)\n\nAny key traits that will help define the difference? Thx 
10	we’re all a rich tapestry
7	Introversion versus extraversion is a bit silly. All it really means is what we need to "re-charge", or how we gain energy. I feel like being an introvert doesn't mean you're a shy person, it just means that you need some personal time each day after expending all your energy with other people.
2	Look into the functions and how they affect behavior.\n\nAlso, introversion and extraversion are about how you recharge. You can have an extremely friendly and outgoing introvert, and you can have a shy, reserved extravert. It's about where you get your energy.\n\nI like being around people, but I find it exhausting, and need some alone time to process everything that happened and relax. That makes me an introvert.
1	I recommend taking a functions test.\n\nhttp://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html\n\n
1	This cracked me up, because I too, wonder the same.\n\nI 'm certainly and ISFP, but people call me extrovert most of the time.\n\nI also love to discuss things in depth, like an ENFP... I'm amazing, I know :)\n\nI think it's relatively simple to see.\n\nDo you feel normal about going out and talk to random strangers in the street, or talking to girls/guys you're interest in, or find attractive? Or would you probably cross the street if there is a bunch of girls/guys sitting on your path, and you feel a bit uncomfortable that they look at you?\n\nAre you more social, or more reserved?\n\nThat kind of answer will tell you who you are.\n\nAnyway, your questions is probably more along the lines of this:\n\n[https://www.talentinsights.com/blog/introverted-feeling-vs-extroverted-feeling/](https://www.talentinsights.com/blog/introverted-feeling-vs-extroverted-feeling/)
1	That's not really how it works. The E and I aren't saying that a person is introverted or extroverted. It's simply saying that the person's dominant function is introverted or extroverted (ISFP - Introverted Feeling is the dominant function, ESFP - Extroverted Sensing is dominant). You can be an ISFP and be an extrovert or be an ESFP and be introverted.

2	What is your profession?	...and do you feel that you're in the right field, being an ISFP? 
3	Waiter/Bartender. I hate people sometimes but I’m just so good at dealing with them. 
2	I'm a graphic designer, and I honestly have no idea. Some days I absolutely love my job, and other days I loathe it and don't feel cut out for it. Some days I wish I did something with more variety and flexibility. Some days I wish I was doing something more hands on.
2	HA-OOH! HA-OOH! HA-OOH!\n\nSorry
2	Pharmacist. And yes, most days.
1	Pilot
1	I work in a restaurant and an idiosyncratic kids' museum but I want to do research for non-profit organizations
1	I worked in counterterrorism, but I recently left that field cause it became too much. Constantly dealing with incredibly graphic content and just constantly being exposed to how dark humanity can be. \n\nI'm now unemployed with interviews lined up. \n\nSo, to answer your question, no, I was not in the right field. I wish to find a field where I can put my previous work behind me and do something more fun and hands-on. 
1	I went to school for fashion design, and now i’m working in graphic design/marketing. \n\nI spend a lot of time wishing i was a dancer, but I’m also excellent at interior decorating. I could probably be happy in any creative field if i didn’t have to constantly appease clients’ tastes and desires.
1	Line cook\n\nNo hahaha I hate it. \nThis is also just one thing in a long string of completely different jobs, and I have no idea how long it's going to last. 
8	What colors are inspiring you right now?	Mine are:\n\n1. A soft orange red, like a red sunset or salt lamp \n2. The emerald greens of maple trees, preferably two shades together for depth\n3. The light yellow before the golden hour hits, which is about the shade of very old paper\n4. Brownish black\n5. Cobalt
3	1. Purple/Violet (has always been my favorite color) \n2. Pink\n3. Turquoise/Aquamarine (like clear lake/sea water) \n4. Bright green
2	Similar to your cobalt, i'm liking the twilighty blues/blacks/purples lately. they feel like dreams. normally i'm more autumnal. i think it's so warm and bright now, everything's too clear. i like the incoherence.  \n[max](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fd/ad/61/fdad61b9bfc0cd3837d131d596cdbbca.jpg)  [max](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/41/a4/08/41a40826277ae353011f9a4b4c56762b.jpg)  [max](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9a/3a/e6/9a3ae6651fad0f0ed4eb0fe95f39fd63.jpg)  [pic](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/cb/e2/2b/cbe22bdd8d2cb2f7c70953b81fd8956b.jpg)  [miro](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fb/5b/8b/fb5b8bec2b008df7ded845d051ce2715.jpg)  [richter](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/be/ea/c9/beeac9cdaa6b131df693af9ae10d23cd.jpg)  [Lempicka](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/dd/75/07/dd7507d2cbba9fb99e51be706b10e795.jpg)

2	Academic Survey	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
1	Heyyy.... during the Likert section from question 44 on, I am able to respond "0" even though the instructions are for 1 - 9\n\nAlso the page with the "7." at the top has funky directions
14	MBTI-themed Discord server	 Hello, dear ISFPs, Cognition is an MBTI server with a focus on intellectual conversation, i.e. science and philosophy as well as feel support in terms of personal growth, relationship advice as well as just plain venting in case you need it. We also have some artsy channels and a frequently used selfie channel should you feel confident enough to show yourselves (or your surroundings) :P We could use a few more ISFPs, so we'd be more than happy to welcome you to our server.\n\n[https://discord.gg/yHZn6Ap](https://discord.gg/yHZn6Ap)
10	Social Comparison?	I am a student in college and this summer has been happy because I am not around thousands of other students and subconsciously comparing myself to them.\n\nI want to continue to live my life story and stay focused on that. Do you have any tips for marching to the beat of your own drum and for noticing others less?  
3	Yeah this is quite a tough one.. I would say do something different. Something that you would be proud of yourself for doing. I was an exchange student for a year and now I'm going into college knowing that I have some type of an upper hand. Cultural awareness, language skills, memories/experiences. People say to me "wow that's really cool!" and it makes me feel like I've accomplished a lot.\nIt's also good to remember that everyone else also compares themselves to each other. 
2	Get comfortable in your own skin, then others will stop mattering. Make sure you take care of yourself, maybe buy a lotion you really like the smell of or get a nice haircut or new clothes. That way you’ll feel like the shit, making everyone else fade away a bit. 
17	Do you like expressing yourself through clothing?	Ive read isfp descriptions that say we are into clothes and style. Are you? What are some of your favorite clothes right now? Whats your style like?\n\nIm kinda into clothes. I like looking a little scrappy. I like hippy stuff but not in your face hippy stuff. My favorite clothes are my kikkoman soysauce t shirt and my denim joggers. Hbu?
7	Okay so now we know how to differentiate between ISFPs and INFPs. You guys are walking around in beautiful expressive clothing, we are walking around in grocery bags.
3	Yep. I wear lolita fashion with colorful and bright patterns, it makes me feel like my best self. \n\nIf I have a lazy day I might prefer to wear a tshirt of my favorite fandoms. \n\nI cant stand others trying to choose clothes for me especially if those clothes are mature and athletic. I must choose them myself, I have very specific and sensitive tastes in things like clothes and art. \n\nA few years ago though I didnt give a shit about clothes and just let my mom choose them for me. Now I have some new ones they made me realized how meeeeeh those old ones were
2	Yes! I love my denim jackets and loafers. I have multiples of both. 
2	I like expressive accessories and accent pieces but wear plain clothes.
2	May I politely and unjudgingly ask how many here are positively inclined towards the hippy lifestyle and/or would like to test it. \n\nAlso who draws inspiration in clothing from this movement?\n\nI'm asking because one if the things that was repeatedly mentioned in type descriptions I have read was that were I to imagine an ISFP I just have to imagine Hippies.\n\nMy mom and an ex are ISFP and both of them are in some form of fashion intrigued by it.
1	Yesss I live for dressing up to just make myself feel fabulous! I can mix and match anything and make it my own. Lately it's been more edgy and all black. I am also into shirts with a choker and deep v :)
1	Yes it’s probably the main way i express myself 
1	Yes! I love winter clothes, specially my gabardine, white wool jersey and scarf. \n\nAlso, I don't know if it's considered clothing, but I always make a topknot in my hair, and let two hair wicks free, anime style.
1	Thinking about clothes (and designing some of them in my head) is pretty fun. I like jeans with pretty much everything. One of my favorite attires is jeans with a black skin-tight lace shirt and black ankle boots. I'd wear them everywhere. I also like my lavender v-neck shirt and purple knee-length pants for casual attire. 
1	Given the choice, I'd wear clothes to express my ideal identity. With lack of options/money, I tend to take what I can get that most appeals to me and that kinda becomes my temporary identity. The clothes I wear definitely affect my mood and self-perception.\n\nFor my ideal identity, I imagine myself as I would appear as a cartoon character (my friends have literally compared me to a cartoon haha). [Kinda what it would look like](https://i.imgur.com/XSAHpfo.png) is a red hoodie/jacket, yellow polo shirt, blue/grey jeans, and whatever colour sneakers I feel like at the time. Sunglasses too if I want to feel extra cool B\^J
1	I like button-downs with swirly patterns on them, and I'm a slut for jewelry. though I don't wear it that often cause stupid gender roles.
3	If you had to choose, would you rather be blind or deaf? Why?	
12	Deaf, words can't hurt if I can't hear you. Also if somebody would like to talk with me, they'll need to learn sign language, so I guess the person that does that really loves me.
6	I would say deaf because sight is more important, in terms of a more comfortable lifestyle. Although when looking back on the things I'd be giving up it hurts. Music is so important to me... But a sacrifice is a sacrifice.
2	Deaf. Sight would take away most sports; I'd be miserable. 
2	Blind. I love nature sounds and music. Music is feeling for me. I could listen to podcasts to entertain myself. 
2	Deaf, would save me from my music addiction.
1	deaf
5	Introvert =/= shy and Extravert =/= initiating conversations??	(Please don’t get me wrong. I’m not trying to make this into a type me thread. These are just examples on how I’ve identified with both types and how I don’t fit some of the extravert traits, hopefully helping clear up the whole “are you shy or outgoing?” sterotypes.)\n\nOk. I’ve identified as ESFP for a long time now. But lately I’ve been confusing with ISFP because quite honestly, I don’t: \n\n- “Hurr durr manipulate and control the environment and people.” I would rather just go with the flow rather than ‘push my own agenda.’  Unless something is really super important to me, I’m not forcing anything.\n\n- I don’t ever really take the ‘lead.’ I’d rather let someone else more confident do it. I really hate bossing people around.\n\n- I don’t know if this is whether I’m shy or was actually an introvert this entire time but: I can’t bring myself to initiate conversations. I might be standing in line, or sitting next to someone on the bus, and as much as I would like to make a friend I’m just too pussy to actually say hi or talk to them. And it’s also very painful if I do somehow muster up the guts to say hi and they don’t even hear me. I just think: well damn I’d be less uncomfortable just keeping my face in my phone. Now if *they* start the conversation, that’s a different story. I’d be more than happy to talk with them for hours and hours. I don’t even mind small talk. But the point I’m trying to make here is *I can’t initiate a conversation for the life of me!*\n\n- I’m rarely the “life of the party.” I don’t *mind* being the center of attention, but I’m not constantly trying to throw myself out there. If I speak up and everyone listens, omg cool! But I’m never trying to force myself in the spotlight 24/7. I kind of rely on someone else to get the group all fired up. If you put me in a dead, cold silent room with people who seem depressed or uninterested in conversation, I’m not going to be the typical ESFP that “lights everything up with my presence” and makes things lively. Like I said, I sort of just go with it. I’d rather it be more fun but I’m not the kind of person who would cause that.\n\n- One of my friends actually thought I was an introvert (reference to point 3) because I was acting shy when I first met her. I sat next to her because I sort of wanted to talk to her, but I couldn’t actually talk to her. She was actually surprised I was typed ESFP because of that. \n\n**Although**, I’ve never questioned my love to be around people. Even though I don’t initiate conversations or rile everybody up, I still would never turn down a social gathering. I would sooo rather go to a dinner party with lots of people at a resteraunt than stay home and read a book. Just the thought of that makes me excited.\n\nI relate to a ton of the ESFP traits but not every single one. I also relate to a few ISFP traits too, but I honestly just feel like ESFP is the best fit for me. \n\nSo to conclude, it is still possible to be a shy “E” or an outgoing “I,” otherwise I wouldn’t know *what* to do. \n\nThanks so much for taking the time to read this, I really hope this was helpful.\n\n^originally ^posted ^in ^rmbti\n\n
6	I've always identified as being an Introvert, until I met my boyfriend who I thought was a really outgoing extrovert... let me ask you what are your energy levels after spending time with people? Are you deflated and want time alone to repair/ de-stress? Or are you almost unchanged/ even more energized? I've always just assumed I was introverted because I kept to myself, and my boyfriend extroverted because he can hold a strong conversation with almost anyone and everyone. However it comes down to the energy levels.\nI hate being alone, and I always seem to be alone, but when I'm with others I feel comfort in being with them, even though I will happily avoid unknown social situations/ get awkward if I am involved in them. But I'm not drained at all, not even in the slightest. Where as my boyfriend who can talk the legs off a donkey if he wants to, really seriously gets overwhelmed by the end of it and really craves the alone time. \n\nAn example which sort of solidified it for me... we've been together for 5 years, and always been around each other and our families... and we get along really well with each others family like a house on fire. However I started to notice whilst I would always be around either chatting with my parents or his parents, he whilst being heavily involved in the conversation for quite some time, would slowly slink off to a room and start doing his own thing. I used to get sooo MAD at him, like stop being rude and come and talk. But despite many conversations regarding the matter, and him saying he would improve and whilst he did a little, at the end of the day I'd still find him off on his own having crept away. And It just didn't make sense why he kept going and practically hiding...until I started to think what if I'm just a shy extrovert, and he's an outgoing introvert, and that suddenly explained everything.\n\nThe real question is though so I identify as Introvert/ambiverted/or extroverted? I'd say yes I'm just an awkward extrovert with introverted tendencies because of my social anxiety. And because of that I can relate more to the introverted tendencies identified in the MBTI. I doubt this has made things clearer for you but maybe give you something to think about?\n\nTl/dr - there is such a thing as an outgoing introvert and a shy extrovert. 
3	Do you like animated "adult"/drama movies? Like "Loving Vincent" or "Sita Sings the Blues"? Any recommendations?	Do you find yourself liking stylistic movies which are thought-provoking, but you don't mind if they lack a good plot?
3	Persepolis is one of my favourites.
3	Breadwinner, Song of the Sea, Secret of Kells
3	Anomalisa and Isle of Dogs are some really good recent ones! 
2	Yes!!! My recommendations are, Paprika, tokyo godfathers, chico and rita, wrinkles, millennium actress, the triplets of belleville, waking life, and steam boy off the top of my head. They are all very different but all very good.
2	The Man Who Planted Trees (prolly on youtube)  \nOnly Yesterday - protag might be an isfp - hadn't thought about her type before.  \n  \nmight not be what you're after but Yuriy Norshteyn's shorts are lovely.
2	>Do you find yourself liking stylistic movies which are thought-provoking, but you don't mind if they lack a good plot?  \n  \nSorry, must have glossed over this. But, yeah! Like getting lost in a Matisse still-life even though I'm not overly concerned with lemons.  \n  \nOr listening to Coltrane without thinking too heavily about *The Sound of Music*.
2	*The Illusionist* (2010 dir. Sylvia Chomet) made me cry so freaking hard but it's a great story with extremely minimal dialogue (all in French, but it's not necessary for comprehending the story)
12	I feel like being fi dominant is a handicap	Like. Other types are more able to be uncomfortable emotionally and therefore can get into situations that could be difficult but good for them allowing them to grow as people. But as an isfp first and foremost prioritizing my own feelings it seems like that causes me to want to be comfortable most of the time so i dont like getting out of my comfort zone. and also because my feelings are taking up so much space in my attention other functions are stunted.  I wish i was an enfp or something :( im always using Fi HARD, man. Seems like it drowns out anything else. Plus Fi is so basic. Every one has feelings. Theyre the most basic fucking thing. Babies have feelings and nothing else pretty much. Have i really not learned to go off of anything past my own personal feelings since infant hood? I feel like Fi dominance especially as an isfp is the dumbest function ever :( 
14	[deleted]
7	I know that feeling, I have a feeling Fi isn't valued by society overall. But also, I think others could benefit from having more Fi and I think us Fi-dominants have something that others don't. Think of Fi as giving you a solid identity. Because of that stable identity and self-knowledge, we deal with considerably less amount of problems that other people have to deal with. We have a head start in knowing what is good for ourselves, what we want to deal with and how to avoid things that we don't want to. Actually, it's not that us Fi-dominants have more struggles (more struggles adapting to society maybe), but *different* struggles. Yes, we might have problems moving out of our comfort zone, but we also don't deal with constant lack of boundaries or social insecurities and whatnot other feeler types might have. I think it's actually pretty lucky to be an ISFP, you just have to look at the other side of things a bit.
5	Your auxiliary function will help you if you think you are too stuck in your Fi. You are selling Fi short because it has important values to the world. You just need to figure that out for yourself.  It's not just feelings, it's more than that. 
5	INFP here.  \n\neverything is a handicap. my friend is a marine.  he has learned to "control" his feelings and empathy, he says.  then when his wife gets mad that he takes her to a place she said she didn't want to go to eat, he says "I don't know what her problem is."  He then gets mad at her for not talking at dinner because she is in this place she plainly told him she did not want to have dinner at.  Having not enough emotions and empathy is just as bad as having too much emotions and empathy.  \n\nI am very strong at abstract stuff, so I can learn very difficult concepts with ease.  The other end of that is I suck at details so I can read something 10 times and not remember the names, dates, details.  Every strength is a weakness...and vice versa...  \n\nSo learn the strengths of Fi dominance (strong value system, passion, motivation, helping people, empathy, understanding people deeply, love of art, self-knowledge, authenticity, honesty, integrity, self-reliance, independence) and work on reigning in the things it sucks at (being hypercritical when someone annoys you, hypersensitive, mood swingy, depressed, ruminating, apathetic to things that don't inspire you, etc)
3	Same, being an ISTP or ESTP would be the most convenient, I think.
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/infp] [Infps what do you think about this post i made about being fi dominant (especially as an isfp)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/8v00jd/infps_what_do_you_think_about_this_post_i_made/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	I’m def Fi dom and Ne in how i gather input from the outside world. Over the years i’ve gathered enough data and experience where now I trust my Fi hard.  I’ve said in other posts i consider it like my “spider sense”. It is a bit rudimentary as it is this general good/bad feeling about ppl/places/decisions etc.  this happens extremely fast as it is wired to a more primordial part of my psyche—a reflex, instinct.  While i’ve learned to heed that what i’m trying to develop more is to not to let it trigger an emotion such as fear/excitement/sadness and analyze it more with my Ti to understand the why. Fi is not just feelings or emotions. Maybe your Se is how you percieve the world all the time so too much stimuli will be too intense and thus you feel a need to control it and so follow predictable and go to places you already know? Even if Fi dom you have everything else, its just about preferences
8	Hey less artistic ISFPs, do you view another hobby or your career as "art"?	Sometimes when I am writing or reading for my career or even exercising in nature, I am both seriously and creatively engaged. Is there something besides music, traditional art modes, or writing that you approach as if it's "art"?
8	Photography... but maybe that counts as a traditional art mode. Just being me is an art in itself 💁🏼‍♂️
3	Just to give a little spark to this because I like the idea: maybe partying is seen by many here as a way of artful (?) expression? Maybe even sex? Maybe cooking? Computer games?\n\nI know I'm not an ISFP but I have some high Fi too and when I used to solely play computer games I would use every possibility I had to be creative. Like implementing subtle jokes/rhymes/alliterations into serious tests. I don't know how related this is but hey, it's up to you to judge.
3	Music.\n\n\nDon't really mean hip-hop/rap music. I'm more of a blues fan. The delta blues really do ring in my ears.
2	I dont have any artistic hobies :/\n\nBut i love playing video games specifically in the RTS genre and i like getting my body fit if i dont get lazy :/
2	I really really really realy really really really loooove reading and writing and research. Also, I am taking up a music degree so yeah 
2	I used make fancy graphics and gifsets for shows/manga/movies I loved. I was once pretty decent at it, too. I cheated and followed tutorials to a t, though, but hey... still required some thinking.\n\nTotally forgot how to use photoshop though since I haven’t made any in a couple of years.\n\nI guess graphics count as art, though?
7	What are some of your favorite things decorating your space right now?	I have a tapestry on my desk with green, blue, purple, and lavender in a mandala pattern -  it's nice :) Also, I have some meaningful pictures and albums to the side.\n\nWhich of your decorations put you in a favorite mood?
7	I have a photo of my mom with this cute little elephant figurine she gave me. I also have a nice succulent sitting next to it. \n\nIt's nice to have a photo of her in a place I know I won't cry, lol. 
4	I wouldn't say it puts me in my favorite mood but I just got my first blackout curtains for my room. I spent two hours picking them out and they really fit well in my room. The really help with noise and naps.
2	I have a shadowboxed Sam Mills jersey with a signed photo of him above my couch. Even if you're not a football fan, his story is amazing and he created an identity for a young team. KEEP POUNDING! 
2	I have a nice lamp with soothing light and a small statue of sleeping budha on my bedside table. This really gets me in a calm and peaceful mood.\nGot a few posters of my favourite book covers and quotes on the wall infront of my bed as well.
2	https://i.imgur.com/GevGwn8.jpg
2	Well this is basic but my twinkle lights of course and also this shell wind chime? Hangy thingy? idk what you call it. Any way its made out of shells strung together and you hang it up. I got it from a teeny tiny thrift shop on the island of saint kitts in the Caribbean. Its the only souvenir i got on the trip and its my favorite thing in my room. 
13	Motivation and hobbies	I can be very arty; enjoy photography, cross stitch, making sentimental gifts for friends and family, listening to music, photoshopping, painting, print making, pottery, colouring in etc. But most of the time I lack motivation to do any of it, or start and never finish because I seen to get bored by it... any one else? Please tell me I'm not as shitty at being an ISFP as I think,and that there are more out there like me!
14	This sounds exactly like me. \n\nI have interest in 1 million things, but a passion for none. 
6	You are not shitty at being ISFP, but ISFP could struggle to describe you. You are good at being you, someone we all need.\n\nI do this too.\n\nI like to pick three or so projects/ hobbies for the month and alternate them or choose the most desirable one when I am deciding what to do. Narrowing down your options gives you a chance to pick what best expresses your values at the current time and makes it more likely that you'll go farther on each individual project. Plus, remember that art is never really finished.
20	Do you like to look at urban nature as you walk by? Like squirrels, birds, trees, planted flowers...	
15	Yes, it would be weird not to
6	I stare at beautifulness everytime I have a chance.\n\nEdit: ~~This sounded less cringey in my head lol~~
6	I constantly get distracted by flowers and plants. I climb trees too.
5	Hell yes. I talk and wave to animals as I walk past.
3	Hate the idea of urban nature... actually just hate the idea of urban... would rather nature on its own without shitty buildings, and cars polluting everything, and people focused on work with their tunnel visions. 
2	Not until I was about 19. I used to go for a 2-3 hour walk, through the town, along the beach, etc. passed many people during the day, without really registering them, or anything else. Couldn't tell you if I'd passed an attractive woman, a well-dressed man; if a car had honked its horn, if a bird had sang.   \n\n  \nThen, everything flipped. I'm absorbing all of my environment constantly. When it rains, I can feel the ground all around me.
2	Absolutely! I honestly don't get truly bored super often because I can just become super absorbed in my surroundings. I think the most stereotypical thing I have ever done was when I was playing a piece of music on the piano for my friend, before looking up and out the window, seeing a rabbit, and immediately leaving my piano to go outside and fine the bunny lol. I honestly have a really difficult time focusing often because I'm constantly just in my own little world (not like I constantly daydream or anything, but I'll just be focusing on small details like birds singing or the colors in flowers and the little minuscule details in tree bark, etc. if that makes any sense?)
8	Do you unconsciously adapt to people?	I ask this because I do this and I feel like ISFPs are prone to do this. 
15	Ooooooh yes! I have my "me" personality and I'll never shy away from that, but I definitely find myself altering the things I say or my actions based on what I know the other person will respond to best. 
8	I definitely think so! It's like a sign of our opposing Fe, right? There's definitely a sense of accommodating to what others want socially, especially in the beginning stages of getting to know that person. Unfortunately, I feel like it can get us in trouble because we might not be the best at it/end up repressing how we feel or what we want out of the social interaction or relationship with that person.
8	Yes! It’s the empathy and trying to make everyone feel comfortable 
3	One of the reasons for so long I've though I was an INFJ. 
1	Physical mirroring and cognitive empathy, yes; changing my personality, no.
7	Which types do you like and dislike and why?	Saw your sub and wanted to breath some life into it, anyways I'll start.\n\nI'll keep it short and simple.\n\nMy type: ENTJ\n\nFavorite type: INTP, I don't know where to start, from my experience with the few that I know, they tend to keep to themselves but if you let someone with this type actually open up to you and connect, they can be some of the most hilarious or interesting type people to have a one on one conversation with at 2 am, like they will think up the craziest things, and I'll think up how to actually make those things happen. Plus they are walking libraries, my cousin is one and his favorite hobby is legit learning things, whatever it may be, but when it comes to social interactions they can be so awkward in the cutest ways, anyways I think they can hold some of the most interesting conversations, just wish they would put more into action.\n\nLeast favorite type: ISTJ, never really knew any on a personal level, I think I just naturally don't get along with them, but I've worked with a few and it just annoys me how by the books they can be, like if there's a way to do something better, if I put it into action and actually yield more efficient/better results, they will still completely be against it. Honestly I like most people and can't really think of much negative things to say, what I do like about them however, is how serious they can commit to their work or passions, even if we don't see eye to eye I can totally respect that.\n\nAlso I did not keep this short and simple, oops. Also I want to connect with isfps better, feel free to tell me about yourselves and what you like about entjs :D\n\nP.S. Let's make this sub great.
6	Aw, I don't feel like anyone should dislike another person because of their type, but I guess when it comes to ease of making friends/building a relationship I've noticed a few trends.\n\nMy type: ISFP\n\nEasiest type to make friends with: xNTx. You all are very intellectual, fascinating to talk to, and the way you blend a visionary outlook and logical thinking is pretty incredible (and different than me, which is why I gravitate towards you all). My roommate in college this year is an ENTJ, and I'm always in awe at how naturally he takes on roles of leadership and can answer random questions and organize his environment well. He's very into stress reduction, so our apartment is decked out with essential oils, a salt lamp, etc. I guess it must be the whole opposites attract thing (although I have found myself in awe of other ISFP's with different artistic talents than mine, like Britney Spears with her dancing back in the day). The seriousness with which y'all take life is pretty adorable as well (in the BEST way!)\n\nHardest type to make friends with: ESTP, ESFJ, xSTJ. I don't have much of a problem with xNFx (albeit the cultish, SJW vibe I get from xNFJs and xNFPs I know at school that makes prolonged friendship strained and difficult). In my experience, ESTPs tend to stick around for literally a second as your friend, and then move on to the next interesting stimulus at their convenience. Se is wonderful and powerful, but I couldn't imagine living life with that little of an ability to "stick" around. ESFJs, hilarious and magnetic as they are, just don't come across to me as genuine people most of the time, and I always feel lowkey judged and/or tested talking to the ones I know. Sometimes it seems like anytime I talk to one, they speak as if they're addressing a whole crowd of people even if it's just me. And then xSTJ, I think it's just a matter of them holding on SO tightly to tradition that there's literally nothing I can debate them about. They also kind of tend to obsess over one topic (leadership, politics) and talk about it NONSTOP, which you can only pretend to be interested in for so long...\n\nBut anyways! That was surprisingly fun, thank you for that idea :)
6	> Least favorite type: ISTJ, never really knew any on a personal level\n\nStopped reading after this. This is why people hate MBTI.
2	ENFP - fake
2	I admire ExxJs in general. I like how they are life teachers, and I can always learn something from all of them. But I don't hate a particular type. If I had to choose it would be unhealthy IxFPs (yes I include my type). I also don't like how the INFJ sub turned like... but I know one IRL that's a sweetie.
2	I admire INTP and INTJ (burned by a manipulative person once - ex) for their smarts and INFJ (present gf) for their compassion. Less admiration towards ISTJ because of their above all and judgemental attitude. Though they have proved to be great friends in need.
1	My type: isfp\n\nTypes i feel most comfortable around:\nIsfp, isfj, infp, infj,enfp, esfp istp\n\nI guess mostly introverted feelers. Introverted because i just feel more comfortable with their vibes and feeling because i tend to feel intimidated by more thinking dominated types. I like chiller folks. \n\nTypes i admire but never get along with: entj, entp, intp, estj, enfj intj\n\nI pretty much suck at befriending extroverts. I cant keep up with all the talking and the hanging out they need. These folks always seem less chill and i like being around calm quiet people like me. Im also intimidated by their smarts and always astounded at how intensely they believe in their own opinions. Like, i dont assign very much value to my own opinions im always assuming im probably wrong about things. Idk even if i disagree with things they say i wouldnt be able to discuss stuff with them because their inner voices are just stronger. \n\nAn exception to the intj thing is my boyfriend who is very compassionate and tender hearted and emotional for an intj. Still quite an intj though. We get along but others ive met have been too abrasive for me.
1	my type: ISFP \n\ni make good close acquaintances with ESFPs but whenever we start getting any close we tend to rub each other the wrong way at some point.\n\ni Hate that whenever they get angry at you they try to burn down the entire bridge and other vindictive activities. \n\nI love being friends with INFPs because we always tend to understand each other well because we share the F function and the P function really well.\n\nxNTX- are a really nice experience to be listen to and sometimes even be friends. \n\nINTJs- make good ranters  and are chill people who don't usually put up other with peoples crap which is admirable. \n\nENTJs- are a very arrogant ,stubborn bunch but they also tend to be charismatic and efficient. though i also make good friends with them they can be real assholes especially when they get angry.\n\nENTP-  are very fun people to be  around but i don't like it when they get angry because throw every vulnerable thing they know about you and turn it into words. but i actually really like being around them because they are very kind and fun people to be around. \n\nI think i would get along with other ISFPs but i would not want it because it would feel be like being around myself.
3	Can someone please explain the difference between Dom Fi and Aux Fi?	I’m trying to figure out if I’m esfp or isfp.\n\nThank you!
2	Basically how I see it is Fi doms strive for internal harmony at all times. Analyze things and people around themselves to see how they relate to themselves. \n\nAux Fi makes decisions based on internal harmony, but first it wants to take in the information outside (through Se or Ne, in your case Se).
1	https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/
1	Dom Fi is more apparent in ISFPs than in ESFPs. When the function is in the aux, there is a tendency for the user to skip it entirely, and fall on the third function instead, it being more comfortable than the aux function. So an ESFP is just as likely to show Te as Fi, so their Fi is more diluted compared to ISFPs, who use their Fi ALL. THE. TIME.
5	How long does an ISFP(M) take to get over someone?	My ISFP friend [18M] broke up with his girlfriend [18F] 5 months ago, mainly due to religious differences. He was the one who confessed to her and was eventually broken up with, so he's obviously heartbroken.\n\nHe takes a lot of quiet time to think about life (emo) every night, which is understandable, but I'm not sure when this is too much. By that, I mean being sad too much of the time and it becoming psychologically unhealthy.\n\nHe gets reminded very easily by his ex, for example, we were talking about our idols/celebrities and he mentioned that his ex met a certain celebrity before, even though we weren't talking about this certain celebrity at all.\nHe also won't go to places where he and his ex has had memories together (understandable, but that's a lot of places).\n\nBasically, she is still on his mind all the time. I've tried to give a little advice on some things that might help, but he tells me that they'll never work and he's gonna be stuck in this emotional state forever.\n\nHe's pretty self-aware that he's sad a lot and kind of jokes about it (like when I said "tell me when you're sad", he replied "that's my secret, I'm always sad") or saying things like "being sad sucks", "life sucks", etc. I think all these are pretty normal reactions to a break up, but at the same time, it's been 5 months and I'm wondering if that's a little too long to be majorly upset ALL the time.\n\nWe hang out sometimes, but mostly communicate through text. He's really a great friend overall and will listen to my rants any time. I'm just really worried for his wellbeing and I wish he has more hope to move forward in life.\n\nAny tips on what I can say/do to help?\n\nTLDR: My ISFP friend [18M] broke up with his girlfriend 5 months ago. He is:\n- in a constant state of sadness\n- always mentions there's no hope in life\n- believes that he'll never be able to get over her because he liked her a lot.\n\nI'm afraid for his wellbeing and will appreciate some advice :)
5	Umm... ISFP(M) here, I guess it depends. For an ISFP, his behavior is kind of alarming because I think being in the FiNi loop (a destructive thinking pattern as a reaction to stress) can be pretty dangerous. It leads to a lot of self-compromising thinking/behaviors. I personally know for a fact that when I'm in this loop, my quality of life plummets into the ground and I have to FORCE myself to go on some nature walks or exercise or dance or paint or whatever to get out of it asap.\n\nIt's clear that the breakup was hard on him, and that's really sad, because Fi-doms tend to feel these negative emotions more intensely and seemingly longer than any other type. I would suggest you encourage him to do things that engage his Se (and maybe join him, but more as a social presence than anything else) and see how he responds. Best of luck to you and your friend though!!!!!! <3 
4	I recently ended a relationship! I was quite sad for a while but a few things that helped me were \n1) I made a list of the reasons why we did not work out together. This included qualities I didn’t particularly like, fundamental differences, and memories of times when we clashed. \n2) I made a list of the ways I was held back in the relationship and what/who I could be on my own. \n3) I reminded myself of awesome the world is often. Even if I hated the world, I’d find some measure of beauty to focus on. \n4) I surrendered to fate. I told myself that these were necessary chapters in life that I needed to fulfill and they would lead me somewhere awesome. \n5) I got out and did something active and challenging on my own. I flew to the Grand Canyon and I hiked that bitch in one day. It took 12 hours (8 hours of straight hiking) and it was the hardest thing I had ever done. I felt immensely proud of myself afterwards. I spent the entire journey processing my emotions and practicing self-soothing. This trip was a significant part of my healing. For whatever reason, I ended up depending on my partner too much and it was like I forgot how to adventure on my own. This reminded me that I’m quite capable and strong and how much fun it is to have your own agenda and do things you want to do when you want to do them!!!\n6) listened to new music\n7) lots of exercise wth new music\n8) I spent more time outside. If I wanted to read, I’d do it in a park instead of staying inside. \n9) I took up drawing and painting\n10) I spent lots of time with friends and family.\n11) I actually started journaling. It was very helpful to get thoughts out. \n12) I practiced mindfulness and meditation. On days I couldn’t meditate, I’d make sure to do more mindful mundane activities like mindful hand washing or mindful cooking.\n13) I walked a lot biked around in different areas that were unfamiliar to me. \n\nI think getting in touch with your emotions and reining them in is very important. It’s so easy to get into a pessimistic loop of doom so it’s important to take control of your feelings and rewrire your thought patterns. I also think adding variety to you day is equally important. It reminds you how interesting the world is and how lucky you are that you have the rest of your life to see and experience neat and different things. 
2	(ISFP (F, tho)) My first relationship lasted less than a year and ended in a very, very messy way. It wasn't the only thing I was dealing with at the time, but it took me maybe 2 years to pull out of that funk.\n\nThat said, it's probably one of the best things that's happened to me. It got me going to the gym regularly (and eating better because of that), and I fell in love with kendo instead. Any sort of physical activity is great, because you can't be effective if you're not 100% there in the moment.\n\nWriting a lot also helped...anything to help give form to the blob of feelings that seemed to envelop me. Also lots of karaoke. Nothing comforts like other people's heartbreak.\n\nI think it's also important to nurture a balanced perspective. By all means, feel the emotions as they come. But when I missed the guy, it helped to remind myself that things ended for a reason, and of the things that weren't so great about the person/relationship. And when I got spiteful, it helped to remember the good things about it too -- we got together for a reason after all. I don't know if taking this approach prolonged the moving on process,  but I've seen too many friends use resentment towards the other person as a means to ride out the heartbreak period. They get back to acting normal very quickly, but whenever their ex comes up, it's clear things are still quite raw for them. I didn't want that for myself.\n\nHm, I wrote a lot. I don't know if this is applicable to your friend at all, but that's my $0.02 for ya.
1	Time, maybe more time than the average person. I dated someone 2 years, took me 1 year to stop thinking about them constantly.
1	If he’s anything like me it took me 1/2 the time I was with my gf to get over her. Then i was able to completely forget about her.
1	forever. 
9	Would be cool if you talked more	1) why should I prove myself to you?\n2) I don't have much else to say\n\nAn ESTP was giving me this advice a few months ago and it stuck. I would like to improve but I'm not making much progress. In fact I've probably regressed.\nDo you people have similar problems?\n\nEDIT: added more context
13	I would say I have this problem. I never know what to say so sometimes I will find something in my environment to comment on and tell a story that relates to it or ask a question that relates. Sometimes I find puns or play with words or make I jokes if I feel like I have to say something. Meaningless conversations are rather draining though. \n\nI’ve noticed that sometimes some of the things more extroverted people say isn’t really important. Like I could live a long and happy life without ever knowing that they are getting their hair done or that they went to the bank and forgot something at home and had to go back to bank after driving home. I find it hard to just say things that don’t really have a purpose. Conversations for me are only stimulating when there is an intellectual exchange between perspectives about experiences or ideas or opinions or emotions. If I’m confortable with the person, conversation always flows naturally though and it can just be about random things. \n\n
7	This would be like me telling someone to take up the violin, so we could jam together. *How does next week sound*?
4	"would be cool is you talked more" is very vague. Do they want small talk? Or do they want a plethora of detailed and deep conversations from the depths of your mind? I would prefer the later. If they are your friends then they should understand that our personality type really doesn't like to start small talk. The only exception really is when we are curious about others and ask them engaging questions that are just above "small talk" but not as stupid as anything involving weather. \n\nUnderstand that if you aren't interested in talking to your friends (or the people you hang out with) about topics that interest you, then you either need to start conversations yourself out of your own curiosity or just listen to others pov's and share insight. \n\nI had this problem a lot in highschool and therefore I didn't make many friends. I had one true friend that I connected with and that was it. Fast forward three years and I have a beautiful gf that's a INFP and I don't hesitate to tell her everything and we both are equally engaged in pretty much every conversation we have. \n\nThe harsh reality about being a ISFP is that you really only can have two or three true friends while everyone else typically stays off your radar. The key is not making enemies out of anyone, at all. Do yourself a favor and let this stick instead of some vague comment about your lack of conversation.\n\n Hope this helps!
2	I guess they probably find you interesting but are unsure how to connect? Generally when people say something like "you should smile/talk/to out more" my reaction is to say "you should talk less maybe instead?" \n\nI spent awhile when I was younger trying too hard to be outgoing and extroverted and it didn't do me any good. I would suggest saving yourself the trouble and doing what you feel comfortable with.
1	[deleted]
1	Are they afraid of silence? Do they just want white noise so that they don't have to think? You could recite jabberwocky like poetry, or even better play a recording of it while you wear ear plugs. That way you don't have to hear it and you don't get your vocal cords too tired. I know my vocal cords get tired really easily.\n\nAlso you could try meta-talking, treating the situation like an anthropological experiment. Talking about how other people are talking or about the social dynamic, asking leading (experimental) questions aimed at getting unusual responses.
1	I'm an INFP  (also introverted feeling)\n1) Talk only if you want to = talk rarely, make few friends  \n2) Talk all the time = probably super draining and against your values of authenticity, if you don't want to  \n3) Talk only if you want to, but if you like the person try to talk a bit more and be more open with yourself and don't be so judgmental of what you're saying because the shit most people say, even smart people, is very stupid or at least not very well informed.
12	Is this normal?	So I'm in a relationship right now with a guy (I think he's INTJ?) and although I'm super attracted to him and find him really fun to spend time with, for some reason when we can only communicate through texting or can't see each other for a lengthy period of time I start to get a little... confused? Upset, maybe?\n\nMostly it comes from me automatically assuming that he's thinking the worst about me if there's not that constant reassurance/word of affirmation. Even then, the effect those have doesn't last very long. I wonder if I just slip into a FiNi loop or something, where I come up with these unfounded hunches and automatically assume they're true. Like, if he doesn't say goodnight or doesn't respond with much enthusiasm (I guess, if I'm giving more than he's giving back) then it really messes with my head, and typically in person I keep my distance and stay reserved until I feel like he's earned my "trust" again. Which is so weird, I don't know.\n\nIs this type of thinking in the early stages of a relationship normal? I wonder if ISFP's are the type least likely to thrive in a long-distance type relationship, since we tend to enjoy the physical presence of our partners and communicate affection in terms of actions rather than plain old texts that convey nothing of the sort.
7	INTJ here. I dated an ISFP for two years. I'm not much of a texter and it would freak him out and make him anxious when I forget to say goodnight or am more succinct with my texts—I didn't realize it was affecting him that much until he vocalized it to me. \n\nI would just tell your INTJ that it bothers you. Make sure you explain your feelings clearly. Sometimes, we have a hard time understanding where people are coming from with their emotions but if you can explain it well, chances are that they will be understanding and will adjust accordingly. Just be honest and clear. 
5	I’ve been with my partner for almost 2 years and he’s quite a busy man. If I haven’t seen him physically for a full week (but still text everyday) I still get somewhat...I wouldn’t call it shy but I’m a little more reserved than I would normally be compared to being with him for a few days. I think it’s an ISFP thing now that you’ve shed some light on this. I thought it was just me. 
2	You sound like my twin. I have experienced this in past relationship and I am experiencing it now, both INTJs. I'm going to bed now but I'll think on it and get back to you tomorrow.
2	It's definitely in the early stages, just be open, and if honesty about who you are bothers them... Well you know... Probably not a great person anyways.. 
2	ISFP here.\n\nI did LD with an INTJ for a few years. It was extremely tough - and he was more balanced than most of them. It didn't work out in the end and he was very cold about it. More than that I would *not* recommend LD unless you really can't help it. I found the lack of 'real' contact to be a big thing and we Skyped 2-3 times a week to make up for it. It was still no comparison to being together irl which we were able to be once a month. You are astute enough to realise you have these needs, it is not down to you to quash them for him it is up to you to vocalise them and to reach an agreement between the two of you that makes you both happy. The question is if he is mature enough in his type to care. \n\n-NTJ's will not appreciate having to constantly re-earn your trust if they believe you are already close and you are not talking to them about what you need. That's not a good behaviour and something you should work on no matter who you are with, it's hard work and unnecessary. That's an emotional maturity thing as much as personality type. You're game playing when you do that even though you may not realize it. Imagine how annoying you'd find it if someone you were dating was hot/cold all the time. \n\nAll in all while the LD/very different personality type leant itself to a lot of personal growth, in the end the S/N difference was not easy to ignore - for him who broke it off but also for me who understood why. 
2	Tell him what you think. I'm dating an intj (Ldr) we have been texting each other nonstop for about 7 months and talk on the phone every day at least once. It sounds like you're just generally feeling insecure about the situation. Best thing to do is just tell them exactly what you're feeling and hope they understand. INTJs are known for being straight forward and direct with communication and liking th at in return. 
2	Im an isfp dating an intj long distance and we're one year strong. We do see eachother every few weeks tho. \n\nIdk man the jumping to conclusions thing is just something you have to be conscious of and learn to set aside/ take with a grain of salt. It helps to talk to him about it in a non confrontational way with the disclaimer that youre aware you tend to overthink a lot. If hes a good dude he should be understanding and you can ease your mind. But yea i used to be way worse about that type of thing and ive learned to take a few steps back when i feel paranoia taking hold.
0	Fellow ISFPs, let's go troll the INTP sub	
20	Pass
14	goes and sits quietly
1	What the fuck are you inferior SFs planning!?
1	How? 🤔
0	ISFP Gone Wrong	So I know you guys untyped me as ISFP, but I don't believe y'all. I'm ISFP, *DEAL WITH IT* 😎
5	K
3	Hm
3	Ok
1	Sluta upp med det här 
1	Hahahaha, you can be whatever you want to be! You seem too extroverted to be an ISFP though, I’m guessing you’ve read the other types?
4	I'M ISFP! LET'S GROUPHUG YAYAZ	Hey guys, newly discovered ISFP here, I'm sloppiest ISFP ever without good manners, moral behaviour, without artistic ability/creativity and my jokes typically goin' too far and be weird. Anyway, what'ya all been up to lately?
24	you seem a bit bubbly and outgoing for an isfp, but hi, welcome to the family 
8	No
2	*hug* i challenge you for sloppiest isfp ever! Lol
5	10 VIEWS BUT NO ONE HUGGED ME BACCK :(( FOREVER ALONE (JK)
6	How can I get the balls to tell my ISFP sister our mom is a narcissist?	I don't know why I pussy out when I try to tell her this. We don't really spend time together, and I make her uncomfortable for some reason. I often bother ISFPs, but I don't know why. It's very difficult for me to see into their heads, and they get annoyed and uncomfortable around me. It seems like they feel I just don't "get it". I'm trying, but I don't know what they want. Their minds are the most unusual puzzles I've ever seen. It's like their minds are from another dimension. It's so strange.\n\nI think it's important to note that growing up with out of touch, emotionally immature parents and a narc mom in culturally socially strange places is going to have a huge impact on the relationship dynamics of a family, especially when one of the brothers is egotistical, socially unintelligent, and emotionally unintelligent.\n\nThe locations operate socially and culturally like they're their own country where everyone is interested in some Netflix show, festival, or occurrence the rest of the country hasn't heard of..It's weird.\n\nMy sister seems to want to do her own thing most of the time and often has to deal with conflict from my mom, brother, father, and me.  She'll have people invade in on her space a lot. The problem is we'll need something from my mom, but she'll be around my sister, so we have no choice but to constantly come in the area she's in. Meanwhile, my sister has an unhealthy attachment to my mom.\n\nShe seems to have trouble reasoning in the same way INTPs have trouble getting their Ti and Ne to work together at a young age (inferior Te?).\n\nHow can I get the balls to tell my ISFP sister our mom is a narcissist? She won't watch or look at anything I try to show her, and I feel uncomfortable explaining it to her. For some reason, she makes me feel uncomfortable when she pays attention and listens to me. I think it has to do with our relationship and the way she pays attention to me. Those big eyes staring so attentively..*shivers* I'm not used to her behaving so calm, passively, and relaxed and her paying attention to me so directly, much less other people.
11	Just tell her. As straightforward yet gently as possible.\n\nUltimately, ISFPs prefer information to be presented in a practical manner. It might suck for her to hear it at first, but at least she'll know exactly what's going on with your mom and she can start to rethink some of those unhealthy relationships.

1	Are you INTP?
3	My ISFP sister asked me to make the playlist for her wedding reception. Want to help?	(I’ve noticed you all have pretty refined musical tastes!)\n\nI want the majority of the songs to be things that the crowd might know, but I also want to sneak in some relatively unknown songs that are immediately easy and fun to dance to.\n\n\nBride’s favorite bands: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, Queens of the Stone Age (this list might not be super helpful for looking for dance floor tunes)\n\nESTJ groom isn’t into music
3	I **love** Queens of the Stone Age!! They are great for road trips but not aren't super dancy tunes though. Try **Masters of Reality** - it's a related band and there are some really catchy songs. Get a hold of their album *Sunrise on the Sufferbus*
5	\n[A bunch of songs we played at my wedding](https://open.spotify.com/user/12127713915/playlist/0IJiPya2dqWMErZuG9u9fu?si=QB5SE8BOSEOdfhx-tqgIIg). Can’t guarantee they are danceable, but I loved the atmosphere!\n
3	Gold Digger - Kanye West
2	Shut Up and Dance by Walk the Moon
1	Cha Cha Slide :-)
1	Love in high places by kimbra, you got the love by Florence and the machine 
1	I think I just discovered a few new bands through your sister, funnily enough. Thanks!\n\nStuck On You - Mars Argo\n\nJumpstarted - Jukebox The Ghost \n\nI Belong In Your Arms - Chairlift\n\n\n\n
1	I would love some Owl City in my imaginary wedding. It's popular, but it's also uplifting and beautiful!
1	Death Grips- Piss Piss
1	Don't know if I'm too late to the party, but here goes! (Disclaimer: friends often note that music I consider "happy" is sad to them, but I try!!!)\n\n* Electric Love - BØRNS\n* Shell Games - Bright Eyes\n* Come on Eileen - Dexy's Midnight Runners\n* 400 Lux - Lorde\n* Grace Kelly - Mika\n* Dance Anthem of the 80s - Regina Spektor
11	Are you into ASMR?	I don't listen that often but I really like it!!! I get the tingles and soooo relaxed.
6	No I think it's creepy 
4	I don’t get tingles or any sensation, but gentle voices are nice to listen anyway.
5	Oh hell yes I am. infact I'm an ISFP ASMRist. I love head tingles~ 
3	Heck to the no for me. It's like the auditory equivalent of being breathed on by a stranger
2	Well, i do love Bob Ross and his super calm voice. It's so good and relaxing. I could watch him all day. I also like ASMR but some videos are just too weird or bad. 
2	Yesss i love asmr. My husband, on the other hand, thinks it’s creepy and doesn’t understand why it’s supposed to be relaxing 😂
2	No
2	I prefer ambient music
2	Love it!! I love soap carving and hair washing ones. Love me some tingles.
1	Yes!! But not ASMR where someone is speaking, lol. My favorite ones are the tapping ones
1	ASMR is like visual meditation is to lucid dreaming. Imma hook you up with that good sh!t.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMSILdW68zc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMSILdW68zc)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFqAvcuuCeA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFqAvcuuCeA)
1	I'm a little bit addicted to ASMR lol\n\nMy favourite AMSRtists are Gibi ASMR and Goodnight Moon
31	any lazies up in here?	do you think ISFPs are too laid-back to the extent of it being projected as laziness or lack of motivation? \n
24	yes, and i've also been told my distress tolerance is too high/i "just let people walk all over me." i see a grain of truth to this but i think it's more that other (mostly high Je-valuing) people are unnecessarily attached to what they expect/want vs. what happens in reality and they label any sort of momentary lapse in interpersonal paranoia as "disrespect"
11	I am always like "yeh do whatever you want if it doesnt bother me too much" but I am also very lazy so theres that
5	Yeah
4	Yes, I am incredibly lazy and unmotivated 
4	That's the bad side to me being laid back, lol. It's gotten to the point where outside of thinking about the future or social situations with people I hate, I basically never feel stress anymore. Which is nice sometimes but now I'm trying to keep my final English mark from being a 65 when for most of my time in high school 90-95 was my average.
3	Oh god yeah. It’s over the top sometimes.
3	Yup, probably everyone here hahaha.
3	You should see my house and my car. Always a wreck, I hate it
2	Yes, very true.
2	Yes. Hello. 
22	A perfect example of an ISFP	Shy at first but when they reveal their inner self you can see the craziest things you ever saw.\n\n[Watch this performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPHVLxm8U-0)
10	Thanks for sharing this link \- what a great video. I think many ISFP talents are hidden, some of us (like this girl in the beginning) are too afraid to share them with the world..or not even that, like we're afraid of ourselves. It wasn't nervousness from the crowd she was feeling, it was pressure she had on herself. Some of us need to wing it in order to perform (notice how her dancing was her just feeling it, nothing pre\-planned). This is hard to express in a dominant Te world in which society pushes us to be more Te.
7	It's why the whole "first impressions count" approach never works on ISFPs
3	I usually cringe at AGT but this was really nice and refreshing. 
2	video gave me hard tingles negl
1	o_o   OMG is right   (INTJ)
4	Birth order	Been researching a little on birth order and Myers Briggs type to see any correlations...what order are you in your family? Only, oldest, middle, youngest, etc.?
8	Middle. Kid #3 out of 4. 
4	Youngest here! My closest sibling is 9 years older.
4	Only
2	Youngest 
2	Youngest
2	Youngest of 3 kids
2	youngest of 3!
2	middle
2	Youngest of 3
2	I think you'd have a better chance finding the answer you're looking for by figuring out the types of parents and the types of their kids. I have an ISFJ mother and ESTP dad, an ISFP sister, and an INTJ brother. I'm an INTP.\n\nMy grandma is an ENFJ. I presume her first husband is an INTP, though he may be an ENTP or INTJ. He's an unhealthy, abusive alcoholic philosopher with ego issues. Their kids consist of an ISFJ, an ESFP, and I'm not sure what the other one is (ISFP??).\n\nMy dad's brother is an ESTP (a twin), his sister is an ISFP??, and I'm not sure what his dad is (introverted sensor if I had to guess), but his mom is an ESFJ.\n\nMy grandma has an ESTP brother and an ENFP sister. I don't know what their other siblings are (one is an ISTJ I think; the others died). I don't know what their parents were. The dad was in the military, and I get XSTJ vibes from him, but then again, he was in the military.

7	Very Important, Nationally Influential Person I Really Should Impress for the Future of My Career: \n\n“Okay everyone, tell us how you got into this field”\n\nEveryone Else: \n\n“I was introduced because a family member had *relevant health condition* and I really just fell in love with the field and the clients and I love that I make a difference in people’s lives!” \n\nMe: \n\n“I wanted to do something else, but I found this on Indeed.com”\n\n*facepalm*
3	My name is josh\n
2	Haha that's very good.
30	Why is it so hard to get my thoughts out?	My ideas or even if I watch a lecture \- I have such difficulty summarizing what I learned. Or eloquently discussing theories/ideas with colleagues. I find difficulty verbally and slight difficulty written. How can I improve this? Or am I just destined to be misunderstood? For example, I watched a really profound video regarding relationships and spirituality \- but you'd have to hit me over the head to get me to explain it well. It's in my head and I got the message, but I can't explain it.
9	I hate that I have this problem but I do! I think so much, but I just cant get it out.  Even little things like talking about the details of my day with my husband, I find it hard to get out. The thing I have found that helps me is if I’m relaxed, and I’m confident that the people I’m talking to won’t “judge” me (I hate the word judge - maybe have a negative opinion about me?), I’m much more able to express my thoughts. \nThis isn’t really possible in most professional settings, but what I do with my husband is if something is causing strong emotion - positive or negative - I take some time alone to think it through myself. Then, I’ll have a glass or two of wine (I’m not a drinker and don’t like being drunk but just enough to let loose a little), and I’ll discuss with him! Also, I find it much easier to open up while driving with someone - this has actually been proven by psychologists, and it’s because the person is not facing you, and not looking at you, it’s less intimidating and judge mental body language and therefore easier to open up! \nIt also helps to talk to fellow introverts and people who are not overbearing, so you don’t feel like you have to compete for a word.\nHope that helps? Lol any other insight I would appreciate as well because going “on a drive” or having a glass of wine with colleagues or your boss is not always an option.
4	You've asked for tips so I'll do *my* best to articulate what kind of works for me :P I think I get caught up by trying to explain the whole thing of whatever I just found out about. Say i find a cool Wiki entry on a mass conspiracy - which leads me to 4 more. I can read and comprehend it all and love the story it has just given me but when I go to tell someone about it I do my best to link all aspects of the 5 wikis in and my retention is honestly so poor that I get lost in my own story. So choose small quips about whatever you have just taken in that fascinate you the most and think about why you like them in that context so much, once you know why you like those facts or paragraphs so much it makes it easier to remember and link them eloquently. Taking in and seeing the big picture is something we do innately, we get there without an awful lot of logic and reasoning so trying to explain ourselves can defo be tough. \n\nIt also helps to revisit subject matter you enjoy so you can take in more of it. Engage in more content similar to what you just watched to keep your interest up (eg. go take in more videos on relationships and spirituality. The bits that repeat themselves you will remember from before and the new bits will stand out as new.) \n\nEventually you can choose to learn about topics linked to those, and you will make connections between those, and the process kind of starts again with learning but you have a base now. Before you know it you'll be able to talk to anyone about that subject. Just keep it concise and focused. 
3	Once you've absorded the material, pretend you're explaining it to someone else, out loud is even better. If you'd actually take that habit for everything and anything, you'd find yourself a lot more in control over your every thoughts. 
1	I’ve found that I’m better at giving my personal take on something rather than just summarizing what it’s generally about.  I’m guessing it’s a low Te thing.
1	Sounds like an Ne blindspot and weak Ti and Te.
3	Love languages	Hello all!\nCurious...what would you say your love language is (or the way you feel most loved)?\n1. Thoughtful gifts\n2. Words of affirmation/encouragement\n3. Acts of service\n4. Quality time\n5. Physical touch and closeness
3	Physical touch. Second is probably acts of service. 
3	In a romantic relationship? Quality time, physical touch, acts of service, words, gifts
3	Physical touch, quality time
2	Mine were 1 physical touch 2 acts of service 3 quality time 4 words 5 gifts
2	Definitely quality time for me.
2	My husband and I both share quality time as our top ones. My second one is words of affirmation.
1	I think it's when someone shows they've listened, and then creatively adds their own insight. . . which can be a mixture of the first 4; and hopefully there's some touch involved as well.
1	Mine changed drastically over the years. I used to be a pure time person and hated touch. Now touch is my main love language, followed by words.
1	Touch,quality time, words, acts in that order 
1	To receive:  \n1. Touch\n\n2. Words\n\n3. Time\n\n4. Gifts\n\n5. Service  \n\n\nTo give:\n\n1. Gifts\n2. Service\n3. Touch\n4. Time\n5. Words
7	How have MBTI and functions impacted you and your life?	As for me, here's the positive: much more self awareness, much more tolerance toward people as I tend to see more easily why they act the way they act, a definite will to defy isfp's bad tendencies (passivity and easily giving up for ex), being able to think of Ni loops in terms of "me looking for clues to put myself down" and not reality, a general grown interest in people and their behaviour, a more positive Ni and as such a will to understand and construct goals\n\nThe negative: Sometimes I have a hard time discerning if I am doing efforts or if I am faking and understanding if my interest in people comes from a selfish sorta need to improve or a genuine interest and love, I have thought at times to have figured out only to realize Ni was not on point on the case (but knowing we have Ni ter has allowed me much more modesty and genuine interest in the point of view of others, therefore less subjectivity), I have tended to use Ni way too much on whys and hows rather than using Se aux, which has left me feeling empty at times...\n\nI could go on haha but I am very curious! How does this whole theory affect you and your life?
5	Finding out that I have Te inferior gave me a solid excuse for my lack of productivity lol
3	Being able to explain the words and actions of others in terms of MBTI  has gone  a long way to feeling as though I understand those people and has given me hope of being understood.\n\nIn addition, further thought in this arena has given me alternate methods on constructing thoughts by intentionally negating conscious processes in favor of unconscious or subconscious processes.  \n\nI recognize just how much of what I do is based on the insecurities held in the 4th function, so I alter my aims in long term goals such that filling the void of the fourth function doesn’t become a waste of time and energy, but instead direct my goals such that attention is given to the third function where I need the most help.\n\n—\nThe negatives stem from falling into the belief that I am much more like a machine than I am, following an inner structure I cannot control. \n\nThere are false applications of this theory to be wary of, and suspending the fullest expression of belief can be helpful.  For me, understanding that mistyping happens and that no theory is immune to revision helps me to hold back from “running with it” where there are significant risks.\n\n\n
2	There is more, but to keep it short, my latest discovery has been that I am an ISFP rather than an ESFP. I always said/thought I was an extrovert because I love people and I love being in the company of others and connecting to others. But I get SO DRAINED from it. I am an introvert all the way, and just admitting to myself that I am an introvert has been kind of freeing in a way. I try not to use it as an excuse to not socialize, but it’s more like “okay, I know my limits and I know this is draining me and that’s okay. It’s okay if I soend Friday night by myself and get excited about that - and it doesn’t mean I’m a weirdo!”\nAnd that’s only with the intro/extrovert part! 
6	sense of humor?	what’s your’s like? mine ranges from sarcastic to edgy to ridiculous to witty
14	Sarcastic, dry and witty humor.
6	I like absurdist contradictions/scenarios.  \n  \nWhat makes me laugh is things like [these royal art lodge things](https://www.google.co.uk/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB734GB735&biw=1242&bih=612&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=CmcUW72NNY2GgQb8hY7QDg&q=littlesweets+royal+art+lodge&oq=littlesweets+royal+art+lodge&gs_l=img.3...18520.21627.0.21771.17.16.1.0.0.0.116.1464.12j4.16.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0....0.SdkUP2CnqNE). they're a bit precious, but it's self-aware.
9	Dad jokes, memes, pointing out ironic happenings, flirting with the same gender even though I'm straight, in\-jokes, so many in\-jokes.
5	https://youtu.be/9EvbqxBUG_c?t=276
3	edgy memes
1	dank memes
3	two questions	i don’t wanna make a second post lmao\n\nalso just confirmed my type as ISFP!! \n\n1)do you guys ever seem like extroverts? like i mistyped as an ESFP for a while until i looked deep into the functions. i love being around people and having fun, and i’ve heard that ISFP is the most extroverted introvert. your experience?\n\n2) anyone else with Borderline Personality Disorder and/or depression?\n\n
6	Depends on the context for me! I'm thinking of extroversion more in terms of mannerisms/behaviour. i'm not too informed on mbti/functions, so can't talk about it in those terms.  \n  \nI reckon I can 'switch on' extroversion if the situation calls for it. But I don't get a lot of practice, so maybe it appears ridiculous xD  \n  \n>2) anyone else with Borderline Personality Disorder?  \n  \nI don't think so. How's that working out for you?
3	I thought I was an esfp too for awhile lol.  I can be pretty extroverted but I def like my alone time and I use more fi than se.  \n\nI’m unconfirmed on borderline personality disorder, but I definitely relate to a lot of the characteristics.  I’m leaning more towards bipolar since I have a lot of highs and lows and have had manic episode experiences in the past.
1	Everyone has four different personalities actually. Your ego, unconscious, sub-conscience, and your super ego\n\nCheck this out and it really helped understand way more.\nhttps://youtu.be/ntcBulfl_IY
7	Dominant Fi	what is dominant Fi to y’all? how do you experience it in everyday life? how does it manifest in you?
8	I am an emotional man
6	It's all about how I feel about what I'm interacting with. Usually I'm a little slower in reaction than others; but it's the way I roll. *Shrugs.jpeg*
6	Strong, unbreakable moral code and sense of aesthetic preferences, and a value for authenticity. 
2	I consider Fi as giving me a set of preferences, whether they might be similar to others or not. (Actually I think most of my bonding experiences with people might come from having similar preferences.) Also usually knowing what is of worth investing my time into and what's not.\n\nAnother way of describing Fi could be a very precise way of seeing emotions. I usually know what ticks people off and what doesn't.
5	self expression?	hey guys, possible ISFP here! i was wondering, is self expression that big a part in your personality? because i suck at it and it’s the only thing keeping me back from saying ISFP. and if it is, what type of self expression? 
12	I find it difficult to express myself in a way that others truly understand it. 
6	Most isfp descriptions online are shitty.  I didn’t even consider being an isfp when I first got into mbti.  Not all isfps are artists, musicians, etc.
2	When I have some kind of pent-up emotion, or creative spark, I'll express. But mostly I just consume.  \n  \nThe form it takes is usually when I move (dance), or compose  something (music) that matches how I feel (which can take a bit of trial and error, but it's very satisfying when it hits the spot). But the point is to materialise/mirror an emotion in order to feel it with a different intensity.  \n  \nI couldn't say if it's '*that big a part in your personality*'. Given enough creature comforts, I could probably remain amused enough to not require self-expression. Usually anything creative I do is linked to a fantasy of some kind of aesthetic atmosphere/ambiance I want to escape/lose myself in.
7	Isfp spirit animal	Just curious - what would you say is your spirit animal?
16	Cat 
15	Fox bc it has qualities of both cats and dogs that I bounce back and forth on.
4	I’ve always gotten along with cats 
4	sloth
3	Lizard!
3	I used to think cat because of their independence and all that, but the thing is cats don’t really care about others, while I am deeply and genuinely caring. When I love someone (most people) I see them in a wonderful light! \n\nI think the ISFP spirit animal is a panda! Pandas are happy-go-lucky, independent, loving and caring! Also they’re adorable lol
2	Dog or Turtle \(depends on the day!\)
2	i've said this before but horse. the creepy kind.
2	Owl
2	Wolf. 100% Intelligent, independent, seeks a few strong relationships, feels threatened easily. 
2	It's funny how everyone is saying such different animals to describe the same thing. That's percievers for ya XD  \n\n\nPersonally I identify with chameleons
1	Tortoise!
1	rabbit!!!!!!!
1	Cat, absolutely. 
1	Definitely a fox. I don't think it could be anything else for me.
1	sea turtle :)
1	Beaver! Care for others who aren't even similar to you. 
1	Not real... but Toothless the dragon- off how to train your dragon.... so I guess a cat, as his characteristics where based off a big cat
1	Otter or tardigrade
15	Relationships - romantic and non	What have been the biggest issues/problems YOU have had in your past (or present) relationships?\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\nWhen I get really negatively emotional (sad or mad) about something it’s as if there is a block between my brain and my mouth and I feel like a physically can’t express myself if words. I have to be alone, calm down, and then come back to talk.\n\nWith friendships, I feel like I cant keep them. I don’t know if it’s because I try hard to be up and happy and let my “fun outgoing” side show and then I burn out, or what but I feel like I’ve never met a single person other than my husband that I can truly be myself around - both my fun/goofy/light as well as my introspective/deep-thinking/more serious side.
5	Gosh, I relate to this post 100%.\nAre you me? 😂 because i am also married and i feel the exact same way.\n\nI feel like i am incapable of making long lasting friendships :/\nBut my husband has made me realize that i am quite an impatient person. Meaning that i want deep friendship right away. But forming close relationships takes time.\nBut my dilemma is that, i dont want to extend my energy and heart into making a friendship to someone if it doesnt work out.
2	I think what you posted and not having enough personal space. I need space in order to feel better.
1	Relationships: Irrational, emotional, impatient. Working on them all. \n\nFriendships: I feel similar. The outgoing side is so draining, I LOVE being in close friendship with people where even silence is companionable. I do have a small circle at the moment though and meeting people has been so so tough in my new city so I need to get over that! 
1	Do you know your husband's type?
1	Not making myself available and fluctuating interest.  I can be very into a person for days, weeks, or an extended period of time, and then totally lose track of them.  On the romantic side, I can be pretty guarded and anxious when I first get to know a girl.  Gotten a lot better with maturity thankfully!
1	Yeah a recent development in my romantic relationship is in quite a number of situations I just stop talking... if he asks me questions I will happily "tap once for yes, or two for no". Its usually about something I don't want to talk about, or don't want to say because I don't want to upset him or make the situation worse. 
3	What song best describes the ISFP?	Curious to see how we’re perceived!
8	Easy by Lionel Richie is a fairly straightforward one\n\ni'm a huge Lana Del Rey fan so i have to say something like Ride or In My Feelings
6	Black Water by Of Monsters and Men for Fi Ni
5	Frank Ocean \- Seigfried
6	Born to die by Lana Del Rey
3	Somebody to Love by Queen is a good one!
2	Let's be still by the head and the heart
1	Way late to the conversation, but Tom Waits' "What's he building in there?" has always been a non ironic metaphorical anthem of isfp for me.
2	This roleplay video appeals to me on a spiritual level	
17	Why?	Why is this sub soooo dead? Seriously, where is everyone? We need more action here! 
16	-We tend to underestimate ourselves (making us shy about posting and feeling irrelevant)\n\n-We also tend to be extremely private people (hardly easy on a sub about personality)\n\n-We have Se aux, so a healthy state means doing a lot and with others because it is extroverted, which does not quite fit a sub on the internet about a psychological theory. \n\n-But we also tend to take for granted stereotypes about us (not having to say much anyway)\n\n-Which leads us to conform to a type, to be stagnant and to not ask ourselves enough whys and how to improve (no offense, I still think we are amazing people and I love you all, but for real)\n\n-Start action my dude we're all down for good challenges when they're here B)
20	We don't have much to say, we're ISFPs after all.
10	For some reason ISFPs are rather absent from reddit and the internet in general, from what I can tell.
10	Honestly, don't really have an idea. But as others have commented, reddit isn't really a place where ISFPs congregate. But, well, that doesn't mean we can't do anything about this sub either... \n\nBut we also need a new banner. And I've also thought of making an art subreddit specifically for us ISFPs, when I have time, in case verbal expression is not enough. I mean, we are known for being one of the most nonverbal types after all... (and it might also be a great outlet for our suppressed feelings)
3	From what I've seen, most of them are on Facebook groups.
1	I feel you. 
1	They're on social medias like twitter and instagram.
1	good question. But easy to answer. We're are trying to entertain eachother. But we don't wanna get ahead of ourselfes. I'm saying that is a very likely possibility don't take my word as fact :v\n
1	If you have to ask, you'll never know.
4	hey,isfps how good are you at?	how good are you at self hypnosis?.eg if you forggot something be able to enter a meditative state to retrieve that information.or using auto suggestion?
12	as an ISFP what are your pet Peeves?	Hey everybody! As an ISFP how do you personally feel about how the rest of the type's label you as? I'll start.\n\nOne problem I seem to have as an ispf is that the other types especially the more TJ types feel that the isfp don't have the capacity for regular intelligence, not just emotional intelligence. Now don't get me wrong I am a solid isfp, the whole way, I can puppy a rainbow just like every other isfp, but when discussing more intellectual there is the stigma of not being able to carry or follow along the discussion. Anybody else find this to be the case? Intelligence has nothing to do with Personality type probably my biggest pet peeve.
17	Probably people who think making someone angry or pissing someone off is fun. Heck, most of the time I don't really get offended by those people, but the very thought that they find *that* funny really pisses me off for some reason.
7	I do and find its true. TJs can go on and on about a topic and I already out the window ready to talk about something else 
8	This topic came up on the ISFP Facebook group and I said something similar:  \n1. People telling me to stop being weird as if they're embarrassed by me.  \n2. People who say dumb things for the sake of preserving a state of conflict and don't actually care about what they're arguing for.  \n3. When people dismiss my opinions just because I've opened up my silly side to them and they think I can't make an informed opinion just because I suck at explaining things. 
4	The intelligence thing annoys me insofar as that I wish I was more intelligent, and I really appreciate intelligence in others, but I can't keep up with the really clever around me. Usually that's fine until a -tj comes along who literally judges you for it despite massively lacking in interpersonal and emotional intelligence. But hey.. I'm not bitter ;)
3	People who can't answer simple questions. I have this problem with the person I live with, whenever I ask a "here or there?" question, she always has to make an unnecessarily long-winded answer that I have to listen/read through when the answer could have been simplified into one word.
2	If I look laidback or going with the flow, I’m labeled as lazy, lacking initiative, or flippant.\n\nWhere really I’m probably doing the most work subtly manipulating where the flow is going, based on passion for values.
3	It's annoying when I barely know much about the topic and they know even less. And they act like I don't know anything or I'm just not understanding what they're saying. And they will keep going on this topic for hours. While I'm just sitting there trying to move on to a happier topic. Or just a new one in general and just agreeing with what they say. Just to stop the arguments coming.

11	Jobservations	Hi. Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/8emrrw/finally_found_a_nice_isfpish_job/) by an animal caretaker person, I thought I'd share a couple of quick observations from some of the jobs I've stumbled into. If anyone wants to share their own experiences, or comment on mine, then please feel free.  \n  \n*Bartending*  \nI always felt out of place. It was a masquerade—but the time flew by when it was busy, so the money felt easy.  \nBut not being myself took the spring out of my step.  \n  \n*Cook (short-order, small kitchen)*  \n* Kitchens are a bit of a refuge for outcasts and weirdos, so it was fun letting loose.  \n* A lot of jobs I've had play-down anything involving the senses, but a kitchen expects and rewards a critical eye, nose, ear, tongue.  \nManipulating the colours and forms when plating up was great fun - especially desserts.  \n* I enjoyed working in a small team, getting to know a few people well. Supporting each other. The camaraderie, and also the in-jokes, and silliness. I never thought I'd consider myself a 'team player', but I guess I became one without realising.  \n* That said—it was stressful, taxing on the working memory (I wanted to test my limits, but I never got the hang of it), and the 12-hour shifts felt like a sentence.  \nAnd then there was the radio. The fucking radio.  \nIt's an easy job to get into, and I'm glad I did it. Give it a go if you have any interest.  \n  \n*Gardener*  \nI had a cushy job looking after a few gardens for the local council.   \n* I loved looking after the flowers, the immersion in colour. You do a job and immediately see the difference you've made.  \n* Being a part of nature, the seasons being relevant, etc. I would be up for the orange glow of sunrise, and put the sprinklers out with the twilight. It was all very manicured—but with all the smells and birdsong and whatnot, I became aware I was on the revolving earth.  \n* I didn't do it for anyone else, but people would often come up and share their gratitude/appreciation. Plant people are lovely. (I'd inadvertently surrounded myself with relaxed, happy people).  \n  \n----  \n\nI'll finish on a sour-ish note: I don't know if it's to do with type, or if it's me, but I've never felt like I *belonged* in any job I've had. Like, this is something I'm doing until I figure out how I want to spend the majority of my energy. I'm just standing-in until someone better suited comes along. I'm in the waiting room.  \n  \nWhen do you/don't you feel like an impostor?  \n\n  \nStill, I'm attracted to jobs where I have a small role with greater implications. A masseuse relieving a worker's pains so they can play with their children. A beekeeper spreading wildflower. A woodsman creating habitats, birdsong, clean air. A luthier creating instruments for beautiful music.
6	Okay, I'll bite.\n\nIce skating teacher: I enjoyed working with the little kids, and playing games with them. I found being watched by their parents a little nervewracking though.\n\nCashier: Boring, but fine. Not really much to say here.\n\nServer: I was completely terrible at this. I forgot things all the time. I think I'm just a bad multitasker.\n\nPCA (Old Folks' Home Worker): I was also terrible at this. I hated that I never had enough time to properly tend to anyone, let alone make a connection with them. I think the idea of working in health care is appealing to me, but the current understaffed/overworked system is just too stressful\n\nTree planter: This was sweet. I liked being outside, and being alone with my thoughts. I got paid per tree so nobody (other than me) really cared how hard I worked. The amount of progress I could see each day was also sweet.\n\nSki Hill Lift Operator: This was a great job. I got paid to ski, and spent the whole day outside. It was just too little pay in too expensive of a ski town to do long term.\n\nSki Patroller: I still got paid to ski, but now I had more responsibility. Overall I enjoyed it, but I struggled with being overly critical of how I handled patients. I tended to go over how I could've been better after each patient.\n\nConstruction worker: Another outdoors job, which I liked. Again, I liked seeing the progress as we built things. My main dislike was the amount of overtime/weekend work that made it really difficult to maintain work/life balance.\n\nResearcher/computer programmer: This was an interesting job. Mostly it was incredibly frustrating, but it was also super exciting when my code actually worked.\n\nEngineer: This is what I do now. It is okay. I still am involved in a lot of construction projects which are fun to watch get built. I also get to work a lot with landscape architects because I do a lot of city pathways, ponds, rivers, etc. so I get to make things pretty. I stick with it because I like the slow pace of work (I'm rarely rushed), rarely/never working evenings or weekends, getting like 6 weeks of vacation a year, being able to work from home when I want, and having enough money to pursue all of my hobbies.\n\nIf I had to start over, I think top choices for me would be a gardener, carpenter, or landscape architect. However, I think I'm pretty satisfied with an imperfect job that gives me the freedom to do exactly what I want in my free time.

2	Hotel housekeeping: a little gross. Well, a LOT gross. Hard work. But full days of taking care of details and not talking to anybody. Days went by fast. \n\nVet assistant: literally held dogs for a living. Also cleaned up a lot of blood and poop.  Very hard work and 14 hour days for little pay. But still a lot of fun - again, taking care of details, not having to talk much and time flew. \n\nVideographer assistant: nooope. Cool experience but I am not assertive enough to boss people around. \n\nData entry: oh god kill me. This job involved a lot of eating to keep myself sane. Also one of those jobs where you stay for 8 hours and have to look busy even if there’s nothing to do. \n\nTruck dispatching: yeah I’m not organized or assertive enough for this one. I was good at finding solutions for weird stuff that came up but didn’t love being screamed at every time I answered the phone. \n\nWeb-based customer service: this is my current role. It’s okay. I get to email instead of phoning most of the time, so that’s nice. I work with an even number of I and E, but still find everyone is too into small talk.  I have a lot of pressure-prompted tasks sometimes and that’s nice. I also have days where the only thing on my plate is data management or emails to touch base with clients. Those days are less nice. They provide us with cookies. 
2	YESSSS!!!\n\nI've worked as a bartender... was fun to start with, but I found my snarky, sarcastic, un-empathetic side started creeping out and I felt like I was losing myself. That on top of the late hours and shitty other staff who were there to socialise than get any work done. \n\nWorked as a zoo attendant, because I like animals... even so much as going to uni for 3 years to study zoology (only to quit), then trying my hand at a TAFE degree (trade degree) in animal studies... only to lose interest in that and quit also. But I was going through a tough time mentally as well so that may be in part due to the fact of losing interest, and being unmotivated. \n\nNow studying another TAFE degree in travel... haven't wanted to quit and I'm almost finished... but if I'm honest I don't think its what I'd really want to do. Actually I've never known what I want to do, and its been a HUGE stressor on my life. I hate the thought of working a 9-5, I don't believe in full time work. Which coming from a family of extremely hard workers is concerning, and so I have never expressed this to any of them. And people look at me and think I'm crazy. But I feel as long as I'm happy and healthy I don't care what I'm doing. \n\nI'm also a photographer, have had a number of small paid event photographing jobs, but its more of just a hobby for me, I don't think there's any point in pursuing a career in the field because everyone's a Damn photographer these days so it'd be very competitive. So I'm happy just doing once off events every so often. \n\nOnce upon a time I enjoyed learning and going to school, but since going to uni and feeling like I suck at it I loathe the idea of returning. But if I did I think I'd hope to go into a teaching position as well as a careers advisor ... very ironic I know, but I figure if I can't help myself I might as well help others... And I'm fucking fantastic at doing that hahaha. \n\nTL:DR - worked as a receptionist, bartender, zookeeper, freelance photographer, pet sitter, nothing sticks. And studied 3 degrees, 2 of which I've quit, the 3rd I've almost finished but I don't think its what I want to do... 
1	How much was your salary as a gardener?
85	Thought this would be relatable for a lot of ISFPs	
22	Nah, i just don't have anything to talk about.
15	Reasons why I don't like starting conversations first: \n\n* I don't know if you care about this topic at all\n\n* I have nothing to contribute to a previous related conversation\n\n* I am not knowledgeable about the things you are interested in\n\n* Everyone has their own opinion and I don't want to force mine on you\n\n* There is no reason for a conversation to happen in this circumstance\n\nHowever\n\n* If you talk to me first and have to make attempts to keep the conversation going, it probably means that I'm attempting to end the conversation and you are annoying.  If I like the conversation we're having, I'll help you keep it going naturally.\n\nedit:\n\n* If none of the previous things are true, I'll start the conversation.
5	I think this is pretty accurate :) although it also can be because we don't have anything to talk about too.
2	cute
16	"watching movies"	DAE find themselves zoning out for a while visualizing possible scenarios with different people? Like how things would play out with your bf if you rearranged the furniture? Or what could have happened if you had transferred to a different store? I feel like I spend a ridiculous amount of time imagining how conversations are gonna go. Sometimes it would be cool if it was a movie, I end up in some pretty random places.   
2	Yes, absolutely. 
2	But isn't it good that you exercise your imagination 💭!?
2	Sometimes I think of funny “movies” and laugh out loud seemingly at nothing - so often that the people I’m around are used to it cause I’ve had to say “oh I just thought of something funny” ....but it’s so far in a rabbit hole that I cant explain it lol
14	What is your flirting style? I’d say I’m confident enough to freely flirt with anyone but the main problem when it comes to the dating scene for me is that I tend to not approach (girls in my situation) for the reason of thinking I don’t want to bother the person...as stupid as it may sound.	How are my ISFP bros or girls doing on this particular scene? Do you have similar feelings?
11	If I flirt, it’s because I’m doing it by accident. And I’m totally with you on that last part. My fiancée was the one who initiated our first few conversations, I wasn’t picking up the hint she wanted to date me (I also had a roommate that picked up on it and thought it was directed at him, because he was there every time we spoke), so she said screw it and texted me asking if I wanted to go to her place for dinner. She made some Alaskan Salmon, and I brought over broiled potatoes. The rest is history.\n\nThere was a time that I was a bit more confident and actually asked some girls out on dates, but I was terrified the entire time. I’d say continue to build up the courage to ask someone out and don’t over analyze the situation. It’s never as bad as you think it will be. 
5	I’m either all in or not at all.  Not a big fan of subtlety tbh
3	I suck at flirting. When I was single I was just more nice and giving to the person of interest. Later, after dating someone else I told a few of them that yeah I flirted with them. They responded that they had no idea. They thought I was just really nice. It sucked.
2	I tend to flirt through eye context, intentional conversation, and winking. 
1	I am confident enough to freely flirt with people I don't see in that perspective, but I don't really mind it and nor do they. As for looking for a suitor...I seem to forget all tactics and the meaning of the word "chill", I turn into this awkward goofy weird ball of confusion.... So I guess you can say I can relate.
1	How Do I Help My Sister?	How do I make this email appealing and inviting to my ISFP sister?\n\nhttp://www.roguecc.edu/Counseling/HollandCodes/test.asp\n\nhttps://80000hours.org\n\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test\n\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/more-type-profiles/\n\nhttps://www.lifeadvancer.com/emotionally-immature-parents\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPIzRdz6XI&t=11s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f58UxJyIV3A&t=6s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZH-1YTCvHA\n\nMovies:\nAmélie\nMiyazaki Films\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\nBoyhood\nSweeney Todd\n\nTV Shows:\nSteven Universe\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm wanting to show her why her mom treats her the way she does and how to deal with it. She doesn't realize why her mom acts the way she does, and it's hurting her. She also doesn't realize she needs to change her approach to choosing a career. She thinks she wants to be a K-12 teacher but doesn't realize what it's like.\n\nShe usually doesn't check nor respond to my emails nor texts, and I seem to bother her for some reason. I'm an INTP IAS. My Fe and Fi are pretty well-developed. I think showing her directly would cause issues.
8	Share your unconventional music tastes	Since I'm willing to bet some of you might have some *wink* how about it? I know my music taste can be pretty different from most peoples (don't mean to brag lol), most of the music I listen to is alternative house, more specifically [house arranges from game music](https://youtu.be/L87tmaJa9io). (If someone were to go through my playlist, this kind of music will be likely to show up often.) \n\n'Nyways let me see what you guys have. If you feel vulnerable exposing your music though, then I'm not pushing you.
12	Frank Ocean, Anderson Paak, BROCKHAMPTON, Sampha, Gallant, Glenn Miller, Erykah Badu, The Internet, Tame Impala, Childish Gambino, Vulfpeck, Daniel Caesar, Tyler, The Creator, Phony Ppl
8	 v a p o r w a v e
6	I have 5 moods; Any jazz \(other than smooth or freeform jazz\), electro swing, funk/disco, video game music \(particularly the soundtracks of Red Alert 2 and Bastion\), and occasionally some other weeby non\-vg related chiptunes/edm.\n\nMy [Spotify Daily Mixes](https://i.imgur.com/f4KMt45.png) are a good snapshot of the kinds of things I listen to.
6	Björk, TR/ST, The Knife, Grimes, Kate Bush, MF DOOM and all of his pseudonyms, Travis Scott, Death Grips, Black Flag, Tame Impala, Vampire Weekend, Alvvays, Jaloo, and lots of Vaporwave like Blank Banshee, Luxury Elite, Esprit, and such \n\nOther genres I'm fond of are City Pop, chiptune, samba, Latin Pop, and film soundtracks
4	Alternative rock
3	 R&B, or Kpop mainly, but even kpop for me has it's like subdivisions based on my moods.\n\nR&B:\nJussie Smollet\nGallant\nBlackbear \nKpop:\nPentagon\nN.Flying\nNCT\nZico\nMonsta X\nSeventeen
2	I tend to not really listen to music until I find a connection with the artist, or it's unique enough to pique my interest. Hence not much top 40 unless I get in a Lyft or Uber and something tricks me into liking it lol. All that said, I have 3 top artists that have lyrics, I actually pay attention to, and then it bleeds out from there to associated acts and bizarre musicals. In no particular order they're Tom Waits, Butch Walker, and Man Man. God damn, if you've never heard of any of them, do yourself a favor and enter their isfp worlds, utterly beautiful. As for just good old weird shit Mr. Bungle or any Mike Patton as well as anything Wes Borland touches as a side project. Sorry for the ramble, it's time for bed.
2	90s emo, 2000s-present hip hop, indie music, and pre-WWII blues
2	I don't know if any of this will fit in with what you are asking... \n\nOutside of Indie Folk and other popular music in that area like The Head and the Heart, I listen to Dream Theater and Liquid Tension Experiment (by far my go to music after the typical, helps keep me awake on long road trips). I also LOVE Micheal Jackson and then Oldies like 50's and 60's stuff. 
2	I have kind of random music taste , my favorite bands are Vampire Weekend, Talking Heads, Beastie Boys, The Clash, The Beatles, ABBA, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé...
1	Fight the Feeling - Stick Figure.\n\nI’m a big pacific reggae fan. Anyone lookin for new tunes- Stick Figure, Slightly Stoopid, iration, the movement, mishka, Iya Terra. Good music is everywhere, just gotta find it \n\nAlso-\n\nBlackbird - Fat Freddie’s Drop \n\n\nOP check out Cola (club mix). Also check out mixes by jauz, Eptic and “Habstrakt- Diplo and Friends mix”. Tell me whatcha think 
1	Classical opera- Maria Callas, Wagner, etc... LOVE IT
1	I listen to a pretty wide range of music, from modern hip-hop, to alternative/folk, to classic rock and pop.\n\nSome of my favs off the top of my head are The Seige, Fleet Foxes, Trippie Redd, Cat Stevens, Travis Scott, Kanye West, Run the Jewels, Lorde,  Hozier, Gucci Mane, Lil Pump, Chvrches, Broods and Simon & Garfunkel
1	John Prine 
1	I write chiptune/8-bit music which is generally kinda unconventional I guess as its own thing.\n\nIn the same vein as your house remixes from games, I enjoy the [Mega Man Nonstop Remixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1t6I7wE5AE&list=PLThxnlZm3yUtOwcL01n-Dj4I9A-tIBJQj) that were done a few years ago.\n\nOh, and [Crash Twinsanity's OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGH3l-IgAtQ&list=PL9A06BA8BC88B4F0F) is pretty neat too.
1	Currently jamming to Lonnie Smith and the Cosmic Echoes- Visions of a New World album.\nAnything kinda bouncy/funky, like Kaytranada or Pomo remixes. Whoever produces Kendrick's albums too I owe much thanks.\n\nOn another note, I like really twangy indie and folk, like Caitlyn Smith and the Hillbilly Thomists.
1	I especially love long progressive songs, from bands like Dream Theater and Pink Floyd. Also I've gotten a little into NǽnøĉÿbbŒrğ VbëřřĦōlökäävsŦ, a really weird ambient thing, but not enough that I'd really call it part of my music taste.\n\nI also make a pretty unique genre of music, but that's more out of necessity than anything else, lol. I'm not really into electronic music, but the only way I have at the moment to make music is an app for making electronic music (basically lets you make midi files but more user friendly). The result is very non-electronic musicish electronic music.
1	Stellardrone, Carbon based lifeforms, Max Carbacho. A tickle for the soul
1	I like to find an artist or song from any genre bc I don't want to limit myself just to one type of music. I believe that you can find a song in each genre and in different languages if you look hard enough. \n\n I've had language exclusive time periods. I've done spanish, french, german, korean, Japanese,  russian, and Chinese.  Eurovision has helped find new artists through youtube.  I haven't been able to get fully into noise music tho.  \n\nWhere do you like to find new music? MySpace opened up a lot of music to me before going to last fm and now I'm on spotify. Never left youtube it's not as region blocked as spotify.\n\nEdit: I only know english.
1	Ambient and Indian Classical
1	Bands / musicians I enjoy regularly - Kaleo, ed sheeran, hozier, of monsters and men, the lumineers, Ben Howard, hang of youths, James Bay, Kodaline, Lewis Watson, Sam smith, Vance joy.\n\nGotta be in the mood for but really enjoy- my dads music - Aussie rock, pop songs from the 50's/ 60's, 80's 90's. 
7	Lifestyle analysis for MBTI survey - 3 minutes to fill, will post results in a week. Participate too!!	
2	I think some of the questions here left me wanting. I think some questions needed more answers. 
6	ISFP's: who's your favorite character from lord of the rings?	Also, please note if you're referring to the book character or the movie character, since they differ somewhat :)
8	Samwise! I haven't read the books in a long time, but from the movies, it's definitely Sam.
7	Legolas. I like him both in the books and movies
3	I was always taken with Boromir \n
3	Movies: Sam.\n\nWhen I read the books as a kid, I was a fan of Faramir. 
3	Obviously Gollum
2	Gandalf
2	1. Sam\n2. Legolas (because of archery and two swords) 
1	When I was in fifth grade I had a huge crush on Legolas. 
1	I fall asleep every time I even think of those books/movies, so no one
1	Eowyn, both!
1	Legolas!
1	**Boromir**, that man is so torn and flawed. Sean Bean nailed that casting!
1	am i the only one who loves Aragorn?? i picture myself being like him, given the circumstances 
1	Gimli is my hero 
12	Emotional Extremes	I am an ISFP human struggling to grasp the actions and unrequited love of someone I hold dear. I have a tendency to be emotionally invested in people I come across that peak my interest. And this one person in particular I happened to quite like to try understand. Does anyone else share a problem like this?
8	I feel this on a deep, existential level. I have a strong obsessive streak that I didn’t know was present until someone I was deeply in love with cut me out of their life completely. And no matter how much they ignored me or wouldn’t accept my calls, I still thought that maybe, just maybe, if I wallowed in my misery enough or thought about them enough or knew in my heart that we were meant together they would eventually reach out to me again. Obviously this was not the case. \n\nIt’s been a good while now and I still check up on them and think about them way too often but have reached a healthy level of acceptance that it is completely over. \n\nI suggest diving head first into something that is a healthy escape. I started working out and it has helped me immensely. Also, time and perspective changes everything. 
3	Yeah I’m still hung up over this one girl I know it’s over with.  I blew my opportunity with her so hard it’s hard for me to move on.
3	It sucks been dealing with for a long time and I say just try to meet people. That way you can find someone that does gives you the feeling and loves you back. 
3	Yeah. Working on getting over a complicated situation currently. Honestly, the biggest thing that helps me is reflecting on how quickly they entered and changed my life- because I know there are more wonderful people that will randomly enter my life in the future. \n\nFor now though, it sucks because I see parts of them-- what they taught me about life and myself and unique behaviors I adopted from spending a lot of time with them-- reflected in how I act on the daily. 
2	Yes sometimes I feel very emotionally unstable but I don’t appear to be so because I internalize it so well. For example, I feel really angry right now and had to really dig at myself to figure out why. 
1	Yes I find it very difficult to “get over” situations that emotionally affect me. The only thing that really helps is time. Sometimes a long extended period of time at that :/
14	Irrational fears	Do you guys have any irrational fears? Things that logically shouldn't make you afraid but they do? Idk why but ever since childhood I've been scared of wasps and bees, especially big ones. I still tend to unconsciously flinch/freak out every time they buzz in close proximity to me (no offense, bees).
5	Spiders and interacting with people I don't know well.\n\nBoth really suck to have :/
3	Same, fear of bees and wasps, even though my grandpa is a beekeeper and I have to help out during summer (meaning almost daily contact with those buzzing f*ckers).\nEdit: I mean I've been around them since childhood, I don't understand why I'm still so afraid of them :/
3	this started in elementary school and its been going on for about 9 or 10 years now. whenever i have to go in my front yard at night i'm terrified that a car will drive by and the driver will shoot me..its by far the most irrational fear i have lol. i can walk in other people's yard or walk in mine during the day but as soon as it's dark i get so afraid. it used to be such an overwhelming fear that i'd get panic attacks if i had to go out to my car or trash can. now its not nearly as bad but if i see a car i still have to either sprint back into my house or try hiding behind something so the driver can't see me and possibly shoot me. i honestly have no idea where this all started from and i know it makes absolutely no sense for me to be afraid but here i am lol 
3	Talking to most people my age or older. I fear being judged by my apparent maturity and being lectured about something I already know.
2	I fear large leaves (leaves bigger than my hand). It may be instincts or idk. I just cannot get near a piece of large leaf or those tropical plants (I'd freeze and want to cry) since the leaves are sooooo creepy and horrifying! Maybe its because I live in tropical places.
1	I had a bad phobia of museums for all of my childhood and I'm still not entirely sure why... Also had a fear of driving/cars, bugs, and thunderstorms. Had a fear of getting sick that got so bad it developed into an eating disorder (ARFID) and sent me to the hospital. I think it all stems from a fear of loosing control. 
1	Frogs. Roaches. Lizards.
1	Passing by a parked car and fearing that somebody/something will jump out of its windows or just appear suddenly in the windows.
1	I saw king Kong (with jack black) in the movie theater when I was 6 and was scared that cannibles were in the bathroom and hallways so I couldn't take a bath by myself. And also I was freaked out for a while worrying that my reflection would not move with me and would attempt to kill me. Because of the movie mirror. This was sophomore year in high school and the fear comes back evey now and then. Up until that year I was afraid of the dark. And I was really interested in learning about aliens and was constantly fearing they would abduct me.
6	Isfp protagonists in movies	Based on my opinion- \n\nTom Holland in The Impossible and Spider-Man Homecoming.\nJohn Travolta in Phenomenon.\nJessica Alba in Into The Blue. \nJohn Francis Daley in Freak & Geeks.\n\n\n\nAny other good films/shows out there with isfp’s? They all seem to carry this theme of authenticity that just resonates strongly with me
11	Patrick Star from SpongeBob. Lazy, unassuming, sensitive, and hilarious :D
4	Spiderman is usually INFP but I'm homecoming he does seem different.
3	Newt from Fantastic Beasts. Not that I love the idea of it but let's face it JKR is probably isfp as well
3	Virgil from The Abyss. A very strong Fi dom leader and protagonist. I highly recommend the extended director's edition because it has much better character development that was cut out in the theatrical version.
3	T’chala Black Panther
4	I can name two istjs mistyped as isfps\n- rey, star wars - istj mistyped as isfp\n- ichigo, bleach - istj mistyped as isfp\n\nBottomline, mbti type in fiction is dumb.  Has no bearing on anything what so ever.  It’s not real and we try to identify with characters that are well written and likable no matter what type we are.  Be the best person you can be, not a fictional character
2	Harry Potter and Attack on Titan are my favorites. Attack on titan season 3 is coming out. The isfp from aot turned into this really calculating and genius guy in the recent manga spoilers too
2	Not a movie, but for readers of the Mondo Mango webcomic and/or Name Pending, I get ISFP vibes from CK.
3	Harry Potter.
5	Academic Survey on Personality	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
1	fyi you need a student ID number to apply for the gift card.
15	ISFPs, how do you manage to spend so much time in solitude without getting restless?	I feel like Isfp’s are literally the missing link in what makes me a better person. Whenever I find myself in their company, I notice that I am much more comfortable being quiet and in solitude. But to an extent, it makes me feel down and alone. \n\nI notice that I can think through things much better, but it’s as if I’m isolated from everyone else in the world. Do y’all get this feeling? What’s it like being an introverted Fi/Se user?
15	It is a matter of we are very in tune with our feelings and internalize a lot. For me I've meet only one person that makes feel like a true extrovert and I draw engery being around her. We listen and observe mostly. Depending on the person we are not very judging by our nature. We listen and speak with compassion and honesty that's why you feel. Comfortable 
11	Whenever I hear about solitary confinement, I actually think to my self, “what’s so bad with that. I could get a lot done.”
5	Functionally, ISFPs have PoLR Ne; so essentially, they *are* kind of disconnected from everyone else in the world. (It doesn't sound as bad to us as it probably does to everyone else. Think of some nature lover living in a hut in the middle of a forest. I personally thought of Aurora. (Also disclaimer, ISFPs are various and for some PoLR Ne might manifest differently than it does for others)) Plus the Si demonstrative offers a lot of comfort in everyday living, despite having adventurous Se in there too. When you're alone and in solitude you can indulge in your individualistic ideas and imagination easier than when you're around others (speaking for myself, at least). I can do simple errands and not get bored, as long as they are done relatively fast or there's not too much to do. I prefer there to freedom while doing stuff/not be overly systematic or organized.
4	I actually do get restless when alone for long periods of time. I used to spend a lot of time alone before, but I decided to change that and now I always try to have people around me. It makes me feel better having others (people I like) around me. Sometimes I do need a break from everyone, but only if I’m overwhelmed or need to clear my head.
4	I suppose being introverted helps when it comes to being alone. Although I don't see this topic as a Myers-Briggs issue...all humans should learn to live and be completely comfortable in their own company. I think it's extremely healthy to be able to do so. I also think it has nothing to do with the amusement of these "personality types". I think most people who take the Myers-Briggs get too wrapped up in them. They are not really scientifically accurate so being comfortable by ones self is just a human trait, not solely for any "personality type". I am an isfp when it comes to the test but I'm not that simple. Lol. None of us are. We all share traits, no one is so ridged and clean cut to just act within a single, non scientific "personality trait". Just my two cents. 
2	I just internalize all crap, maybe not too healthy, but whatever.
2	I definitely do get restless and need to be around others. Even though I'm introverted I still need to communicate and be social. Isolation is not fun to me at all.
6	The Present, Happiness, and MBTI Types	The present is a gift, and it brings happiness. If we focus on the past or future too much, we miss it. This has made me wonder...\n\nWhat's a healthy amount of present-orientedness for each type? Are some personality types destined to be happier than others? When should we focus on the present? If life is about the journey, not the destination, are some types destined to miss out on life?
3	Leading questions! And yes to all!\n\nHappiest types are Ne and Se users. Se users are happiest living in the present. Technically I ought to be missing out on life, because I’m so future oriented -but strangely enough, I don’t care. The present is not a happy place for me. It’s a dangerous, nerve-wracking place, full of stuff that can go wrong if I take one wrong step. I’m happiest living in the future, and my present is bearable, because I planned my way here.\n\nBy the same logic, I’d say Si users are happier living in the past, but don’t take that from me.\n\nEdit: You forgot one more -Ne users live in multiple dimensions XD
4	Queer ISFPs	Hey you guys or gals. Wlw INTP here and I am wondering about how ISFPs come to terms with being queer. How long did it take? What possibly triggered it? How do you feel about the subject now? (Bonus points if you're a fellow wlw)\n\nI hope I haven't offended anyone by asking such questions but I know that everyone's coming out experience is not the same and would like to know about what possibly goes on in someone else's head.
3	Several people I’ve met during middle/highschool all told me it was pretty obvious I was the gay one even though I never asked anyone out directly during that time. Turns out Im the only one oblivious to my actions  at least until around 20 when I (what it feels like) suddenly had my brain expanded and started thinking about what kind of person I’ve grown into and what kind of person I aspire to become. Before that I mostly observed others and thought about their motives, rarely analyzing my own. \n\nOnce it was clear to me I was over the label pretty quickly. Having the need to identify with a certain group of people or community just feels like a nuance, I’d rather let people know me by how I act instead of giving them a list of nouns/adjectives that I want others to think of me as.\n\nAnyways, the realization was liberating and I dont feel awkward for loving others anymore, male or female. 
3	To be honest, only a few people know of my bisexuality. I didn't think much of it when I was a kid, and only in college did I actually meet people who are open with their sexuality. I always found thrill in watching yuri anime though in high school, and once or twice I got quite attracted to some of my girl friends. So in college I met this intp (he is a trans boy but he didnt tell me about it yet of course, and physically he's still female). He intrigued me so and I was always very aware of him whenever he's around. I shrugged the feelings off because I've never thought about being together with a girl before. We grew close, and it kinda developed. I couldn't deny it anymore. Little did I know he was feeling the same and we got together the summer before our 3rd year in college started. He came out as trans before we got together, and my feelings decided it doesn't really care. Well I got attracted to him not knowing he was trans, so pretty much I got attracted to him as a girl, but when he told me he was actually a boi I decided it didn't really matter. That's when I realised why I seem to get butterflies back then when I steal fleeting glances at women. But when I start to ponder about it my attraction to other people actually goes beyond them being either male or female. I like them for who they are, and up until now I am conflicted with the term 'bisexual' but I still use it for lack of a better term, although 'queer' might be better. I don't know, hahah! There's still a lot to realise.\n\nThis might be a very boring story, this post isn't even asking for a love story holy shite, but that intp of mine has been a pivotal part of my life. My life has been a blur and an endless coming of going until him. He's my breath of fresh air.
2	Hey fellow queer lady here! \nI feel that deep down I always knew I was queer however, I pushed it aside and thought it was something I didn’t need to deal with until I was older. I was 18 when I came out to my friends, and it was when I settled in at university. I found fellow queer friends and also the people I was surrounded with were chill af, so everything went smoothly once I figured out my sexuality. I was absolutely certain when I drunkenly kissed one of my uni friends on my birthday. Something clicked in my head and It was like fireworks went off and I had found the missing puzzle piece. After that - being all excited and happy that I’d found myself - I experimented, before settling in with my long term girlfriend. \nI struggled to deal with being queer in high school quite a lot because I kept thinking ‘but what if I do like guys and I just haven’t found a one I’m attracted to’. I knew I was definitely attracted to girls but I didn’t know entirely what my sexuality was. I also couldn’t really judge how my friends would react to me coming out because they were all female, never really expressed any views and one of them was a devout Christian. I thought maybe I’d make them feel incredibly uncomfortable or something. \n\nFast forward to 2 years after my uni graduation and I have a girlfriend who I live with and I’ve come out to my high school friends and my family. Everyone is incredibly accepting of me, and happy for me. I have one aunt who is uncomfortable with it but I don’t see her often and she’s outnumbered by my accepting family members. Everything is great and I am comfortable and happy with being a queer lady. Overall I think the biggest struggle for me was thinking about what people would think of me if they knew, but once I overcame that and found the right group of friends, I am confident, happy and as queer as can be. :) \n\nEdit: (also my girlfriend is an INTP :))
1	Not sure if queer or if I just get a kick out of my best friend's reaction when my other friends tease our 'bromance' XD 
8	Understanding ISFP	Hi ISFP community!\n\nNew user here - please bear with me if I have done any form of mistakes here, still pretty fresh with the rules and all.\n\nSo recently I have known an ISFP, and I'm just trying to get close with her as a friend. Y'all are hella interesting and goofy and has this particular charm that sucks me in.\n\nI want to get to know her better, but I seriously got no idea how to start. I've thought of directing questions I'm curious of to her, but I'm just afraid that she may feel that I'm trying to invade her privacy/life, make her feel uncomfortable and the last thing I want to do is to scare her off from my life. (+ It is really hard to read her throughout my years on knowing her) \n\nOn top of this, I have social anxiety issues so when it comes to even talking to people, I'm like at the level of pit bottom. I think I also need to clarify that I have a tiny slight crush on her, so unsurprisingly her existence itself manages to make my brain malfunction whenever we hang out alone.\n\nJust a background clarification if it matters:\nI am an INFP (enneagram 6w5) with horrible social anxiety and conversation skills. \n\nSo I need advice from you guys:\n- Are you guys able to advice on any kind of ways I can approach her?\n- What are the signs of intimacy you guys usually show when it comes to friends and what are the differences of treatment you do between acquaintances and friends (or maybe close friends)\n\nSorry if there are any forms of grammar/vocab error!
3	Just treat her like you’d treat anybody else.  Ask her about her interests, what she likes to do and try to plan to do something with her
3	Just communicate as normally as you can, and as for the crush just be straightforward about how you feel overall. Not just the fact that you like her, but what youre kind of confused about with that
3	I absolutely love when people express their thoughts and intentions with me. I pick up on social cues sometimes but I’m afraid I misinterpret them so when someone is clear in what they mean by something then it helps me a lot. But the best thing is when I’m invited to do things and hangout with someone and get to know them more personally. So I’d advise doing that!Just focus on being friends and showing her you care by little things! Eventually the little things will start to add up and she’ll have this massive realization. Maybe. 
3	I advice you get to know her slowly and steadily. Initiate the talking, remember the little things. \nApproach : Get to know her passion, hobby, once you hit the topic, she'll be v charismatic. Don't forget to talk about your passion too! We like to listen. (Me, personally.) \n\nSigns of intimacy : I usually feel intimate and comfortable with the person when I can look them straight in the eyes. Difference? My humor only shines through with my close friends. With acquaintances, I don't really bother to make a comment on anything. \n\n
3	I can’t say for certain because I’m a Ti/Fe user BUT, Id imagine you will be much more perceptive of her attraction towards you than others since you are both Fi users. In my experience, honesty and intimacy comes from their actions, so you may find yourself totally uncertain if they’re attracted to you based on what they say in words.It may not be till you get that surprise hug that you realize their true disposition towards you. Isfp’s are touchy-feely. Don’t overlook what’s happening physically in the moment (since INFPs have a tendency to do this). \n\n\nBest wishes 
2	Talk with her, talk about yourself and ask her questions. Find some common ground and show that you're interested to listen to her talking about her passions.\nUsually if I'm interested to know someone and if that person is introvert I would even take the first step (even though I'm shy, introvert and social anxious too, I feel you so much mate), but I desperately need some cooperation because socialising is my worst skill and there's always the risk to end up in those akward moments of silence...\nMy signs of intimacy are: being more talkative than usual, talking about my passions (usually I'm very private with this BUT if there's some common ground that's the end because I would talk just about that), talking about the stupid things that happened the other day, usually I show my silly side and I'm all smiles and laughs.\nClose friends are those people who realise how dumb and not-so-cute I can be, acquaintances usually sees me as a kind, reliable and shy girl. So, in a way, if she shows you her "worst" sides then it means that she feels very comfortable with you.\n

9	Identity relationships	Has anyone on here been in a relationship with another ISFP? If so, how did it go? What issues would one need to work on for such a relationship to work?\n\nI ask because right now (and for the past year or two) I've been completely infatuated by this girl who I'm pretty sure is an ISFP; she got ESFP on 16p but she said that's more like what she aspires to be and that she identifies more with ISFP.\nWe met online and are on opposite ends of the earth yet I can't stop thinking about her and how she 'gets me' in a way that none of my local friends do.\nOur situation is a little bit odd in that I've told her that I have a crush on her and she didn't outright reject me, but she didn't accept either. She said that she didn't know how she felt about me in that way and we agreed not to make any advances until we meet in real life. Which is fair enough, I am aware that I'm probably imagining her as more perfect than she actually is due to the nature of the Internet and online messaging.\nBut like I said, I can't stop thinking about her and can't help but wonder what it would be like if we were together.
10	One great thing about being with another isfp is it’s incredibly emotionally satisying.  It’s great to be with girls that feel as deeply as I do
2	I won't have an educated opinion on what it is like dating an ISFP as am ISFP because I am an ENFP but I can tell you that you better stop fantasizing because something impossible is about to affect you in the here and now. You might oversee opportunities because you compare real people to the romanticized version of a girl you will not get together with (sorry). 
1	Identical type relationships can start out great but fizzle out fast as it is too much of the same kind of deal. They are usually based on a sense of sympathy between identicals and often start to feel like a sibling friendship especially if there is some age difference. You can read more about idential relationships on [this page](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/114-Identical-Relations).    \nAnd the complete [**relationships-by-type guide for ISFPs**](http://personalitycafe.com/isfp-articles/288-love-types-isfp-11.html#post22271698)
8	What is going on in this ISFP mind?	My ISFP has not yet presented me to his parents, but on rare occasions when the conversation goes into that direction he thinks they would like me (INFJ).I found out that his mother likes a particular location (where I have already been, and loved it) and bought a book for her, about this place. The ISFP knows it and while he does not encourage me to send it to her (via post), he lets me do what I want. The way he put it is if I want to show him the note that I want to write as a dedication to his mother, it is only after I have already posted it and there is nothing he could change about it. Does he just like living on the edge or he would actually know his mother to know that he is well and happy with someone but not through him? What do you guys think?
3	I wouldn't advise sending a present to someone you haven't even met yet. Hold your horses.
5	How do I Stop Pussy-Footing?	I'm wanting to take right action (think of that "Just do it!" meme or breaking from routine but not making the new thing a one-time thing), but I pussy foot my way around it. It's like trying to run into a cold shower. You work yourself up and run in there like William Wallace, but then you run away like a pussy. There's a barrier in the way.\n\nI think just "being" by emptying my mind with no goal and being present-oriented should work, but the question is how do I become present-oriented? How do you do something with no goal in mind? What's the purpose of doing something with no goal in mind?\n\nI found this, but it doesn't exactly explain how to enter the state of mind (Introduction, Defining "Action", and 5 Actions to Becoming an Action-Taker will give you the gist of it):\nhttps://startupbros.com/overthinkers-guide-taking-action-complete-guide/\n\nI'm an INTP by the way. Ti-Ne-Si, especially Ne-Si, is a bitch when it comes to breaking from routine. It's good at building routine, but what happens is you adapt and then get stuck. Ne is the "In a sec" function while Si is the conservative "must make no mistakes" function. Ne can take action, but it just chases reward and only does so if it gets it soon and if little to no conscious effort is required. Si can take action if it's routine.
3	There isn't a "how" component to "just do it" -- it's the opposite of figuring out the steps and reasons and purpose and strategy and justification and explanation, etc etc. It sounds to me like you're trying to solve your overthinking issue by thinking about it even more. \n\nBeing present-oriented doesn't mean you don't have any goals. If the idea of a looming goal paralyzes you, then maybe it'd help to suspend the end goal in favour for a smaller one that you can deal with **now**. Just as an example: for me, the thought of failing can be overwhelming at times, especially when I'm trying something new. What helps me is to treat what I need to do as data-gathering (questions can come *after*. does this approach work? why, why not? what's a better way?), rather than a straight-up attempt at success. This is just what works for me; it takes a lot of the inner pressure off. You gotta find what works for you. Keep on trying.
2	Figure out what you want to do. That's your goal. Now have that at the back of your mind without thinking about the details of what exactly that would entail. As long as you know it's not going to hurt you significantly if you fail, worrying about specifics will only get in the way of putting things in motion. If you need to think about something, thing about something unrelated to the task at hand, or suppress your Ne by observing physical things with Se (not sure how well this would work for you but that's how I do it). That's the best I can explain for "entering the state of mind" of present-oriented action taking.\n\nUsing the cold shower analogy, this is how I'd do it. I know I want to go in the shower, but thinking about going in there makes me shiver and hesitate. I shake my head to reset my train of thought and focus on the sound of the running water. That's all I'm thinking about, just the white noise of drops steadily hitting the tile. I take a step towards the shower. My mind switches focus to my leg, but I'm still not thinking about the temperature of the water. I start walking into the shower, my mind focusing on the rhythm of my steps until I'm in the shower. *Fuck*, it's cold, but I'm in here now so coming out would be a waste of all the effort it took to get in, so I force myself to endure the pain. Eventually my body adapts and the cold no longer stings. Mission accomplished.
2	At least for things you can't back out of once you start (asking someone out, signing up for something, etc.), you should only need to convince yourself to do the first step. Don't think "I'm going to ask my crush out now" think "I'm going to say hi and ask if they've ever been to x place." Once you've started something like that the path of least resistance becomes to continue.
11	I'm weird about love	Yesterday my ex contacted me (after 3 months of not talking to each other). I was surprised, but also relieved for reasons I couldn't explain. I thought I didn't want him anymore, but at that time I wanted to do nothing but talk to him. I was in a low mood. He said to me that he was worried about me and wanted to know how I was doing. It didn't seem like he had any bitter/resentful thoughts towards me. Still, when we talked again it was like we had never stopped talking. There was that same intense feeling of fondness towards him. I was so glad at that time. I appreciated his concern towards me, and truthfully I still appreciate him. But I just can't figure out my feelings towards him?? It's like I consider him as a close friend, but at that moment I felt love, but was it platonic love? I don't think it was. I don't think it was romantic either? I think it was somewhere in between. I felt that same closeness when I had been talking to him (texting) earlier. I feel like I shouldn't abandon him, but I also don't want to run into his arms declaring I would never leave him. It's like I'm really glad he's in my life but I still want to keep him at an arms length. He said that he would like to meet me again, but only if I wanted to. I can't figure out the "do I want" part. Does anyone else relate to indecisiveness when it comes to romantic feelings? Do you think my issue with him stems from incompatibility or something else? Am I being a horrible romantic partner? I feel like I should be honest towards my feelings here, and I also feel like he wants me to do the same. Anyways thanks for reading this romantic rant.\n\nedit: I think I found my problem, which is that I'm trying to label things too much. Still, it feels weird.
8	You’re not weird about love at all.  The push/pull you feel towards this guy is perfectly normal.  This is someone you dated and had feelings for.  Obviously you’re going to have mixed emotions talking to him again.  And that’s ok!  Love is a complicated mess and usually doesn’t totally make sense.  Just take some time to process things and do whatever you think is right
1	Maybe you don't trust him anymore
3	Isfp vs Esfp	Hey lovelies, what do you think about Esfps?  I personally thought I was one, and tested as one every time.  But function stack-wise I’m definitely an Isfp.  And reading descriptions of how Esfps process things, being entirely in the moment, I couldn’t relate at all.  But behavior wise, I relate way more to Esfps.  In fact the Isfp descriptions kind of make me cringe.  But weirdly when I look at celebrity Isfps or self typed Isfps in real life, it’s like looking in a mirror personality wise.  Idk can anyone relate?  I feel like Esfps and Isfps are the most different from each other in terms of introverted/extroverted types, but I can see aspects of both within me.
3	One of my best friends is esfp. I think I would have identified with esfp more when I was younger (but not with those awful descriptions  that seem like something unhealthy exxps in general would do (partying, being shallow, being aggressive)). What I've noticed is the extroversion/ introversion differences. My friend LOVES being around people, developing good feelings in groups, going out and having adventures. I used to be like that but now that I am more introverted, I hate being around strangers, I get tired easily when I go outside, I have a more wary and negative view towards people, and I love my house. My esfp friend actually told me how sad she would be when she was alone at home. And this:\n>"And reading descriptions of how Esfps process things, being entirely in the moment, I couldn’t relate at all"\n\nThey say that about all sensors, especially esfp and estp. But of course, esfp and estp can plan ahead. They just aren't constantly planning ahead like NJ types. There are too sides to it: planning ahead constantly that you never get anything done, and never planning ahead and being inefficient. Of course, all types need to find the middle ground.\n
2	I always have like a mild attraction toward esfps, but I'm usually disappointed by what appears to be their lack of foresight or consideration.   Not sure if that's just the few I've known though?  And not sure if the attraction is genuine or more that I wish I was bolder and better with people like they are, ha--  but would want to keep my other characteristics at the same time..
9	isfp crush	Just a little rant, maybe you can share some insights with me. \n\nMy isfp crush keeps going for these gossipy shallow but flirty and confident girls. I know one of his previous crushes was on a real bitch who said mean things about me behind my back (called me useless) while another gave me a mean stare. They both act really shallow like I said and I can see them being mean to others too. He got rejected by both. \n\nI dont think that he is compatible with those girls at all, if they get into a relationship I'm pretty sure he will end up being a pushover. They are not good for someone sensitive and soft hearted like him. However I can see why he would be attracted to girls like that, they display a certain power that he doesnt and they are on the surface very bubbly and happy\n\nHe has a history with feeling worthless and sometimes depressed but I think its improved. Sometimes I think that he needs to grow up a bit and choose girls who are more compatible. \n\nHes someone Im very attracted to but I prefer to be a good friend to him as he is because thats the best I can do for him. I hope that he is able to find someone to be happy with though and when he does Ill support it. We are both 21 y/o
7	Can’t speak for him, but for me, I don’t really care if a girl I like doesn’t get along with one of my friends.  It sorta sucks but it’s hardly a deal breaker.  I also tend to like confident, aggressive girls because I don’t like being the one making all the moves.  
8	Very likely: You chose the wrong man. He's the sexy body you currently desire, but he's not actually a good idea for a long-term bond. Many girls make that same mistake.
3	I feel like feeling worthless is pretty common for 21 years old nowadays. Fresh out of college and most likely unemployed or working a shit job that someone can do with just a high school education would do that. \n\nNothing anyone say or do will change them, not until they actually start doing something they are passionate about which might take a few years.  \n\nAlso it sounds to me like you want to be his friend just to be close to him. And tbh if the feeling is mutual he wouldnt go out and try to find other girls while you are around. I would suggest you stop worry about his choice in dates and decide if you are actually his friend because you care about him and not because you are infatuated with him, dont become a “nice guy”.

47	"their entire existence is a movie and they are the audience behind their eye sockets"	Found this amazing quote in a random ISFP profile and it hit *so* close to home.  I've always viewed the world in this outsider/alien type of way, but was never able to articulate it.  It's incredibly accurate for me.  Behold:\n\n***"When it comes down to it, ISFP’s are naturally designed observers.  ISFP’s live their life always engaged in observation, like their entire existence is a movie and they are the audience behind their eye sockets.  Other types might find this to be a horrible existence, never being directly involved in life, but to the ISFP, the best experiences are the ones most people don’t even notice until they take a step back from all  the action."***   \n\nI'll admit it's a lonely feeling.  It's almost as if I'm never really experiencing reality in the present moment, but rather watching it all unfold from an outside, third person perspective. However, I believe the *upside* to this unique "watcher" perspective is that it allows us to notice all the subtleties and nuances that many others may completely miss. These subtleties and nuances are sometimes more special than the experience itself.\n\nCan you dudes relate?
8	Wow. Very relatable quote. I’ve always felt some sort of depersonalization and this really sums it up
7	Can relate, I always think of myself as some sort of character from a first person game, I don't really think too much about myself and instead I'm almost exclusively focused on what happens on the outside.
6	Oh, totally. Sometimes I forget I'm in a situation until someone addresses me directly.
3	This is crazy accurate. Thanks for sharing! 
3	This is indeed very accurate. Nice. I always thought about this as one of my best qualities while viewing myself rather negatively.
3	Reminds me of when I was younger and I'd play a game with myself where I'd pretend I'm in a game of the sims and in my head I'd picture a top\-down view of my house or wherever I was and imagine giving myself commands and watch as I do seemingly mundane things. I swear I wasn't as lonely as that makes it sound lol
1	Wow, thank you for this! This is scarily relatable. Great to know there are many others with this outlook!
10	A few questions to you precious isfp's out there	Do you have a passion, something you would go to the end of the world for if you could do it for a living?\n\nDo you like talking about your strengths? For example for a job interview.\n\nWhat do you do if you need to be confident?\n\nEDIT: Why isn't there some flowery pattern in your subreddit banner
4	...oh! hey, thanks ( *° -° )/\n\nI do have a passion, it's art... sounds stereotypical, I know. Cosplay, dancing, photography, photo shoots, digital art, performing, sewing, piano... I've wanted to do all these things at some point in my life. So, something related to those. And also to a lesser extent helping/some kind of service duty. And nature and animals too. \n\nI don't like talking about my strengths, because I can't exactly pinpoint what they are... haha. Not at least when asked to on the spot. For a job interview it's a different thing of course... \n\nWhat do I do to be confident? Man, these are kinda good questions. Haven't thought about that. I guess I become more engaging, attentive, serious and thoughtful about my answers. \n\nAnd about the ISFP banner... I think there'd been a post for a new banner, but don't know what happened to that... It'd be nice if there was one though. (We just have to get our lazy asses up once again(!?)I know, it's troublesome)\n\n...eh. have a nice week
4	I'm a big fan of theatrical lighting, we'll see how that changes after I start doing it on a much higher level in university, but right now it's something that can get me more excited than most anything else.\n\nLike /u/eoufdeesh said, I also generally can't come up with anything when asked to describe myself or my strengths. When I can, I tend to heavily undersell myself, that way I don't disappoint anyone. I'd rather have my ability to do something end up being a surprise.\n\nUsually if I need to be confident it either happens on its own, or it doesn't at all.
4	I guess my passion would be literature and analysing literature texts. I'm into philosophy too but I'm taking music. (I unexpectedly find myself enjoying when I sing so yeah.)\n\nWhen I'm asked to describe myself I can't come up with anything at all. I don't know what to say. I never really stopped to think about things and when I am asked, well, I don't know. (Haha)\n\nI'm a vocal performance major and that means I have to have a fuckton of confidence. What I do is basically just tell myself how I haven't managed to fuck up so far so what difference does it make this time? I focus on what I have to do too. Decide on the results/output that I want and have to produce and how I'm going to do it. When my mindset has switched to that I block everything else and just think that I just have to do. There's no time for lollygagging AT ALL.\n\nI like looking at flowers. They're pretty. They make useful symbolisms for poetry too but I don't really spend too much time on reddit to edit that. LOL
3	Although I haven't found my one true passion, I love working with my hands for intricate crafts. 
3	I havent found a passion but i like drawing and making music sometimes.\n\nIm pretty good at coming off as charming and confident for job interviews and stuff. I dont really believe that i have the strengths that i say i have but I can keep the facade up for about 30 minutes lol. \n\nYoure right we should have a cool banner or something.
3	*Do you have a passion, something you would go to the end of the world for if you could do it for a living?*  \nNot really. Maybe go on adventures with my friends. Or have a little family/homestead. \n  \n*Do you like talking about your strengths? For example for a job interview.*  \nI'm ok with giving facts, but I might not be aware of my strengths/limitations.  \n  \n*What do you do if you need to be confident?*  \nSocially? Warm-up (voice, body). If it's for an interview: be prepared (i.e. have relevant skills/experience), know that I would be useful and not a burden.
1	yes i do, music composition. i really want to be a professional performer and wish i was better with the technical aspects of playing instruments.\n\ni do NOT like talking about my strengths. i feel simultaneously worse and better at everything than others and compare myself to them constantly, so it's not that i can't think of strengths, but i don't like the idea of my boss getting high expectations and then being disappointed. i would rather impress people by doing better than they expected.\n\nif i need to be confident i pretend i'm a fictional character that is confident. it's very easy for me to project mental states of characters or people i've known. it works too.
1	Do I have a passion? Not in the typical sense, but I am extremely passionate about helping people. I'm a firm believer that everyone needs someone, and if I can be that someone, I generally want to be. This can be emotionally draining sometimes though if I dont lower my expectations and acknowledge that I probably wont get the same treatment in return.\n\nTalking about my strengths is honestly really difficult. But I think it's because I see my strengths as weaknesses as well. It's super confusing because isfp's can be very aware of all sides in a situation. So where my compassion may be seen as a strength sometimes, it's definitely a weakness at other times and so trying to only see it as a strength just isn't really possible for me.\n\nFor an interview. it reaaaaaally helps me to have an understanding of the job I am interviewing for beforehand. Some positions need a certain set of strengths, so if I know what the position requires, I can typically focus on just that one side of my characteristic and talk about it being only a strength. \n\nI personally dont have issues with needing confidence as I am fairly confident already. I'll typically only need that boost if I'm doing something that makes me uncomfortable, which is usually talking to groups of random people. That's when I'll use the whole "fuck it, what's the worst that's going to happen?: I dont get the job? I fart in front of a stranger? I trip and fall?\n\nDamn, that was way wordier than I wanted.\n\n
1	My passions are literature, languages, tv series, books.\n\nI've read through the other answers and I saw that no one likes to talk about their strengths, but actually I think that I've come to some kind of self knowledge (?) so I can easily say what I'm good at and what I'm bad at.\n\nConfident? Uhm, I don't know ahah\nMaybe I think that it's time to stop being weak, that I know my value and that I should stay relaxed, even if I got it wrong at least I tried, there will be another occasion. Now the question is if this self-persuasion really works...
27	Finally found a nice isfp-ish job	I just started as an animal caretaker at a pet shop and after a few years of working food service and retail this job is a breath of fresh air.\n\n The first thing i noticed was the difference in the vibe of my co workers. Everyones more introverted and calm, no gregarious high energy people that i have to feel pressured to make conversation with. The whole day was mostly quiet except for fish tanks bubbling and birds singing.\n\nIts also a very low stress job. You have to be timely of course but you dont have to feel rushed and stressed out with multitasking. As long as you get everything done before its time to leave youre good. \n\nThe best part is its in the back away from the customers so you never have to put on a customer service persona.\n\nIf you dont mind doing a lot of cleaning this job is the most fitting job ive found and its also really rewarding to know youre directly improving the lives of small creatures. If youre having trouble as an isfp finding a minimum wage job you like i recommend this one.\n\n
11	Great! It's a good feeling to find your place in the world. I'm trying to find mine, so I envy you.\n\nI hope this comfy place you found can help you become grounded and ready for more adventures to come!
6	A low pressure job, where I don't have to talk to anyone, and I get to hang around animals all day?\n\nUmmm when can I apply 😆
3	Very cool, the part about not having to put a customer service persona sounds very appealing... bonus points if it's a low stress job. I'll definitely be considering it in the future. Thanks for the recommendation!
2	Wow I wish I knew about this in high school/college :( sounds way better than the summer jobs I've been doing!
10	Who is attracted to you?	Are you male? Female? Which types of people (MBTI or not) are attracted to you?
46	Is this some kind of a sick joke 
9	I'm male and the women who tend to be attracted to me are usually not very sure of themselves. Over the years I've sorta learned to extravert feeling (you mean people can't just feel my loving nature?) and have become something of a quiet encourager, I think. Oddly, bossy cougar types like me too, but the liking is not mutual.
5	I'm male, and the females that I end up dating \(Not sure of their MBTI types \- btw which MBTI types are most aware of their own MBTI personality type?\) are typically loud, outgoing, dominate conversations, active, stubborn, and passionate... not sure what that says about me.. haha.
3	Who knows!?
3	Female \n\n\n\nNot gonna lie, most people, men and women alike are attracted to me as friends and sometimes romantically. Usually TJs and TPs like me romantically not sure if that’s just because they’re common or if something about ISFPs draw them in. 
2	Women 3-4 years older are very into me! 21 year olds are into me physically but not for long term
2	My fiancé is very active/restless (always trying to improve the house), sweet, comfortable being in charge, and very friendly with other people. Makes me feel kinda weird saying bye to someone after she ends a conversation and I realize I haven't said a word. 
2	Fi types usually attract Te types, and Se is attractive for Ni, so ISFPs often attract INTJs, INFJs, ENTJs, ESTJs, and ISTJs and feel attracted to ENFPs due to "supervision" relation: [**Types for ISFP relationships**](http://personalitycafe.com/isfp-articles/288-love-types-isfp-11.html#post22271698)
1	Male\n\nNo one I’ve ever been aware of. I’m 23 virgin never even kissed a girl. I’ve asked a few out but always got a no. I’ve pretty much given up completely at this point. It’ll never happen. I’m overweight and have depression and anxiety. Who who ever want me?
1	a lot of te types lately have been attracted to me, 2 intjs and a entj.
1	overwhelming majority are ESFP females. but i don't get along well with ESFPs in the long run because of our differences it is a shame that we are opposites in all forms of the MBTI.   im not blaming MBTI  but im just stating that we communicate differently. 
6	How do you guys get over trauma?	I'm pretty sure my sister is an ISFP. It isn't confirmed though. Her life has been so horrible. Ever since she was young she had an abusive father, to getting married to a man who she had a tumultuous relationship with. There was one event that really pushed her over the edge when her husband kind of left. Even after he came back she was never the same. It's like the trauma changed her. She wasn't the same person since then. It's been years and there are moments I see the same light inside that I loved before but it's like she's gone. It's such a bad situation because in some way I feel she could just get better with family but she pushes the ones who want to be with her away, and the others are so busy with their own lives and find it hard to spend so much time with her. I don't even know of this is what will help her. So how would you guys get over a trauma like this? Even if you don't know. Do you guys have any help in this situation? She is also smoking so much, she over eats, and sometimes throws it up purposefully, and she doesn't keep that clean. We have tried to get her to some psychological help or even a doctor but she refuses and it's really hard to get her to go there. So what do you guys think?
6	a while ago i read a book called The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. i wouldn't advise reading it in order to help her because it's basically a medically oriented thesis on why trauma is so physical and emotional in nature that mentally-focused talk therapy alone doesn't resolve PTSD, but the basic premise was helpful to me because it got me to stop analyzing events and my reactions to them and instead deal with emotions of anger and fear in things like sports, archery, gaming, art, basically just anything physical. even smoking weed, eating, having sex, cuddling, getting massages helped because it's like i was replacing negative physical experiences with positive ones. but i had to have the intention to actually release negative feelings, not just distract myself from them, which did require feeling them.\n\ni think the best thing you can do is tell her that you love her and that you respect and value her as a person, and show this in your behavior. trauma can kind of mess up or eradicate your sense of self (especially in BPD) and it's important to rebuild that.
4	Truthfully I handle trauma in much the same way - not very well. I have had several major losses in my life and I carry them all with me to this day, to some extent.\n\nI do have a therapist but she is one in a million, extremely kind and empathetic. It has to be the right person. Most therapists I have been to were as clinical as a can of Lysol. If your sister found the right fit, she might actually want to go.
2	You said that your sister refuses to see a psychologist. How about a therapist who specializes in trauma? There are some agencies who will provide this kind of service for free or at a reduced cost. \n\nI bet your sister feels hopeless, attacked, and like you view her as broken. Have you talked to her? Like really talkd to her and learned how she makes sense of everything?
2	I mostly handle trauma by ignoring it until it becomes too much to handle.  Which is pretty much where I’m at right now in my life.  Very unpleasant
2	I’m still learning how. At 23 after a life of emotional neglect and abuse from my family I’ve had a suicide attempt been hospitalized and diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I’m fragile and broken but trying to get better. I see a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist monthly. The meds and therapy help but I’m a pathetic crumbling human being and I often wish I was just dead so that I could stop the pain. I think about it every night. 
9	I'm passionate about so many hobbies and I'm finding that the ones I obsess over "repress" all the others.	I have so many hobbies.\n\nComputers, Photography, Hifi Audio, Weaving, Woodworking, Music, Wrist Watches, Video Games, Mechanical Keyboards and probably a few more at some point.\n\nMy discovery of wearing a watch has recently taken over my brain. I haven't been taking many photos at all recently because it's just turning spring and winter was boring outside this year.\n\nHonestly I could sit here and type ten paragraphs trying to explain all of my hobbies but I won't. I believe that this is all just the result of my brain grasping for creative outlook while I'm currently in a boring rut in my life (working a boring job that's not in my field). I have nothing to complain about in my life other than the fact that being content with my hobbies is difficult when your personality craves precision and emotional peace. \n\nI'm in a wonderful relationship with a beautiful and understanding INFP (thank the karma gods). I graduate college in a month. I'm awaiting a response from a promising job interview so I can leave my under-appreciating retail job. I have nice possessions but ofc I consider selling them to get nicer options. I'm only content with about a half of my possessions and it makes me feel silly but oh well, I like having nice things.\n\nDon't mind me, I'm just trying to grasp my thoughts around understanding why I am the way I am. That understanding is temporary of coarse.\n\nWhat a great personality type. I love who I am but I am constantly reminded how thin the line that my sanity travels on actually is. Hi friends    
3	[deleted]
2	"What a great personality type" This made me smile and my day didn't start well, so thank you. :\) I have almost the same hobbies but something is stopping me from having fun with them, so I don't even do it and just sit around and watch Netflix.\n\nI wish you luck in getting the new job, I know very well how depressing it is to work in a field you dislike.
2	[deleted]
6	Does anyone else crave sub-textual communication?	I'm an ISFP and I crave subtext, I feel more drawn to people and have the strongest connections with people who pick up on communicating this way and reciprocate, but I don't come across this that often. Does anyone else find themselves craving sub\-textual communicaton? On a side \(or maybe related note\) I'm also a chronic winker. 
4	[deleted]
1	HMU yo maybe i'm not an expert in subtext only because i haven't had the pleasure
2	ISFP Sister Strangely not Acting like an ISFP	My sister is an ISFP, but she strangely doesn't act like one. She's addicted to social media and seems to have other unhealthy behavior involving her image or self-image, she strangely conforms to things like trends, and she'll lie in bed all day and watch movies or get on social media.\n\nShe's grown up with an emotionally immature culturally out of touch ISFJ mom and emotionally immature ESTP dad who believes Fox News.\n\nShe has a college age emotionally unintelligent egotistical INTJ brother who has anger spells, throws tantrums, and who acts like an edge 10 year old (he'll  curse with him being angry being the excuse..even though the reaction is very disproportionate). He treats the people around them and talks to them like they're idiots but not in an "I scored a high IQ on an IQ test" way. He acts like Gen Z, Y, X, and the Baby Boomer generation are full of stupid people.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm perfect. I mean come on. Jokes aside, I don't really cause problems in this family. I just try to avoid it all as much as possible and manage my interactions with my parents.\n\nShe was on volleyball teams, and, based on what I've seen/heard, there was major psychological issues there.\n\nShe grew up most of her life in a really weird town in regards to how it operated socially. It's like it operated in a bubble with some outside influence, but when that influence came in, it behaved and aged very strangely.
4	I dont think being isfp would necessarily exclude behavior like how you describe her acting. She just sounds young to me. How do you think an isfp is supposed to act?
2	Any type, when faced with problematic situations, has the capacity to hide behind something like social media. It is used as a distraction from things that hurt. Not that that necessarily is whats going on. I dont know the situation. Her preferences may have changed, maybe she enjoys what she is doing. Idk, if you really think something is wrong, start doing something about it. Random fags on the internet (me) cant help you, i mean *really help*.
1	How old is she?
1	I actually feel bad for your sister.  It sucks to grow up in a dysfunctional family.  My mom is an isfj and my dad is an estp so definitely relatable.
1	Are you entp? Because you sound very entp and it would explain why you don't really understand her. It's true-- Fi dom and aux makes people self-absorbed especially when unhealthy. Fi dom will share something very personal and sensitive to entp and entp will feel uncomfortable about personal/ moralizing things and joke and Fi will feel like entp is making fun. Fi will rant and entp will joke again or say "then just do something about it" when Fi would just like to rant/ blow off steam. But, you seem to care and as her brother you should try to understand her and her Fi. Don't write it off over some stupid ideological system. You guys are family.
8	Jobs?	Any other ISFPs seem to have trouble finding jobs? It might just be my specific circumstances, but I'm curious.\n\nBeing a fairly quiet and introverted person, customer service type jobs don't generally suit me. (I can do them, but I'd prefer to be more behind the scenes)\nI'm also in college (full time), so that limits me to part time work.\n\nI've applied to at least a dozen places in the past month, only have managed to get an interview with one of them. Didn't get that job despite the interview going fairly well.
4	I always hate going through the job selection process.  On the other hand once I get a job I usually excel at it and enjoy it for the most part
2	Ive been struggling for a few months now but finally got hired as an animal care taker for a pet shop. Im excited because itll be in the back of the store and i wont have to do customer service which i hate and ill get to hang out with animals. I think itll be a good fit and i cant wait to start on tuesday. \n\nMaybe that job would be a good fit for you too? Either way hang in there, i hope you find something you like.
29	Anyone else really bad at small talk?	I feel weird when a conservation comes to a standstill but I have no idea how to fix it
16	I feel it physically..like my body gets more tense and stiff and I'm nodding my head agreeing with this person while in my head I'm hyper aware of how much I want to get out of there but on the other hand I also want to be social and have friends. 
10	I hate to bother people, so I'm always a little worried I might be boring someone when talking about myself or prying or intruding when asking the other person questions. Two fundamentals of a decent conversation.
4	I get really uncomfortable and just agree with what the other person is saying and I feel like it just makes me seem really fake. 
3	I suck at it too ... depending on which person I'm "small-talking" with. Some types are really good at keeping the discussion afloat, no matter how awkward one is at the beginning. I'm mostly referring to ESFP, and ESFJ. If you're not good at small-talk, I would recommend you to approach those types to watch and learn. They really know how to bring people out of their shell.  
2	Have to agree with you. Everytime i/someone starts small talk, i tend to just shutdown after a few minutes of i just start babbling about some useless/non-important crap.
2	When you get to know someone, let them know early that you aren't good with small talk. It's a good explanation of your quietness and it's completely normal to not be good at small talk, it isn't just us.
1	Small talk only sucks if the other person is boring.  Unfortunately most people are
11	Analysis Paralysis… How to Really Get Yourself Out of the Slump	
20	Reading Out Loud	Anyone else find that they digest the information from what they're reading easier when they read it out loud? When I'm reading I often have to go back and read the same sentence 2-3 times for it to fully sink in, but what I read it out loud I only have to read it once or twice. Still though, when I'm reading to someone else I tend to go in to a different mode where I power through getting the words out and not really get the meaning of what I'm speaking for myself.
4	Yup.
3	Definitely can’t follow along if reading outloud to others
3	Yes! I had to do this to memorize terms for my insurance exams. It was the only way for me to memorize stuff that were so booorring. Otherwise i would be reading the same paragraph for hours trying to grasp the subject.
2	I’m an infp and same!
2	> when I'm reading to someone else I tend to go in to a different mode where I power through getting the words out and not really get the meaning of what I'm speaking for myself.\n\n100% yup. When reading to others the focus for me tends to be on my voice, how suitable it sounds for the subject-matter, how engaging it is for the listeners. The content of the actual text goes over my head :)
1	Yes.
1	100% yes lol
1	I think I can read faster if I don’t read aloud.  I’m pretty good at remembering what I read if it’s interesting, literally impossible to focus tho if its boring
1	That's me.
1	This is me to a tee. :O
6	What MBTI type is the most romantically desirable to you? (Click the title to answer the short survey I made about it. The results are shown at the end :) )	
32	Is it common for us to have a strong desire to be social but can't?	I recently took the test the second time, with the same result, so I checked out this sub. I know it's slow, but I was wondering if a lot of you have this same feeling, where it feels like it would be most fulfilling to go out and meet all sorts of people but you can't because you're too introverted. Because I'm slowly coming to the realization that the emptiness of my life would be filled to some extent if I could muster up the bravery to be more social. I guess in a way this is in the definition of isfp but I'm not sure you feel that way haha. And if you have any advice on getting out of your social comfort zone I'd be glad to hear it.
14	Totally relatable. Best way to become more social (or so I'm told) is practice. Throw yourself into social situations and don't try too hard to talk all the time. It's natural for us to prefer listening, so just give your viewpoint when you're comfortable and don't be afraid of silence. It's underrated how comforting it is just to have someone present and willing to listen.\nAs you get to know people better, you'll find yourself more comfortable sharing your ideas with them over time.
4	Yes. All humans appear to need at least a little bit of positive social interaction in order to be happy and healthy.
4	I dont think i've ever seen a more relatable post on this sub. There are times when i cant talk, but really want to socialize with people, and when i try to talk to someone, i can't find anything to talk about. 
4	I'm late but if you're going to use a label use it to your benefit and not to your detriment. You sound shy and self doubting. Literally fake it til you make it. I know this kinda goes against our Fi and can come across as cringey if it's taken overboard, but start small like standing up straight, making eye contact with people and smiling. You'll notice people reciprocating these small gestures and it'll fuel actual confidence and good feelings. It's also helpful to actually take an interest in other people and learn about them. Everyone's a little narcissistic and if you demonstrate and interest in others it catalyzes some actual quality friendships. Lastly...you're right about mustering up the bravery to be more *vulnerable*. Let yourself open up, make mistakes, be disliked by some, and liked by others. Reddit is a good platform to do some preliminary tests. Have discussions with people, expose yourself to the full gamut of reactions and see how you yourself react. It's kinda like exposure therapy in a sense because that initial fear of the feeling of fear and sadness itself needs to be overcome :) \n\n
1	Yes. I felt the same way until I found my current gf. She definitely helps take the edge off things (she's a INFP). Also working retail opened me up a lot too. I'm still very reserved and positively sceptical towards people I don't know well and strangers. 
1	I believe that a lot of introverts can relate to that. 
1	I feel the same and its the reason that made chatting online so appealing. With voice chat so prominent I can easily talk to all kinds of people and if I dont like them I can just leave without having to feel guilty about ditching. Also gives you a lot of room to practice your social skill, the worse you can do is to say something dumb and since no one even know who you are anyways you can just pretend it never happened and do better next time. \n\nI was in a bit of a hole a few years back where for two years I would barely get out of my room and the only people I would talk to were cashiers. I began stuttering due to my lack of practice and finally realize I should probably find some people I can talk to from time to time.
1	I'd agree.
26	Do you also feel like a doormat for people?	For as long as I can remember, my role has been to please others without thinking of myself. It’s almost like I’m supposed to give but if I ask or stand up for myself I’m the selfish one. My family seems to be the root of this but just wondering how many other ISFPs experience this too? Is it part of our nature to be passive and let people walk over us? 
10	Yeah I feel so. I also have a fear that if I ever stood up for myself it would come off too harsh to people around me and would lead me to be even more misunderstood, even if I just wanted to express my wants and needs.
3	No I’m not like that. I’ve always been assertive, ever since I was a little kid my mom has told me. This sounds more like it’s related to Enneagram type than mbti type. I’m an enneagram 6. There’s a lot of good information at r/enneagram 
2	I often feel outspoken, if that counts? Like, one of the common reasons I won't put my opinion (a rare thing for me to have in the first place) forward is because I feel like people wouldn't listen to me anyway. Can't say I people-please without thinking of myself though. I usually do things for the sake of other people because it's what I feel is the right thing to do. ~~That, or I just want attention and compliments~~...
2	Yet an isfp may be especially gifted at asymmetrical influence, that is using the role of a doormat to actually get what they want. 
2	Kinda depends on who I'm with I think. With friends/acquaintances I'm more passive and I usually don't express my own wants (mainly because I don't really have them). With closer friends I've been trying to state my wants/needs since I've been told that it's okay to do so and they would prefer if I did. It's hard though because it makes me feel really selfish/needy when I do but I'm trying. \n\nI almost never really speak up to strangers about something unless it really goes against my values.
1	[deleted]
1	A lot of the things people concern themselves with don't bother me so in that sense I can come across as somewhat of a doormat because I am so easy going generally. However if it is something I care about I can be ridiculously stubborn.
5	a question to you isfps?	as an infp iv noticed the function that realy gives me intuitive insights into people is my tertery si(introverted sensing)i can quickly notice when something is off with someone,but the framework that my si has build from them,slight behavour changes and ill start getting impressions of an off feeling........my question is how does your tertery ni work?,and how does your ni work when reading people?
17	The way I observe people is mainly through their actions. Also I have hunches about people that mostly come from Ni. Don't exactly know how to explain it. My Ni gives me a rough-ish mental framework of how the person is like. For example if someone had said or done something that contradicts what they had earlier said or done I usually assume they are two faced. But I might still be curious why. My Ni mostly wants to gather as much information from the person as possible. I become a little obsessed with people I meet (not to the same extent as INxJs might, though), although I notice most people don't tend to be as ''obsessed'' or don't bother to dive deep. I am always open to new information. I usually pay attention to their interests, how they react to things, what their outlook on life is, etc. I try not to hold onto my ideas of people too much. I try not to make conclusions about people until I feel like I've gathered enough information. I try to remind myself of the possibility that they might secretly dislike me or they might betray me somewhere in the future (if I become friends with them), and just focus on how they are feeling in the moment. Therefore I tend to hold myself back a lot with new people. But when there's someone that I click with, or someone who just ''understands'' me, I tend to be a lot more open with them. \n\nWhen reading people, I focus a lot on their facial expressions and their mood. If they're in a bad mood, I usually tend to be more tentative and short with my speech to let them sort out their bad feelings. I might also link together ideas, or think about related things to what they are talking about in the background while I am talking with them. I don't let them see the process, as it's usually hard to define in the spot anyway. My answers might be short and not exactly descriptive of what's going on inside my mind as my communication style tends to be very in the moment. \n\nHope this helped \n\nedit: Dunno about other ISFPs, but this is how I notice myself working most of the time.
22	When an ISFP makes it	
11	[points to the biggest section of the house] and this is for, like, sleeping
3	Really? Idk if ISFP would be this excessive. I don't care how much money I have I'd never need 4 ovens.\n\nThat pot filler though..
3	This was orgasmic to watch hahaha
2	ISFP or not, I just appreciate the house and wow, why am I not filthy rich again? :(  \n\n(Completely OT, I just wonder why I couldn’t just be born into a wealthy family, like, sure, the world would hate me for doing absolutely nothing to earn my wealth, but I mean, who cares? I got money!)
1	Is he confirmed ISFP?
1	Honestly I just really want the Skittles machine and music studio, maybe the weight room... lol.
4	Any ISFPs that have found a career they love?	
9	I was with you until “Love”
6	No. I don't know if I'll ever find a career I love 
6	I am still studying but for me it feels like that I could have fun at everything I will do. Just my positive life attitude :)
6	I'm a physical therapist assistant, and I can't imagine myself doing something outside of this field. 
4	I really enjoyed woodworking, however it doesn't pay very well unless you get to management, which then it is completely different. Dabbled in many careers - mostly feeler type like teaching and previously worked in customer service. I'm moving into coding which feels like a lot of fun. At first thought I wouldn't like "tech" because it doesn't seem creative or "warm", but actually found it really creative and inspirational. You can create a large impact on people without needing to be in the public spotlight and you can creatively solve problems.
3	Hey there! I LOVE being a musician 😊 It fulfils my Introverted Feeling and Extraverted Sensing (Writing music, designing logos and posters, performing), and it satisfies my Extraverted Thinking (Managing bookings and social media, creating marketing plans, and budgeting). \n\nThe money isn’t great, but it’s an amazing outlet and it ultimately makes me happy.
2	still in school, but I really like dentistry...so far. you get to use your hands, provide a really important service and the avg dentist works less 40 hrs a week if hobbies/home life are super important to you.
2	Teaching a martial art, and managing a martial arts school, is amazingly well-suited for me.\n\nIt's part desk job (which is supposed to be bad for ISFPs) but only a few hours a day, and the rest of the time I am helping people learn an art which I love, and which has helped me tremendously.  I get to be active, do good, spread good vibes.\n\nThe "I" part of me was afraid to stand in front of a group and teach, but I got over that in instructor training.
1	Writing is ok. Do I 'love' it? No. But it's probably the best job I could have.
1	I'm still in school right now. I'm probably going to sound like a super typical ISFP but I'm currently getting my graphic design degree at the moment and then I will go get my fine arts degree and teaching certification possibly. I love being in a creative program at school it can be stressful at times but I'm always very motivated and excited about what I get to learn. I think I'd like to be a high school art teacher eventually. The only thing I'm worried about is public speaking but I feel like if I'm teaching something that I love it will be easier. Before getting into this program I majored in music which I loved but it was too competitive and I couldn't see myself doing it professionally for the rest of my life. Then I switched to psychology which was interesting at first but I never really felt like I "fit in" with the other people in the program and then I switched to political science very briefly. I feel like it can be really difficult to find the right path for ISFP's bc most of the things we love to do don't usually pay the bills 
4	Can someone explain to me what the Ti/Fe/Fi/Ti/other types are?	I recognize the 16 types, but whenever I’m on this sub, people mention things like a “Fi loop” and i’m completely confused on what this is. Can someone explain what these are?\n\nEdit: Ti/Fe/Fi/Te/other\n\nEdit 2: thank you u/emptystage I understand they are cognitive functions now. \n\n

6	Adhd isfp's	Hi new here\n\nDo any of you have adhd pi\nand if so, do meds have an effect on you?\nI was wondering because isfp traits and struggles\nresembles that of adhd.\n\nI started medication 3 months ago, but don't feel much different, so maybe it just could be my personality. \n\nThanks for reading and hope you respond :)
3	i have ADHD and am an isfp. i started meds at 13. they did help but they didn't fix everything. i was still a bit forgetful on them and (like anyone) struggled to pay attention to things i wasn't interested in, but my executive function hugely improved and i had a stronger desire to stay on task and get things done, and see the larger picture of situations and tasks rather than hyperfocusing on the details.\n\nif your meds aren't working for you, read more about how they should be taken for maximum effect. for example, my meds right now must be taken on an empty stomach and i have found they do not work at all if i take them after a meal. you can also ask your psychiatrist to try a different brand or a higher dose.
2	I was just recently thinking about how ISFP is the quintessential ADHD type. It just feels like im reading a description of the daily impulsiveness and creativity minus the struggles LMAO. I honestly don't know if meds have an effect on my personality type because I had fixed alot of self-problems that allowed me to actually be myself while on meds and I haven't taken a solid break ever so I'm not sure but I feel like things would be the same.
1	I have ADHD and for me it feels like I do nothing on or off em. Weed helps but I've been having heart issues
1	Interesting that I've come across this! I was just having this conversation with my ISFP husband, maybe a little over three weeks ago? \n\nHe was diagnosed with ADD in his teens and I brought up to him that the more I study the cognitive functions, the more I think that this is just the way he is, no ADD diagnosis necessary. \n\nSo funny that I was thinking this thing and here it is. 
1	yep, adhd. vyvanse changed my life for the good. 
6	Are you a dog or cat person and why?	
12	While I like cats, I much prefer dogs. I find that I understand them better. When cats come up to me I don't know what they want and the process of figuring out how they like to be pet is sometimes hard for me (I don't like the rejection). Dogs are always happy to see you, love a good pet and rub and you feel like they're immediately your friend. 
7	I think I like cats. But then they are stubborn, independent and don’t listen so they frustrate me. And then they get mad at me and act snooty so I’m just done. Then I’m like “dogs aren’t that bad!” But then I realize dogs are annoying.. but I do prefer them over cats. They are always willing to give you a million chances. My mood is always up and down and dogs are ALWAYS there no matter what. They just want to make you happy and they may be annoying but they are such loving creatures. \n
4	Personally I like both, but cats are much more my kind of animals. I like their independence compared to dogs. Cats will do what they want, when they want. I might also like them more since I can kind of relate to this behavior. 
3	I love cats but I'm allergic to them :'(
2	I likes cats, they need less attention.(as an introvert, high maintenance stuff are incredibly draining)  Quieter, and smaller too.\n\nIt's fun to mess with them too lol. 
2	i'm definitely a dog person. i love cats for sure but i feel like i can bond with dogs on a much deeper level than i have with cats. i think it's because i have an easier time feeling the love dogs give because of their smiles and body language whereas with cats it's more difficult for me to understand their moods since their behavior isn't as obvious most of the time. 
1	Im a rhodent and birds type of person. Can't pick between those two
1	I'm in the middle, there are good cats, bad cats, good dogs, bad dogs, pretty cats, ugly cats, pretty dogs and ugly dogs. However, I'm rather lazy and don't really go outside much so as a pet dogs aren't really that practical for me. I prefer a calm, independent cat.
1	Cats aren't as needy. Dogs are fun to hike with and play with and stuff but generally I prefer the low maintenance aspect of a cat. If I need to be gone all day or for a couple days its not an issue for them as they're so solitary anyways. I appreciate the independence. Ive had quite a few cats over the years and I think people underestimate their intelligence. Emotional and otherwise. For example I have an 8 year old tabby cat female who has learned to come to me when I'm sad or crying. She comforts me and is very gentle in contrast to when she just wants attention from me on a normal occasion and can be brash and demanding. Before I had cats I had no idea they could be loving in this way similar to a dog. This same cat also plays fetch and is very vocal and communicative. I really just find cats fascinating. The wild and the domestic ones. 
1	I like dogs because they are cute. But I wouldn't own one because I would go insane worrying about it all the time. I prefer cats because their personalities are similar to my own. Cats are chill, loving, and smarter than most dogs. My father's dog goes outside and eats the dirt that smells the strongest. Plus cats are very easy to care for. 
1	I do like dogs, my friend’s sister brought her puppy over yesterday and I fell in love (little lab puppy, I want).\n\nBut I REALLY love cats. Maybe it’s because I never really had dogs, but I’ve had cats almost my whole life so I understand their behavior etc.\nThat and cats are just “cuter”, imo. \nSmall fuzzy things are life.\n\nShit, my friend’s cat is evil and always attacks me and I have to carry a water sprayer around whenever I’m over, yet I still love the little pos. 
1	So funny I was thinking about making this post earlier today.  Dog guy btw
1	I love both but I would definitely consider myself a cat person. I currently have three. They're sweet, loving and more low maintenance. I also grew up with cats so I thinks that's probably a big reason I prefer them. I love other people's dogs but I don't think I'm capable of having my own ATM. Personally I don't have the energy or focus to train a dog properly and I feel like I would be doing it a disservice if I got one. I would like to get one eventually though. 
1	cats because they are independent and less needy 
5	Your experience with INTJs?	For me, I can’t help but feel friction with this type. I’m drawn to them and feel repelled by the, A’s well, as though I can’t completely be myself around them. I’m more subdued and there are way more awkward  moments with them. As though I feel judged by them, maybe because they exacerbate our weakness (extroverted thinking). Any thoughts?
7	(I'm an ISFP) I Dated one (INTJ) for around 8 months, absolutely loved being with them.\n\nA couple things that stuck out to me about them were...\n- Very academically focused, to the point where that's why the relationship ended as they just didn't have the time to worry about me and academics.\n- Emotions were a bit tricky. When the situation was one where people would be sad/upset, they seemed to remain neutral. Generally was very kind, happy, and loving.\n- Their mind, holy shit, I've never met anyone with as interesting of a mind as them, and doubt I ever will. They had millions of complex things buzzing through their head constantly. It just blows me away, especially compared to my mind where it seems rather blank most of the time. (Random thoughts appear every now and then, but it's generally pretty quiet up there. I do know there's a lot going on behind closed doors though.)\n\nI can say I definitely felt inferior to them at times, but that also pushed me to improve myself more (since I'm fairly competitive).
3	I’ve had mostly positive experiences with INTJs tbh. They can be a little intimidating, but overall I can appreciate their thinking style even though it’s very different from my own. It probably helps that I have multiple friends/family members that are INTJs so I’ve spent quite a bit of time around that type. I’ve had the most awkward encounters with INTPs
3	I'm dating one. In general I appreciate the dry humor and hard logic Intjs exhibit. I've always been drawn to this type of person. I appreciate the structure and stability. Something that I struggle with and have not had great examples of growing up. 
3	I’m a bit late to this thread, but oh well!\n\nI’m an ISFP and I’ve dated an INTJ, he was my first boyfriend. He was great at the beginning, very witty, funny and confident. But I realised after a few months that he didn’t really think about my feelings. \n\nBecause I was scared of conflict, and I didn’t know any better, I would pretty much do anything he asked. He would take advantage of that by making me do things I clearly didn’t feel comfortable with. \n\nI think the problem with ISFPs dating INTJs is that they won’t be able to provide the emotional support that the ISFP needs. My ex found it hard to tell when I was in a bad mood, and would often just ignore it unless I said something. Two introverted feelers in a relationship is hard! \n\nPeace ✌️
2	My dad's an INTJ. If we ever have a conversation, it always seems like we're having two completely different conversations about the same thing. I guess that's what happens when you're almost the polar opposite of each other.\n\nHe often likes to give me incredibly detailed travel advice that I cannot possibly parse. I can feel his exasperation in my soul when I say, 'I'll just wing it lOL.'\n\nNowadays we get along okay I suppose, but we didn't much when I was a teenager.
1	The INTJ I know is really sweet and cares for her friends a lot. She is most definitely not mistyped, but she Fi loops a lot. Sometimes she can be too critical of people and I just listen to her bitch about them. Can't do anything about it because that's her, but I really like that when I tell her something about herself that she needs to work on she really listens and is not stuck up about it.
5	Do you guys believe in astrology more than mbti?	
12	No

2	lol wut
2	Which types do u get along with and which types make best friends to u?	
9	I tend to get along great with ISTPs, INFPs and INTJs.
5	Best friends are ISTP and INFP. One for doing activities with minimal talking and the other for the greatest non-judgy deep talks.
5	Infps <3 but not the type that sees itself as a victim all the time. And not the type that blames sensors for all of life’s problems. I love my Infps :) so understanding, forgiving, and knowledgeable. Love their Ne and ability to see good in everyone and everything. 
3	In general, I mainly get along with xnfps, xntps, and other isfps. My best friends are all infps. Infps (and intps) are hella funny and their humor is typically very witty which I like. They think about literally everything at some point, and it is always interesting to hear the crazy shit that comes out of their mouths. I get along with enfps and entps great too, but my friendships with them aren't as close. 
3	ESFP, XNFP, INTPs, ISTPs... in theory ESFJs but I've never met one.\n\nISTPs - their bluntness can be endearing and it's sometimes just nice to hang out with somebody who's completely straight with you, and who doesn't spend all day talking/feeling themselves into circles\n\nESFP - so much fun, another type I like because they let me let go of some of my own ever-present worries and just focus on the 'now'\n\nINFP - talking about emotions with another Fi dom is A++, I feel like INFPs 'get' me\n\nENFP - also tend to 'get' me, but more outgoing, which is nice when I don't feel like making all the decisions and being in charge... can be overwhelming though, as can INFPs, but less so.\n\nINTP - generally about as spontaneous as I am (or at least able to go with the flow of my own spontaneity), inferior Fe pairs well with my Fi dom IMHO, goofy, relaxed people it's fun to hang out with who don't tend to get bogged down in emotions, tend to ramble, which can be nice if they don't expect you to be 100% focused on them\n\nI'm least likely to get along with INTJs and ISFJ, for opposing reasons. ISFJs are too timid and people-pleasing, INTJs are too arrogant and self-centred.\n\nOf course I'm speaking in generalities haha. One of my closest/long term friends is an INTJ, and we clash sometimes but she's genuinely a lovely human being. I think I could probably get along with somebody of any type, depending on how their MBTI type expresses itself.
2	i get along with lots of esfjs and infps! most of the people in my life just seem to be these two types i guess
2	I'm pretty sure my best friend is INTJ but I'm not the best at typing other people. I also get along quite well with his girlfriend, who I think is either ESFP or ENFP. Oh yeah I'm also very close with an INFJ. Also my (slightly) younger sister is an ISTJ and we get along whenever I'm not annoying the heck out of her with my fidgety quirks and inability to sit still and be quiet for more than 10 seconds. She's the person I tend to vent to about life problems because she has a better grip on how to break things down into step-by-step solutions, as well as because we're family and she knows pretty much everything about me.\n\nI connect with the INTJ mostly through common interests and similar sense of humour. His gf because she asks deep questions straight off the bat and we have good meaningful discussions. And I get along with the INFJ for a combination of similar interests, meaningful conversations, and because we complement each other in that she can talk on and on about something whilst I prefer listening to contributing.
3	ESFP’s and ESFJ’s \n\n(they’re the type of people that I usually 99% of the time get along with, the other 1% where don’t get along with them is rare.)\n\nOther ISFP’s will be a hit or miss (depending on values/beliefs) 
6	What animal would perfectly describe isfps in your opinion?	
13	Bears. Chilling in the woods, eating berries. 
13	Cats
11	I'd say a bunny. They're rubbish at conflict too!
6	Sloth
5	Nothing more ISFP than a chill penguin
7	A non-social butterfly. They fly around all chill, fly away from danger, add beauty and calmness to the world.
4	Chameleons. \n-Adapt to their surroundings, but still do their own thing.\n-Always looking around and getting a feel for things\n-When they lock onto something, they get straight to the point\n-Just chillin' most of the time\n-Doesn't verbalise without good reason\n-Colourful and has strong aesthetic preferences\n-Takes a special kind of person to know what they're really thinking
2	well i relate to sloths
2	horse
5	Big 5 Correlations (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ISFPs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ISFP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance!\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

3	What are your preferences in games/anime/movies/etc?	For me:\n\nGames:\n\nAction-Adventure/Hack & Slash (think God of War, Metal Gear Rising type games), RPG (mainly oldschool sprite-based ones, but also more action-oriented ones like Skyrim and Fallout), Survival Horror (Silent Hill, Dino Crisis) and platformers (Mega Man, mainly) are my favorites. I'm not really into puzzle games or FPS games.\n\nAnime:\n\nAction, drama, thriller, horror and sci-fi are neat. I generally don't really like slice of life and romance, but there are some exceptions.\n\nMovies:\n\nI only really watch movies for horror and thriller, since they are scarce in anime. Outside of that, a good drama or comedy movie can be nice.
2	for games i like moba or strategy/logic.\nwhen i watch anime is when i'm really bored and have the need to feel something so i like romantic/school life but also like more dark stuff \nand finally movies, i like 90 drama/crime, something along the lines of pulp fiction, the godfather (etc) but i also enjoy terror and animated movies! 
2	I always have a hard time picking favourites when it comes to genres. Style/story/character aren't super important to me, but I can enjoy them. What sticks with me the most though, is the mood something creates.
2	games: i enjoy casual ones (usually with cool art styles), mmorpgs, open ended games, or puzzle games\n\nanime: i like casual slice of life animes, maybe a few action adventure ones!\n\nmovies: definitely animated movies, or adventure
1	Games: Action/adventure, platformers, and JRPG have been lifetime favorites of mine. I'm trying to get into more strategy-based and simulation-based games lately. \n\nAnime: Shows that have drama, social commentary, or pseudo-philosophical ideas, maybe with some action thrown in for good measure. I also have a soft spot for slice of life. \n\nMovies: Same as anime.
12	How do you feel about our ISTP cousins?	I've been spending a lot of time on the istp sub and I've been really enjoying myself. I love their similar sense of humor and they have really interesting and relatable ways of thinking. While they can seem hostile or inconsiderate, they're a okay I'm my book.\n\nHow do you feel about them? Are they too harsh for you or can you overlook their Ti dom and let them get a laugh out of you?
11	I truly feel like they’re the only ones of any other type who “get” me, even though it seems like we are on completely different wavelengths most (if not all) of the time. Ah, that Fi Ti clash.\n\nThey are near impossible to read. In the case of my ISTP bf, when we were first getting to know each other, I had no idea he was remotely interested in me. Couldn’t tell if he wanted to kiss me or kill me. Eventually I got the message ;p \n\nA concern that popped up later was that I didn’t feel like he understood me when I came to him with certain problems... like he couldn’t empathize “properly”. So frustrating. But I learned he empathizes very much indeed, just in his own practical way.  \n\nOne of my favorite places to hang out is in my ISTP cousin’s auto shop. Sometimes we don’t even talk to each other, just hang out in a comfortable silence lol.\n\nThey are so inherently helpful.\n\nThey can certainly come off as harsh and rude to some, but I respect their honesty, even though our views don’t always jive. We usually come to an amicable disagreement.\n\nSometimes they are so deadpan and straightforward with their thoughts/opinions it comes off as unintentionally funny and I start laughing. I only laugh harder at their puzzled expressions.\n\nI read somewhere that they are very “catlike” people - an apt description.\n\nAnyway, those are my scattered thoughts. As for the ISTPs I personally know, I cherish them all :)
5	that sub has some toxic users. But the rest are great. -ISTP 
2	My younger brother and one of my friends are both ISTPs. My little brother is one of my best friends, he gets my jokes and odd humor. The other ISTP I know is almost a decade older than my brother and it's really interesting to talk to her. There will be times where we're talking about whatever topic and the stuff she says sounds like it would come from my brother.  Anyways, my opinion on ISTPs is that they're cool people. Definitely can be prickly and rough around the edges, but in a way that's kind of they're allure to me.
2	I've known some pretty cool ISTP's before. During one of my first part time jobs. (when i was like 19)\n\nThere was this male ISTP who was a few years older than me, we had jobs where we had to work together. He would lecture me on how to do the job ( in a very freindly manner), and then then we'd have conversations about what i was studying for college and then i'd ask him about what he did and etc..........\n\nLike he'd act genuinely concerned about me and it felt real lol. He kind of seemed like an older brother ( not really, but i had the vibe)\n\nThe thing i like about freindships with SP's is that it's a lot more thrilling, *like, we don't just talk*, we exchange banter and sometimes it can even get a bit aggressive. ( like jokingly aggressive) ( but i like that)\n\nCompared to relationships with XSFJ's, those are more of just completely an passive exchange of deep/superficial words and feelings.\n\nBoth can be fun though.( it depends on my mood of course)
2	With my ISTP friend-\nWe get each other's humor and enjoy hanging out in a group, but we're both too quiet and chill to keep a conversation going with just us (even though we'd like to). We're both kind of the observers in the group. It's unfortunate, I feel like I'm missing out.
1	I'm generally really attracted to istps. They are really laidback, and it is real easy to just chill out with them. I always try to get any reaction out of them because most of the ones I know try to hide how they are feeling. I really like trying to get them to laugh haha. However, something I don't like is when they are angry. The istps in my life get suuuper passive and turn into "brats" when they are mad. It is like they really want you to see how mad they are without having to verbally tell you. I also see them as the type of people who need to be around people and craves being with friends, but also needs to have space and be alone. I think they are very relatable
13	Anyone else not very "artistically inclined?"	I appreciate art and music, but haven't put any time into doing it myself. I would like to pick up a guitar over the summer. I used to be into fashion but I've found myself wearing just t shirts recently. I just find a lot of summaries of our personality trait as "the artist." 
8	Even as an isfp, you still would have to put in just as much time and effort into the arts as any other type to "get good." Guitar can be really fun but it takes time to learn the chords and rhythms to get to a point where you don't have to think to play. It can be discouraging to some that it takes a lot of time but if your heart is in it, anyone can play guitar. Also, your fingers hurt like hell when u first start. That why I chose piano. Just as difficult, but less pain.\n\nAlso this is not to discourage you from picking it up. Playing music is such a rewarding experience and I get this feeling like nothing else when I play, especially when I perform so the pain and hard work and time are definitely worth it if your heart is in it
5	Just as not all INTPs are scientists or programmers (some are musicians, writers, actors, etc.), not all ISFPs will fit the artistic stereotype. Typology does not explain 100% of your personality.\n\nISFPs' values can manifest as activism, care for others, etc. ISFPs make extremely good paramedics and trauma surgeons.
4	I consider myself not very artistic at all. I play the saxophone and have a deep appreciation for music, but actually creating Something? I just can’t do that. I tend to have a lot of creator’s block. 
2	I'm somewhere in the middle. Some art forms I can really get behind, but others it's just kinda ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.\n\nPhotography and Theatre are two big ones for me, but I wouldn't touch stuff like painting/drawing with a 10-foot pole.
6	Non-artistic hobbies?	When I'm not practicing/listening to music, I tend to watch YouTube, play video games and watch a little anime here and there. Pretty standard imo. What kind of hobbies do you have that don't cater to your creative side? 
6	[I mean...](http://www.ebbits.net/static/comics/forsakenartforms.png)\n\nIn seriousness, I play video games (I'm playing Life is Strange: before the storm right now and I'm sorry but Chloe is definitely an ISFP in my humble opinion), I watch LPs on youtube, and I train our dogs. \n\nSaying I 'play video games' seems really minimizing seeing as there are so many kinds out there. I don't tend to play a lot of FPS or 'building' games, and I stay away from any kind of games you play over the internet with other people. I enjoy games where the focus is on the story, not 'skill' (telltale games, LiS, etc.), RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout (which are kinda like telling your *own* story), open-ended games like The Sims (but not as often)... But honestly the games I play most often are probably roguelikes because they're easy to pick up and put down. I play a floor of binding of isaac, go back to writing... Play floor... more writing, haha.\n\n\n...Most of my other hobbies are 'artistic' in some way, though. I write, I cook, I draw. I seek out the artistic creations of others (whether original fiction and art or fan-stuff).
5	Add a little more anime to the mix and you get me, haha.
2	Working out, video games and sports.  Never actually was particularly gifted with making music or art, although I tried both
2	eating\n\nbiking\n\ngaming\n\nreading something almost constantly\n\nsmoking pot\n\nworking with energy healing lmao
2	Working out\nGardening\nCleaning
2	Extreme downhill skiing, wandering alone around my college campus/college town, drinking coffee
2	I used to take photos to scratch that creative “itch.” Now I play the ukulele. It’s pretty easy and fun. 
1	Video games, watching cartoons, watching/listening to ASMR, chatting/lurking on Discord and social media, doing extensive research in bursts on obscure topics (like MBTI haha), reblogging things on tumblr, obsessing over people... wow it's harder to thing of non-artistic things than I thought. Umm, basically anything but sport. I find most sports boring to watch and stressful to play.
1	(regularly) procrastinating (mainly watching random, interesting, or educational YouTube videos), (occasionally) programming, and (rarely) video games.
1	Fantastic question!\n\nLast summer I \(an ISFP\) got into RC planes. Its been an amazing hobby to get into, I think mostly because it appeals to the need for freedom and fun that us ISFP's need! Additionally you can fly planes by your self, there is no need to have other people around. There is something amazing about heading out in the early morning \(less wind\) or late evening \(less wind\) to a wide open field by your self and just taking full control over a small RC plane, for what feels like forever, but in actuality just several minutes. It's a very tranquil experience and presents a really different hand\-eye coordination experience than video games can provide.\n\nI've also been doing long distance target shooting on my grandfathers farm. If you'r not opposed to fire arms and have access to a range, .22LR's or .223 rifles are quite inexpensive. It can be a rewarding experience to hit targets from \>100 yards away, it really test your ability to be still and concentrate. Like my RC plane example you don't need to have other people near by, just you, your rifle, and an "unlucky" clay bird down range.
9	ISFPs, what kind of social life did you maintain in high school?	Like, how many friends you had, any intimate relationships, and how you felt you fit in the system or not.
9	Never bothered to classify a peer as a "friend" so i had really, 1 best friend and most of the people in my classes were "welcome acquaintances." Had one relationship in the first year that I ended because I wanted to focus on school and myself (pretty selfish I know, I'm better now). \n\nAnd I never felt the need to "fit in" to the system. I wanted to be me because for some reason I liked myself at 14 years old. Peers chose to like me or dislike me because of it. By the time I graduated most of my school knew who I was and I knew most of them. In the end, I had a pretty good experience in high school, even if I'm in the minority because of it.
5	Personally for me, I only keep tight friend circles, good relationships with my teachers and classmates mostly, and I've attempted to start an intimate relationship with someone who didn't feel the same. A lot of the time I also feel like an outcast since I socialize a lot less than most of the other people do. 
6	I carved out my own little social niche - a group of 6-8 friends or so, and more than a handful of amicable acquaintances. \n\nI came close to intimate/romantic relationships a few times from junior to senior years, but I was just too shy to take it any further. I wasn’t emotionally ready, and it didn’t help that the guys I knew had pretty overbearing personalities.\n\nI felt different, like I didn’t fit in with any particular group. In contrast, I presented and conducted myself in a chameleon-like way. I kept up with the latest trends, said things I thought would be acceptable to everyone else, was careful not to offend anyone. Tried to remain on good terms with everyone. My personality sort of lived through other people, and I frequently got lost in the mix.\n
3	I was one the football team and the Golf Team and both teams won states while I was on it, so no one hated me but no one really loved me either. \nIt was one of those things where they try to talk to me and I talk back but not interesting enough for people to care nor be offended so people liked me and all the "cool kids" knew me but I wasn't exactly popular as I didn't hangout with them. \nI tended to hangout with the lower tier cool kids that were super smart and social and a year ahead of me. I didn't realize all my friends were older than me until I was a senior and had no good friends in school. \nIts actually interesting to look back at my high school life being 8 years out. If you ask my brother and sister in law they would say I was popular though. 
3	It would take a lot for me to comfortably say someone was a friend. At the end of it all I only had three true and strong friends that stayed together and to me the rest of my group were in varying levels of the periphery. I am definitely a quality over quantity person. I tried the other way around and it was no where near fullfilling enough for me. I was pretty much what you would describe as blending into the lockers. I didn't mind though I was living in my happy life and that was that 
2	I had (still have) quite a lot of friends (around 6). Didn't (and still don't) really see them much outside of school, though. We still keep contact through WhatsApp and see each other every now and then, but overall it's fine I guess.
2	What are friends? (somewhat sarcastic)\n\nI had a handful of friends, none of which I was really close with, except for one of them, whom I ended up dating for just over half a year. Since high school my social life has done all but improve. I've met maybe 2 people in college, neither of which I talk to outside of class.
2	I was lucky enough to go to a school system where marching band was a cool thing to be in. So I had a family of 140 people through high school, and as with family, you don't always like them, but you can trust them to be there for you. I had lots of close acquaintances, and several really good friendships that have continued after graduation. (Mellophone FTW)
2	I'm in high school currently (freshman so kinda young) and I have a smallish- medium circle of friends, ALOT of acquaintances which with a decent amount I will have a small conversation with every single once in a while, I haven't been in a relationship for awhile, though I do has a girl that likes be cuz I use to talk to her back n 6th grade and she left for a couple years and now shes back and recognizes me, and I like her back to cuz she's pretty, but in really shitty at showing it since I don't talk to her currently and she eyes me n the hall every day but I act like she doesn't exist, so if she stops liking me, I don't blame her. Overall, I REALLY enjoy the freedom I have in high school, I've noticed it alot in my work, but I really just prefer to have a teacher tell me exactly what to do. So if that answers your question, then COOL.
2	I had formed a pretty solid group of friends in middle school(about 10 or so people) with pretty diverse personality types, which actually worked out really well. Most of us stayed friends through high school with some people entering or leaving the group, but there was a good handful of us that stayed together through high school. I graduated 2 years ago and since then we've all had our own separate lives with work/college and whatnot, and there's only 4-5 of them that I still consider close friends. The kind of friends that you can go a while without talking but can seamlessly catch back up once you talk again. \n\nOutside of that, I really didn't make any new friends past sophomore year. I was too shy to talk to people in my classes. I kept my head down while walking in the halls and overall felt pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people. My senior year was especially rough because I didn't have a single class or the same lunch period with any of my friends. I would often just go and sit in my car or outside somewhere during lunch. I did end up becoming casual friends with one girl who shared the same lunch period with me, but even then I would sometimes avoid meeting her at lunch to spare myself forced small talk. My social anxiety made me feel that she would sit with me only because she felt bad that I would otherwise be alone, and I preferred spending lunch alone to feeling like that. In hindsight I do think she genuinely enjoyed my company, but I digress. \n\nThe final factor that affected my social life was the guy(INTJ) I was dating through my junior and senior years. He was in college and quite a few years older than me. The gist of that situation being that he vied for my full attention and caused me to drift away from my close circle of friends. I deeply regret that whole relationship for a number of reasons, but relevant to this post, he absolutely stunted my social life in high school. \n\nOverall 0/10 would not relive high school. \n
1	I'm a much different person now but in high school, I had a small group of 6-7 friends. I didn't see them much other than outside of school or after school Fridays. The odd Saturday if they wanted to see a movie, or something. Tried pursuing 2 different girls but no luck. \n\n>fit in the system\n\nAssuming you mean popularity wise, I wasn't an outcast but I wasn't the cool kid either. Got invited out to events; was friends with 2 of the "it" girls. I was pretty quiet, and reserved unless I was with those closer friends though. Was somewhat friends with the cool kids, where I got invited to their parties but never went because they weren't my close friends.
17	Anyone else fall in love too easily?	Every time i start to talk to someone im romantically interested in, i become completely obsessed with them. Im not talking stalker level obsession, just as soon as i know i want to develop a relationship i just can't. stop. thinking. about. that. person. This is actually my biggest problem that interferes with my mental health since i become sooo infatuated with that person i get depressed whenever things don't work and it takes me forever to get over it bc of how much i liked them. I always see posts of ISFPs having trouble with long term relationships but i feel like i have the opposite problem. Do any other ISFPs develop crushes really easily? or often become obsessed with liking their crush? 
6	hey :) ISFP girl here !\nI'm always getting infatuated by someone I'm starting to get to know, and sometimes it's so frustrating because you know what's coming but you can't stop your heart from feeling sh*t. ahah\nI wouldn't say I get depressed but I do get really sad, but that is only natural and it will eventually fade because it was never true love in the first place, it was just infatuation which is: attraction to somebody you don't really know, however what you do know is the idea you created about that person and that's what you "love", so it's not love *hope it makes sense*. When I accept that it becomes easier to cope with my feelings, but there's nothing you can do to stop feeling stuff for other people because honestly that's beautiful so feel it all and go with the flow !!
5	Holy yes, not falling in love, but obsessing in a romantic way, as you said .
4	Wow. My now husband. It freaked me out when we started dating. ALL in early on. But in the other hand it took forever for him to open up about him. It was hard great me to adjust after awhile because, as I discovered later with most ISFPs his love was true and intense but the intensity is short lived. 
3	Not. At. All.
3	If im falling in love with someone, I've taken the time to actually get to know you and what you like, and I don't just care about your looks, I have to see an interesting personality that drives me to know more about the person. The most important part in relationships for me is personality. I fell hard for this one girl and I always thought everything she did was interesting. I romanticized everything about her, yet I still really find her interesting to this day which even though she's said she only wants to be friends with me. So I don't get crushes at all easily, but if I have a crush on someone, it's based on their personality, not looks. 
3	Not love, love, but the idea of love, and yes romanticising a person. I find as I've gotten older than happens less. Not fun to get your feelings hurt or your heart battered often. I'm quicker to recognize what is what and either shut it down, or just avoid romantic situations in general and focus on something else. IIWII.
2	I have kind of the opposite problem, actually. I rarely come across men who are even mildly attractive to me physically, and when I do, their personhood isn't usually attractive enough to keep me interested, even though I might continue indulging in the crush. I'd love to meet someone who creates the kind of romantic excitement you're describing, but I've yet to find a man who makes me feel that way on this level. 
2	Heck yes... and it's rough, especially if the person doesn't end up liking you back. But on the flip side of that, I can also fall out of love too easily too if I don't see it working out (although the initial pain of not having them there as a support system 24/7 can be rough). \n\nISFPs seem to be the type to love most intensely, which makes sense, since I know a few ENTJs and they basically view relationships as a contractual obligation. Yeah, when you think about ISFP celebrities like Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, etc. you can see that their dating habits were heavily based on that strong initial feeling of love, which unfortunately doesn't always work out if the logistical compatibility isn't there.
1	MY BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH HIGJ SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND ITS DRIVING ME INSANE 
3	How to get out of fi/ni loop?	How do you guys pull yourselves out of fi/ni loops?  I workout, watch movies, play video games and listen to music, but whenever there’s any downtime I can feel my mind starting to drift into fi/ni mode.
3	hey ! I think it's okay to have your introvert time along with your introverted functions, because it's your mind coping with whatever you are going through. In my opinion if you only get yourself in a loop when you're not okay, just accept the loop ahah \nafter you're done processing and understanding your own feelings, you can go to your extroverted funtions again because that's when your "healthy"/balanced. \nhope it helped !!
7	How to get to know a ISFP and get them out of their shell?	Hi all\n\nSo I have an ISFP friend and I am wanting to get to know them better. Also wanting them to open up more I feel I am often sharing more stuff with them than they are with me. Any advice would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks 
7	My husband is an ISFP.  I will say bombarding them or overstimulation throws hum way off and he retreats. When we were dating..I found quiet places, familiar environments, and genuine interest without being pushy and a lot of time allowed him to feel safe to open up. 
6	You don’t 
7	1. Encourage their quirky/awkwardness\n\n2. Talk about art! (Film, music, photograpy included. Isfp's have many creative outlets other than painting and such)\n\n3. TIME! It takes time to get to know us so dont give up too quickly!\n\nP.s. the last one is the most important
5	Best way to get anyone out of their shell is to joke, to ask questions about their lives and be curious about them. 
2	Ask them to do something fun one on one
9	How do you learn best?	I find that I learn quickest through visual learning. I like graphs and charts and if I can see it, I can probably learn it. But I find that if I learn by doing, it takes me a while but I get an overall better understanding of whatever it is.\n\nHow do the rest of you isfp's like to learn? The three main ones are visual (seeing), auditory (hearing), and kinesthetic (doing), but you may have a specific way that is unique and works best for you.
18	I'm not entirely sure how I learn best, but I know that auditory learning is my worst. It just goes in one ear and out the other. 
9	visual definitely helps me out the best 
8	If there isn’t something in front of me teaching me how to do it, i have a very small chance of learning anything. I’m such a visual learner. 
3	Visual learning, probably. But also trying to teach someone else what you’ve just learnt is very effective. 
2	Flash cards! I'm a flash card queen. Maybe it's because I'm in school for nursing and it's mostly memorization. When I'm trying to understand a concept though, I'll draw a picture with blanks missing so I can fill them in. It definitely takes me more than just "skimming" information. 
2	Visual and kinesthetic are the two for me. If I can watch someone do something, or do something myself, I'll have it down near instantly. (As long as it clicks in my head)\n\nFor auditory, everything just passes straight through from one ear to the other. And for reading, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ pretty much the same story there, except eyes rather than ears.\n\nNot sure why it happens, and I'd love to be able to get better at retaining stuff I read or hear, but I wouldn't know where to start with that.
2	Definitely a combination of both visual and kinesthetic. I have to see whatever im learning being performed(like holding a fork properly) or being written out(like a math equation being solved) and then after that I solidify whatever it is by doing whatever I learned.
1	I'd say I learn best with a combination of either of them with kinesthetic. As long as I'm given an example so I can copy it, then modify the technique to fit my own style.
14	The ISFP struggle when dating	People always tell me I’m an extremely likable person, but yet I’ve always had trouble romantically.  In past relationships I’ve been told that I seem too uninterested and that I don’t put enough “work” into things such as making plans.  Also, people have taken offense from me wanting to be alone sometimes, but that’s just an integral part of who I am.\n\nIt just seems like my personality is not the best for long-term relationships.  Making friends is very easy, but anything more is extremely difficult.\n\nCan anyone else relate to this or perhaps share some advice?
9	I relate to this so much! Especially past me.\nI now have a long term partner and i felt a connection as soon as we met. I enjoy alone time and sometimes my friends don’t understand why i don’t wanna hang out because i’m recharging. Now i live with my partner and get bored and lonely when she’s not around. Which took some getting used to for me because i always liked alone time ahaha. \nWe’re both extremely introverted (she’s an INTP) we need time to recharge when we’ve been around our friends, but now we recharge together. We found that as soon as we met we both wanted to spend absolutely every single minute of the day together. I’ve never felt this sort of connection with anyone, because i am an extremely independent person. \nI think we’ve just got to connect with the right person, as soon as you find someone you connect so strongly with, it’ll all work out in the end! I found myself wanting to plan to do things and get out to spend as much time with her as possible. \nGood luck! You’re doing fine, keep being yourself!  :) 
4	I can relate and often think the same thing. I enjoy the company of others, but I usually will hit a limit and need some 'me' time. It makes it difficult to invest the unwanted time into another person. Although, socially speaking, it would be nice to connect with someone on a higher level. I don't have advice other than what one of my favorite people would say "I like you as you are" - Fred Rogers.
1	I get along with most people, but, romantically, can only recall 1 time where I deeply connected with someone. I'm single now, and although I have opttions where I could date - I just don't connect enough to where it's more than just friendship or whatever. Frustrating at times, and I am in awe of how people can just so easily get into romantic relationships so easily. 
0	Are you uninterested on purpose?\n\nAlso you're female, right?
7	Do you like being isfp	Is there another type that you know you're not but you wish you were? Some websites show isfp to be the "worst" type (I know there's no worst type but read similarminds.com has to say about us). Do you mind having a biased negative connotation to us or are you indifferent to how others think of you?
7	Personally, i love being an ISFP. I’m artistic and creative and i love our type! i can’t really imagine myself as any other. I do think sometimes we’re all way too hard on ourselves, and criticism can be very personal - but i don’t wish i was any other type. Maybe sometimes i wish i was slightly more extroverted, but that’s about as far as it goes. \n\nI’m not sure i’ve come across the particularly negative traits that make us sound really bad, although i’ve read a few ‘disadvantages’ but don’t all websites claim that each type has these? \n\nI’ve met a few people who wished they were ISFP’s and a few people that have rolled their eyes, but we got to remember it’s just one personality test after all. :) 
5	I am an INFP and I had a phase where I wished I were an ISFP. I had too many thoughts in my head and wanted to be down-to-earth and *chill* like ISFPs. I learned to use meditation to my benefit and now I'm okay. I guess everyone wishes they were another type at one point or the other.
3	If I could switch to an ENTJ for a few days that would probably really benefit me lol. Overall, I'm happy being ISFP and I feel like a lot of us know how to accept ourselves for who we are (coming from a type 4 btw)
4	i still sometimes wish i can be esfp just bc in my dreams i would be completely outgoing and never get tired of being with people. even then i know i could never be an esfp so it doesn't bother me much at all. i've come across negative comments about isfp for being too private and hard to open up but i love the fact that im reserved and it takes work to get to know me. i personally love being an isfp and i get defensive reading negative comments about us 
3	I wouldn’t mind being ESFP I guess.  I can pretty extroverted sometimes, but I really wish I had that kind of energy and charisma.
3	If i could be more outgoing, I'd like to be more like that. Otherwise, I'm fine with being an ISFP. 
2	I once wished i was Esfj, Infj, Infp, Isfj. Yeah aware that there might be some negativity towards isfps on certain sites and i actually mind it. Think the descriptions of isfps online dont do us a favour. Anyway sometimes i dont like being isfp but at other times i do. But i certainly would prefer isfps to stand out though. 
2	Kind of a strange question since it boils down to how much you appreciates yourself and how much you identify with a certain type, in this case isfp. \n\nOn the other hand if you feel like you need to work on becoming a better person, meaning you wish to develop new traits or lose then bad ones then does that turn you into a different type?\n\nAnyways sorry I dont have an answer for your question, but theres no point in letting people's type ranking or whatever get to you. After all it is just another person's opinion. You get to decide for yourself whether its true or not.
1	Some of the negative connotations associated with ISFPs I can see why some people would think, others seem pretty biased. I don’t mind claims that we are unambitious or indecisive. However claims of  us being “intellectually challenged” or “selfish” are bullshit IMO
1	When I take the MBTI test as 'who do I wish I was', I get ESFJ, which I've been told would probably be my 'perfect match' and I can definitely see it. It makes sense I'd wish to be more extroverted and the kind of person who thinks of others before their own internal values.\n\nNonetheless, no, I like being an ISFP. I *am* flighty, artistic, and emotional. I enjoy being 'quirky' and jumping from one thing to the next or throwing myself into emotions, expressing myself through art or writing and being able to impress people with things like that.
1	love it! I used to type as INTP!
1	Wow, those similarminds descriptions seem to be "E types are good, I types are bad" almost across the board... though ISFP has pretty much nothing positive about it in the description.  \n\nEvery type has its strengths and weaknesses so I'm not sure I'd want to be another type at this point. When I was in high school I wanted to think of myself as an INTJ, or at least the positive qualities of one that people kept listing in tests.
1	I used to type as INFP, but that was the result of a personality test and I wanted to believe I was one because it was more realistic than me being what I actually wish to be more like: ENFP\n\nAlso I didn't really have a good grip of what the cognitive functions are. I don't want to be more like ENFPs because of others' opinions though, it's just personal.
1	Only issue is our natural inclinations tend not to fit with financially rewarding careers. I feel like a E_TJ get shit done type would find it easier to find a financially rewarding career that matches their interests.
6	Are you pursuing/ will you pursue a career based off your passions, or one that will bring you the highest paycheck?	I always wanted to be a musician for the pit orchestras on braodway. Didn't work out too well because I wasn't willing to put in the time and effort to really master the craft of music. It's still a hobby and I find any opportunities that I can still play here and there.A\n\n Now I'm going to school to be a biochemist and it's working out really well. I'm excited to work in the field even though it's not my "artistic" passion.\n\nDo you make your living as a full time "artist" and get a low paying job in order to feel happy or are you okay with working a common job to live comfortably? Maybe you tried following your passion but failed and ended up like me or other opposite: you ignored your passion and got a dead beat job somewhere that you now hate.
3	Laboring for money has a negative effect on my passions.
2	I'm a writer but I write smut because smut pays well and I can crank it out easily. I personally find it makes me feel good to be working in a field that aligns with my passions and skills, even if it's not how I imagined I'd become a writer when I was growing up.\n\nSo I guess kinda both :P I don't think I could have a mind-numbing office job working day in day out on things I don't care about. It sounds like you've been able to find a passion and excitement in biochemistry. \n\nAt one point I thought about entering the field of biology. I quickly lost interest - but chemical and biological science is probably much more interesting to an ISFP IMHO than physics or engineering for example.
1	Im fine working a common job as long as it pays and i'm secure. I have been in an art job before but it didnt turn out good for me. 
1	hopefully passion. it'll probably turn into paycheck though. I've yet to actually get a job, and eventually, I'd like to be a meteorologist. 
1	It's weird that I'm ISFP because I base my major life plans in the most logical, most likely to succeed ones. I'm trying to be a nurse so I can have a career, and then I'll be able to afford traveling. I don't want to be 30+ still bartending.

11	Do you ever get really stressed when you lose something important?	Yesterday, I realized I had lost my wallet when I got home. I wasn't too woried about it because I was tired and I didn't want to make a big deal about it. When I told my partner he freaked out and started looking everywhere for it. I knew it wasn't stolen because I put it in my pocket when I left my car so I must have put it down somewhere in our house.\n\n Long story short he got his whole family looking for it which  made everyone else stressed out and loud which in turn made me stressed, but not because of had lost my wallet lmao. It was because everyone else was tense and in my face and asking me the same questions over and over again. In the end I found it right outside my car (I missed my pocket I guess).\n\nSo my question today is, do you lose things frequently? I almost never lose important articles but trivial stuff I lose all the time. Do you get anxious when you lose important things, or do you try and stay calm and relaxed?
2	Very. I've once had my phone in my left hand, touched my pocket with my other hand, didn't feel the phone there and flipped for a minute. That's how bad it gets for me.
1	Man i get anxious as hell, whenever I feel my usually wallet thick pocket and all i feel is air, that gets me super paranoid and extremely worried. \nI usually dont really lose things cuz I'm always making sure my things are around. But when i happen to lose something there is that sickening feeling that you're about to lose alot of important stuff. 
1	I'm with you on others being more freaked out about me losing stuff than I am. Take it from someone who left their bag on the bus which had their laptop and a $50 book in it. \n\nWhen I realised it was not on my back I did go into adrenaline mode, but once I'd taken all the steps to try and get it back (like calling the transport info lines and asking security at the station) it quickly turned into resignation. "Well... fuck. There goes my stuff I guess... At least most of my important files were backed up on GDrive. And I did learn some cool stuff from that book, so I guess it wasn't a total waste."\n\nMeanwhile my friends are like "DUDE HOW THE FUCK DID YOU NOT NOTICE YOU WERE MISSING YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING BACKPACK WTF"\n\nThat plus the many DS games I've lost on public transport means my friends do not trust me at all with borrowing things to take home. To which I respond, "Fair enough haha".
3	Which kind of instruments do you like in music?	Also which instruments/sounds do you typically tend to focus on when listening to music? \n\nTo me bass is often important, I also like the repeating piano chords in the background ([kind of like in this one](https://youtu.be/Y5Cj2FVzrsk?t=2m52s)). I usually notice sounds that are more in the background than those in the forefront.
6	I absolutely love piano. I think it’s gorgeous, powerful, emotional and can also be incredibly relaxing. Something about the sound is just incredibly pleasing to me.  :) 
2	Fast beat piano or keyboards are pretty cool. Also love basslines.
1	uh  \nsynthesized ones, max/msp  \nas for real instruments, i think the most beautiful sound in the world is this 7 string electric bass  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFWjkku2qjQ
1	Piano, Bass, Saxophone, and any String instrument.
1	Guitar, acoustic and electric. Pretty much anything raw blues/rock/folk
15	What ISFP "stereotypes" do you break?	Hello friends! Us isfp's are well known for our carefree attitudes and adventurous tendencies and we hate to be "shoved into a box," including the box that is the isfp personality sometimes. I am unique and although I do relate to the standard isfp model there are things about me that you wouldn't quite expect.\n\n1. I love the color grey. As the most artistic personally, grey would seem to be the least likely to be favored because it has no personality. I just love it though because it sort of represents my philosophy on life that nothing is black and white. You have to look at controversial issues from multiple perspectives to get the full picture and it ends up being somewhat of a grey area. Also it's just astheticly  pleasing bc it brings out the vibrancy all the other colors. \n\n2. I learn best with concepts, not applications. Generally, personalities with the S trait only want to learn unless there is a practical application to it. For me, learning the application before the concept can be really confusing bc in the real world there's always exceptions but learning a theoretical model can make things much more simple and easy to understand. Once the concept is understood, the application to that concept can flow right in. I know I'm iSfp and not iNfp because I'm naturally a perfectionist and I tend to be better at pointing out differences in minute details than others. \n\n3. I SUCK at creating my own artistic works but I'm great and taking what others create and adding my own personality to them. For some reason if I have a blank mind, it will stay blank. But if I'm inspired somehow by someone else's creativity I get so full of ideas.\n\nSo that's me, but what kind of uniqueness do you bring to the isfp table? Maybe an uncommon hobby or habit that you wouldn't think a standard isfp would do. I know it can be hard to open up but I think it's fun to get some perspective into the lives of others. Also, I'm thinking about trying to regularly post here to get some insight on how people like me live and maybe make some knew like-minded friends allong the way :) Cíao! 
4	I'm very lazy and inactive and only really go outside if it's necessary, I'm way more active on the Internet. I also discuss theories and concepts a lot, even more than my intuitive friends, as long as I'm interested in those. I also don't mind shallow stuff in music or any medium, as long as it's aesthetically appealing and/or fun. I'm also quite easily stressed when things don't go the way I planned, except if it changes in a positive way. Finally, I'm extremely conservative with food and will rarely if ever try new food, I have a very small amount of food I like. I'm really the opposite with music and stuff, so idk.
5	1. Except when it comes to controlling desires, I am not impulsive at all. I spend weeks considering anything I buy, try (usually fail) to plan exactly what I’m going to say when approaching someone new, and I usually won’t get together with friends unless they’re the one to suggest it.\n\n2 I’m very interested in and good at science. I definitely prefer art (specifically photography, film, and music), but I LOVE physics as well, and ecology, and computer science. And math is always a highest mark for me, I rarely get below a 97-98 on it, whereas with artistic classes I tend to do badly, though that might be because I’m too much of a perfectionist to get all the work done. Which does fall into the ISFP stereotype pretty well. :P\n\n3. I like philosophy and abstract stuff. I actually made an abstract film for a final project once. But anyway, I’ve had conversations about philosophy that lasted hours. The key is I have to have a reason to care, I don’t debate about metaphysics for example, because I just don’t see how it impacts me. 
4	i do not like art
2	I'm super easy to "get to know". I may be inarticulate or long-winded  and confusing, or unpredictable- but never shy or mysterious LOL
1	I don’t mind confrontations and at times even seek them out (but only because I thought that there was no other option)
1	Supposedly we are spontaneous? I'm not sure to what degree, but I hate random chaos, especially not of my own doing～and no one's ever called me spontaneous or disorganized (although I am messy). That's what threw me off for so long. But a little of that comes from fam issues as opposed to personality. 
1	i'm not artistic at all
1	Not very Artistic or creative. I have a slight interest in art, but not much. I absolutely love music though. \n\nAlso, not sure if this breaks anything, but my favorite color is actually a tie between red and black. I can't decide which of those colors i personally like more.
1	I hate maths, sports and I'm as idealistic as a stereotypical INFP. Also I like to stand out (visually, if not socially). 
8	When I Have a crush on someone i shut down- help?!	Alright. I'm pretty good at being my carefree, weird self when I'm in the right mood to socialize or when I've warmed up to someone. BUT for some reason when I have a big crush on someone I kind of shut down when I talk to them and everything feels awkward and like I'm pushing them away or don't like them? This really happens when there are other people around and the person I have feelings for approaches me... does this happen to anyone else? Ugh. I'll send a text like "hey can we talk after such and such event?" and then when they approach me at the event asking what I wanted to talk about I'm like "oh, that was really nothing..." like ?!? wtf me?! Then, when we hang out alone eventually I warm up to talking to them and everything is fine and I can be myself again and have a great time. I feel like I'm giving really mixed signals and I'm worried I'm going to push them away.\ndoes this happen to anyone else? How did you fix it??
7	You're putting too much pressure on yourself and putting them on a pedestal. You don't know them well enough so obviously you are idealizing a perfect version of them. Realize they have plenty of flaws just like all of us and stop thinking about them too much..in create some weird fantasies in our heads. 
4	Isfps who have once mistyped as infjs. What things led you to that result before finally finding out you're isfp? And have u been unhappy finding out you're isfp before?	
7	I used to mistype as an INFJ when I was younger. I honestly don’t know much about mbti, but younger me thought I was more principled than I am, had not yet tried an artistic medium that spoke to me and had not really gone through any tests in life that made me realize what is truly important to me (family, being able to support the ones I love, being able to have time for myself). I’m more practical and less idealistic than I would have admitted when I was younger. no idea if any of that is helpful.
6	With a really basic glance at the code dichotomies, I typed myself as an INFJ. When I’m really depressed, I relate even more to INFJ. Online tests usually type me as ENFP but that never seemed right. After looking at the functions and learning about them, I’m definitely an ISFP. \n\nI can see how a sad PrincessBloom looks like an INFJ because I get stuck in my head and worry about what people think and what I should do, and pretty much everything so I try to be more prepared. I can also see how a happy and healthy PrincessBloom looks like an ENFP because I’m fairly social for an introvert and I really love new experiences and individualist values are always important to me. \n\nSince learning about the functions, I recognize that Fi is definitely my frame of reference and I’ve realized how big of an influence Se has on me. I love novelty and love new things. I think this is why I am typed as an Ne sometimes because they also love novelty. But I relish and crave sensory experiences more than ideas and I love to experience new things and then think about them later and process what I learned and what it might mean or how I can use it. I’m also really active and being active, especially outdoors, makes me happy and really helps center me. \n\nI think ISFPs have a bad reputation for being stupid, shallow, and self-righteous, but that doesn’t bother me too much because I don’t take it seriously. I think most people really into the MBTI are in a self-crisis, at least I was when I got into it and the better I feel, the less I think about it. I also think the stereotypes against ISFP are tossed around by unhealthy people making unhealthy judgments or they are people who have poorly developed emotional intelegence and refuse to see any value in emotions and claim to only be logical thinkers who are immune to emotional bias, even though they are making judgments about other types off of their own emotional bias. A lot of the stereotypes about ISFPs aren’t true or they are exaggerated. Such is life. \n\nAre you an ISFP who mistyped as an INFJ? Are you an INFJ who is considering they might be an ISFP but they are reluctant to admit it? Would you be disappointed to be an ISFP? If yes, why do you think that is? 
3	I always tested as an INFJ when I was younger, but since taking the test again as part of a project, I was consistently ISFJ/ISFP. I'm slightly more perceiving, but could really go either way. \nSimilar to what pgf said, I've become more practical and went through difficult situations in life as I got older. I think growing up and having work experience, having to pay bills, etc brought out my sensing side. Going through school K-12 and then college requires more intuition, but in the working world, I think sensing is used more often. My preferences just changed as my experiences changed, and I adapted to my environment.\n
2	The practicality of work brings out the sensor in all of us im sure but do u prefer being a certain type? And how did you feel about being caught in between isfj and p?
6	What are the things that piss off an isfp?	
23	Making extreme assumptions or judgement calls for me. It’s hard to explain but whenever someone does that, there’s this dark, brutal part of me that’s hurting and wants to lash out at them for even thinking of it. Like what makes you think you know me so much better than myself that your autonomy extends over mine? Usually it’s just acquaintances/classmates/guys I don’t know doing this.
11	Lately less and less things piss me off, but something that still works is mocking or hating on something I like. Just saying it is shit isn't enough, but doing it in a satirical/sarcastic tone really pisses me off.
10	1. People who always have to control and micro-manage. Correcting things that aren't even wrong. Cleaning things that aren't even dirty.\n\n2. People whose main hobby is judging people, spreading rumors, and slowly cutting down the people around them.\n\n
7	People ignoring me and looking down on me
6	Not giving me space when I need it, expecting an immediate response when I need time to think. Typical introversion. \n\nLately I've also been more prone to conflict with people who violate my morals (which imo are pretty standard). Can't stand it when a person say steals something and then brags about getting away with it.
3	this doesn't really piss me off but it still irks. but when i hang out with someone and they plan out the entire day with exact set times we need to do things by is kinda annoying i feel like i don't have a lotta time to just chill out and breathe without feeling rushed to do sumthn else ya know?
4	People.
2	For me ever since I was a kid, people who are difficult to work with. Minor inconveniences where things could be easier but people are making it harder for themselves. Too much idealism.
1	My thoughts exactly
3	Dating and Marriage with an ENTP	Hey Y'all, \n\nJust wondering if any other ISFP's here are dating/married to ENTP types and what that is like for you. 
1	Does entj count? 😂
1	I have heard they are natural enemies lol \n\nIt's always nice to hear of unusual couples though!
9	I have questions for you	Hellooooo!\n\nI'm an infj and this sub's been a little calm these days, so I figured I'd get around to asking some questions about you guys I've always wondered. I'd appreciate any response, Happy Tuesday! \n\n1) What do you normally think about/wonder (/when you're alone, if they differ)?\n\n2) Do you enjoy taking yourself out on dates/doing things alone, or is it hard to enjoy because you'd rather experience things with others?\n\n3) How do you reward yourself?\n\n4) What are your guilty pleasures?\n\n5) What/Are there things/habits you've always wanted to do, but haven't? Why?
7	1) People, myself. When I'm alone my thoughts are more free and less depressive\n\n2) Mmm it depends. To an amusement park or movies I'd rather go with friends or family for example, going to some random place by myself is fun. And I prefer doing things by myself at home usually. \n\n3) With naps, alone time, sweet food. \n\n4) Obsessing over colours (and their meaning in my life) \n\n5) Mmh I've always wanted to be organized and super productive. For me that still remains a dream though hahaha;;; (i'm scattered as hell)
5	1) i normally think about historical people, that there is no point to life, about dinosaurs, outer space and if there are life forms on it, about mbti/enneagrams, about other people's types, about work etc. \n\n2) i like doing things with others but i'm usu self sufficient and independent so i would say depending on what kind of situation and activity.\n\n3) By eating/ buying materialistic items\n\n4) Fast food is one of them.\n\n5) I've always wanted to be more organized and on time but clearing it's working the opposite lol. I need to stop on procrastination which is my biggest downfall 
2	1) it’s really random. After work I could be thinking about work and co workers or friends. I could stress about school. Or I can stumble upon traveling videos on YouTube and envision my future self traveling the world. \n\n2) I love taking myself out on dates alone. I’m 21 and sometimes I just don’t have anyone to go on little adventures with me, but I don’t let that stop me. I have a lot of fun regardless. \n\n3) I can reward myself by planning a fun weekend with friends. We’ll go out to bars or festivals/concerts. Or even just travel around the state. If it’s a small reward maybe I’ll buy myself clothes or good food lol. \n\n4) guilty pleasure would be smoking weed at night lol. I know it’s not the healthiest thing to do but sometimes after a long day of work or school nothing beats smoking a bowl and chilling out watching the office until I fall asleep. Either Netflix or listen to music till I fall asleep. I want to buy a good vape so It’ll be a lot smoother on my lungs. Idk Sometimes I can smoke weed every other night for a month, and then the next month not touch it at all. It varies\n\n5) so I keep wanting to join a rock climbing gym and eventually go out to real rock climbing destinations with people. I don’t join now because it’s a little pricey and I’m a broke college student. I also would like to learn to surf but I dont have that much free time other than a Saturday morning but I’m usually lazy and like to sleep in. 
2	1) I feel like I am always thinking but rarely remember what I thought about later in the day or if asked. **EDIT\n\n2)I love taking myself out on dates. I will take myself to a fancy restaurant for a steak, wine and a Manhattan with desert. But most often my dates (alone) are long drives through mountain passes to remote towns where I walk around and go on short hikes to local sights (hot springs, lakes, interesting trees ect.)\nBut I also enjoy doing these things with others if they will appreciate it\n\n3) I typically reward myself by sleeping in/taking a nap or buying a more expensive bottle of scotch.\n\n4) Staying up late eating pizza hut stuffed crust pizza and playing video games with my roommates from college and drinking PBR.\n\n5) I really want to hike the three major long distance trails in America. Particularly the Appalachian Trail. I haven't because I'm lazy, poor, and the timing has worked out because of work opportunities and getting married (soon). I think I will be able to in the future so long as my wife will be okay with me dipping out for 4-5 months. \n\n** **EDITED FROM**I actually have noticed recently I don't think/wonder all that much. (in honesty I probably do and I'm just being self aware at this point in life) If I do its about what ever is happening immediately around me and typically in nature/while reading. 
2	I dont think i ever felt sorry for me being irresponsible cuz since i chose this path i cant say anything or i dont deserve any pity for myself. But ive been looking at what im spending recently and trying not to over indulge. Hope to do something about my self control before it goes to a point of no return. 
1	1) I love to think about complexity of life, how everything is created in such a perfect way; or relationships woman-man, mother-child, etc..\n2) I love going out with friends, also I enjoy being on my own. I have just started to go out on my own :))\n3) With a tv series or a coffee if I go outside\n4) Pizza and fast food\n5) Using my time efficiently \n\nwhat about you?
1	Usually when I’m with people I’ll think about them and my relation to them and how im coming across. Or just focused on what we’re doing with eachother.  When im by myself i usually just try to keep busy or listen to music, watch tv, go on my laptop, etc.  Because if i spend too much time alone, i can get really depressed and start overanalyzing my life and think about why something bad happened, or worry about shit lol\n\nNot a fan of first dates, but if i know someone and like them, i love to be around them.. for like a day or two, and then i need my space again\n\nI buy things haha\n\nI still play pokemon and can get pretty addicted\n\nI’d like to learn bass and how to cook and bake better meals
1	1. Really depends. It can be about people or complex topics.\n\n2. Depends on the place. Somewhere quiet, relaxing and not far away would be alright to go alone. \nIf it's more expensive like seeing a movie or amusement park, I want someone with me.\n\n3. gaming, science, relaxing, and often Music. \n\n4. Definitely music. Some genres across the electronic spectrum i'm a little embarrassed to listen to, but still absolutely love it. I'm very personal about my tastes in music and can even get defensive about it. \n\n5. Usually i can do most things i set my mind to, but things i haven't done that I've always wanted to? maybe travelling... I've thought about it a few times and don't usually get around much since I like to stay inside most of the time, but I've always been a little curious about the world outside my reach. Like, I've always wanted to see what Japan is like, or South Korea. I'd love to learn more about their culture and see what they consider important, not important, and just how much it differs. The only reason i haven't done it is probably because i'm too young to do that myself, and I doubt anyone in my family would consider taking me to do that. \n\n*Hope i'm not too late for this thread*
9	Where are all the isfps?	It's kinda sad that there isnt really a forum for isfps. I see alot of infj/ intp/ infp forums but nothing for isfps. And only on reddit do i see more of them. 
15	I'm here.
15	We are here, we just rarely initiate the threads. 
5	If you're not already a part of it, join the isfp Facebook group. It's amazing. It's my safe haven 😌\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2214404283/
3	But what would we talk about on these forums if there were one? Probably why there isnt. Lol
1	here!!! :D :D :D
7	You guys have any experiences with ENTPs worth sharing?	
9	My most significant experience with an ENTP was with my primary school ex-classmate. [It was the worst](http://packerstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-wurst-3.png)\n\nI'd share more but I have to go to shop so.
4	Never once have I come out of a friendship with an ENTP without having been completely torn to shreds on multiple occasions. I've learned my lesson. Don't fuck with an ENTP. Nothing to do with and ENTP is worth it. Nothing. 
3	Do not respond to unstable, argumentative ENTPs. They are not trying to debate. They just want your reaction. Mute or block if online. Walk away if real life.
2	I was friends with a narcissistic ENTP in high school. We weren't even that close, but she destroyed me emotionally in a way that took me years to recover :)
2	I avoid them and try not to engage in conversation if I'm stuck with one.
2	Oh wow everyone’s had terrible experiences with ENTPs. The only ENTPs I’ve met have been super fun and entertaining, cause I actually really like their humour. The one ENTP that I actually made pretty good friends with in particular was great, though at times he did mess with people more than I thought was okay. I also really like most of the ENTPs I’ve met online... though certainly not all. I guess online is the only place I’ve really had any bad experiences with ENTPs. 
1	My SO’s bestfriend was an ENTP and they are both critical and moody sometimes but actually clicked well until ENTP kind of ghosted him everywhere except work. 
1	Had a really close friendship. She was great and caring but she made some critical remarks (it was while we were working on something) in a way that kinda destroyed me? I normally don't get that emotional but I literally stopped went to the bathroom and cried. I didn't say anything, put it away and continued our friendship. \n\nShe moved away and really stopped putting effort into the friendship which I am still trying to get over today.
1	My best friend is an ENTP and we're like peas in a pod. He's really entertaining, understanding and we're very close. We have had many debates about things but he is always understanding and listens to every point of view, and never makes it argumentative, it's always more of a discussion. I also think he has a great sense of humour - we find each other hilarious. I don't think I've had a bad experience with an ENTP, but I don't really know very many, the ones I know seem to be fine though!
6	What to do when an ISFP hits bottom? Do you ever realize it? How do you get out of your rut?	We have this link stickied at the top of our ENTJ group - I've linked the ISFP version for discussion... It's very spot-on for my ISFP. \n\nhttp://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/SEI-ISFp/\n\nDo you ever catch yourselves when you're bottoming out? When work or home life is crashing? When your health is poor and getting worse? When a SO is about to leave you? \n\nThe link mentions reluctance to think about the future - does that ever change?\n\nEven in trying times, when I've had to snap my ISFP out of his coma - he'll slip back into it once all hell stops breaking loose. \n\nDoes the world really need to be falling down around your shoulders to get your attention? Do you worry about your health, your job, your relationships? What would make you do something about it? \n\nAs an ENTJ, I just have to let most things go or I'm seen as harsh, then I look up and my ISFP is completely gone! Why make me the bad guy? I don't want to be! \n\n**SEIs are often highly disinclined to engage in productive tasks, and may be inclined to react to "responsible" individuals or environments as overly somber, cold, or dull. They often see the hustle and bustle of working concerns to be insignificant, preferring to focus on their own comfort and friendships.**\n\nSo, how do you guys not get fired? Mine had his mother take him aside in his *late* 20's and give him a heads up that he was about to get the ax because (issues)...  He's well old enough not to get this lecture again, but it could happen. \n\nI don't want to be his mother figure. \n\nAny insights? \n\nIf not, do you see this in yourselves? \n\n\n\nThanks!

2	ISFP is ESI in socionics (ISFj). The j/p are flipped for introverts in socionics.\n
2	As another user mentioned you posted socionics for isfj, but I did read esi (for isfp), lie (entj), and their relationship. The socionics entj sounds so carefree compared to mbti entj. I was actually reading dual relationship descriptions with esi and lie, and it sounds really appealing to me. I might seem carefree to my coworkers but I’m actually worried and serious almost all the time. Socionics says entj is romantic, creative, good at long term planning, not petty, democratic, and appreciative of isfp’s talents. As isfp, I relate to the description of isfp being pragmatic, loyal, and hardworking/disciplined. But I don’t think most entjs can handle the emotional outbursts isfps have sometimes. I really like the description of lie and esi though— it sounds appealing to need someone and to be needed, and lie sounds very attractive to me— but mbti entj seem more rigid, logical, and demanding especially entjs in the Reddit sub.\n\nAs for your isfp guy— he needs to want to learn how to be disciplined and value being realistic, because, you are right; who is going to pay the bills? He needs to grow up. Thankfully, my parents taught me that hard work is essential to success, and that success is important to surviving. He may need to learn that the hard way, through physical losses. He may need to experience it to truly want to learn it, since he has not absorbed it from a young age.

1	I’m an ISFP my bottom is when I attempt suicide. I have to work myself out of it because no one tries to help. So I get help from being hospitalized or meeting with my therapist and psychiatrist. 
3	"Why do you need to understand?"	It has been some tense few months now with the ISFP (my SO).\nYesterday while having a bit of a tense but quiet, low voice almost-argument, I looked at him. He usually is very sensitive to me looking at him and looked at me in reply and asked "what are you trying to find out?" to which I replied "im trying to understand what is bothering you". Killer line: "Why do you need to understand me? Just dont do it..", said a bit angrily. I could not really reply anything in return. I know he is for some reason upset. This morning and until  now, he has not spoken to me and I still am divided between...if I should say anything or keep my guard up and let him come to me. Do you ISFPs need to feel understood, in general?
12	yes, the basis of relationships/friendships most isfps have is to seek understanding and empathy from the other party. if we do not feel connected to the other party, we would rather isolate ourselves. \n\nthe thing is when consoling/seeking to understand an isfp’s issues, break down the issues you want to resolve into smaller, more manageable questions, because isfps may get flustered talking about their complex problems. this way it gives the isfp a direction on where to start talking about an issue, and slowly they will be more comfortable opening up about the details.
7	This may just be me and not indicative of all isfp's, but when I'm upset and my SO is unsure why and asks what's wrong and I get defense and reclusive, it's usually bc I've forgotten why I'm angry. It's really frustrating bc I try and forget about the conflict (bc isfp's hate conflict) but I still feel angry so when someone tries to ask why all I have is emotion with no reason. Understandably, this can be extremely frustrating for both parties.\n\nIf given enough time I usually will remember and talk about it more gently when I'm ready but sometimes it never comes to me so that's a character flaw on my part. Not saying that this is exactly what's happening in your case but your description seems really similar to the fights me and my SO have. 
1	What type are you?\n\nEdit: INFJ- read it in your profile.
7	My ISFP friend mistyped as INFJ	Hey dudes! An INTP 9w8 here. Just wanted to share how my ISFP friend mistyped as an INFJ. She is an enneagram type 1w2, which is pretty common for INFJs. Type 1 generally made her appear more “J”, so she never considered that she was a “P” type. Her tertiary Ni is somewhat developed and I would say that she often gets into loops, making her think that her Se is lower than it actually is.\n\nMost ISFPs are enneagram types 9 and 4, and enneagram has a big impact on your personality and actions, so she doesnt at all relate to any ISFP online descriptions. After showing her the descriptions for the single functions in ISFP positions, she definately related more. She scores higher on Te in cognitive function tests, due to her enneagram type 1.\n\nI thought it would be cool to share, and to see if any of you have a more unusual enneagram for ISFPs and how that affected the processes of discovering your MBTI type?
5	[deleted]
1	Seems like the isfps i know including myself have once mistyped as infjs before. People just dont do enough research and i would have carried on being infj if i didnt have a inconsistency sniffer in me. It's the first time i heard of a 1w2 isfp and wonder if she really is one? Pardon my skepticism cuz i'm a 6w5. All along i assumed i was a 4 due to my strong emotions and 4 being where most infjs collide sounds like a fail proof thing than other types besides 5s. But eventually i found my type and it sounds more apt than the 4w5 one. I have a lot of things in common with the Js more than the Ps due to enneagram but eventually my basic functions are still isfp related. And i would add that isfps who have a more developed intuition or one that didnt go deeper into mbti will type themselves as infjs. 
1	The enneagram is too unscientific for my liking
1	The enneagram is just another attempt at doing the same thing as MBTI. and it fails miserably. That's why many people fit multiple enneagram types. ( and no, it's not like "which one you fit best", like most people literally fit *best* in *multiple* enneagrams in any possible given order.) (which of course invalidates the tritypes and etc......)\n\nI wouldn't advise to believe in any of that shit. 
6	Constant apologies	I have an ISFP friend and I also have some social anxiety, and so I tend to say things like "sorry for being annoying" routinely... do you think that you would interpret insecurities of this kind as a lack of trust? I trust her a lot, and I don't want her to think it's her fault that I'm worried about annoying her... it's a completely irrational fear and she has told me time and time again that I'm not annoying... but of course I can't ask her if the constant apologies are annoying because that would imply that I didn't trust her... I'm worried that she might translate my insecurity into me not trusting her...
6	I cant speak for everyone here but personally I would just feel bad for my friend if they constantly apologies since surely they've gone through some trauma before to make them that way.\n\nI probably wont do anything to change them or criticize though since its not my place to turn them into a different person. \n\nHowever I feel being together with someone out if pity is really a shitty thing to do and wont end well for both sides. So if the other person feel bad for you,  you'll probably just stay as their friends. \n\nAnyways Im sure you've heard before that confidence is attractive, if you want to be with the person you may want to present yourself differently.  
2	I had a friend like that. Never did it occur to me as a lack of trust. Anyways, how did your parents react to any kind of self-expression from your side? That might be worth digging into if you'd like to resolve it.
1	Did you experience trauma growing up?
4	What types are your parents?	Dad: ISTP\n\nMom: INFJ
3	My mother is an ENFP\nMy father is an ISFJ
2	If I had to make a guess, it would be:\nMom: INFP\nDad: I/ESTJ
2	Mom: ISTJ\n\nDad: I wasn't sure about his type earlier, but now I'm thinking ESTJ
2	Dad INFJ Mom ISFJ\n\nSuffice to say I won't ever meet their expectations for planning
2	I'm positive that my mom is an ESFP. My dad is probably an ISTJ.
2	Mum: ESFJ\n\nDad: INTJ\n\nYou can imagine how well my dad and I got along when I was a teenager...
1	Dad: ISFJ \nMum: ISFP \n\nEdit: I’m ENTP
1	Father: xSTJ\nMother:INFJ\n\nI think their insane J helped influence my rebellious P side
1	Dad: ISTP\nMom: INFP
1	Mom: INFP (seems a pretty classic 'Mom' type)\n\nDad: ??? I assume INTP (he's dead)
1	Mum: ESFP\n\nDad: ISTJ (not too sure)
1	Mom: ISTJ 1w2\n\nDad: ESFP cp6w7\n\nour family has too much Fi.
1	Dad: ISFJ\n\nMom: ESFJ
6	Advice on getting to Know an ISFP? From an INFP	Hey so I posted a similar question on the INFP sub Reddit but I figured I would try and go to the source for advice. Any advice or tips would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks.
7	Talk. \nListen. \nRepeat. \nI have a really good friend who is an infp and we just started texting and making plans to hangout . It took about a year but we are really close now! I find myself being more of the listener and practical one, while my friend is caught up in over analyzing and getting her feelings too involved. She thinks I’m super mature.. but okay 😂  I’m really dry in my humor and she just laughs.. but yeah, just do stuff with them and maybe in a year or two you’ll be their best friend. Maybe. 
2	Honestly I would say to initiate conversation a lot and keep the conversation flowing. I tend to be very reserved and will let the conversation run dry very quickly if the person isn't very outgoing. Ask tons of questions but also talk about yourself too.The people who I tend to open up to tend to be talkative people who make me feel comfortable. That's really important.
1	Which subtype of ISFP are you? Sensory or Feeling?	**ISFP-Fi** - The feeling subtype usually makes an impression of a modest, gentle, soft person, but in his soul he is very principled, demanding, and distrustful. It is difficult to make him change his mind. Can be very stubborn and intractable. Sensitive, prudish, dislikes imposing his company. Internally highly critical and applies his high ethical standards to other people, though may not openly voice this. If his principles are touched, he can suddenly show his character, becoming sharp and uncompromising. Hardworking and practical. - [**Full description**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESI_subtypes)\n\n**ISFP-Se** - The sensory subtype is quite strict, critical, and ironic. Categorical in conclusions and uncompromising in decisions. Internally sensitive and emotional, but tries to appear as strong, cold, self-assured person. Serious, guarded, and private. Conservative in his tastes and habits. Diligent in work, though sometimes he lacks in attention and perseverance to complete his assignments. At times seems unapproachable, arrogant, and prickly. His gaze is piercing. His face sometimes assumes a guarded expression. - [**Full description**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESI_subtypes)
7	I'm pretty sure it's actually specifying ISFJ's by accident, unless the extra socionics part changes everyone's personality type.\n\nThere's more at http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEI_subtypes, but here's the 'appearance' of ISFP:\n\nSensory-Dominant\nAppearance\n\nCalm and soft person in interaction. With his presence often pacifies others. Industrious, practical, does everything with a sense of taste. Often engages in fine arts as a hobby. Well-wishing, tactful, unobtrusive. Tries to sympathize, to assist, to provide advice. Loves rest and comfort. Likes talking about his perceptions and sensations. Attentively questions his conversation partner in regard to his or her affairs. Slightly delayed in his behavior and speech, sometimes stretching out words and with difficulty forming clear thoughts. Even if he speaks fast, he doesn't hurry to end the conversation. Able to speak about the same subject with erudition, comprehensively and at great length. Smiles with confidence, nods her or his head as a sign of support. Movements are smooth, stylish, somewhat slow; may appear to waddle and "walk like a duck". Undemonstrative, but clothes and accessories nevertheless attract attention.\n\nEthical/Feeling-Dominant\nAppearance\n\nSeems lively, friendly, and unrestrained in conversation; emotionally responsive, easily gives compliments and closes the distance, may even take his conversation partner by his hand; his lack of restraint carries a shade of familiarity. Shyness can alternate with joking remarks; ironic quips easily turn into respectful and serious tone. Often jokes and tells even unpleasant things with a smile as to not offend the other person. Precautionary and careful. From time to time his temper flares up, but he is quickly appeased and is forgiving. Usually optimistic, merry, and upbeat. Likes to give and receive pleasure. Often gives compliments to people and renders various services. Knows how to cheer up or encourage someone. Seems carefree, for he is prone to hide his negative emotions from others. Impatient and restless. Speaks quickly and confidently, with imperative, declaring intonations. Has a quickly moving gaze that notes everything, sometimes cursorily "shooting" side to side, other times deep and meaningful. His movements are assured and graceful but a bit gusty.
3	Both of these short descriptions make me feel like a huge asshole, lol.
4	I’m starting to wonder if I’m neither lol 
3	I’m one or the other depending on who I’m surrounded by.
1	Eh, both.
1	Socionics ISFp is actually SiFe (ISFJ) 
1	ISFP-Se
1	theres 8 subtypes.
11	ISFPs And Debates	I haven't seen ISFPs labeled as a type that likes to debate very often, but I haven't seen the opposite either. I was wondering what other ISFPs thought of debating.\n\nPersonally I enjoy debating, though I can only debate for a while before having to take a break. It takes a lot of mental energy for me to sort useful emotions from emotions that hinder my argument, and then implement that correctly. I typically go in spurts of debates (mostly online) where for a few days I go into a debating frenzy, but then have to avoid it altogether and recuperate.
13	I only debate when I'm interested in the topic and want to learn more. If I'm set on my opinion on an issue I won't interject and I'll most likely remove myself from the conversation. Essentially I don't care to try and sway someone else to my side, but if I'm unsure or uneducated I will let someone tell me how they feel and generally I'll come up with my own opinion based on their info.
7	There may be a chance of ISFPs that like debates, but I would assume that the majority don’t really enjoy them as it involves conflict and ISFPs aren’t fans of conflict. Personally, I’m not much for debate. Usually if I try to debate, it’s more of an exchange of ideals and information that leaves both sides the more knowledgeable.
5	[deleted]
2	Depends on the tone of the conversation. When I'm listening, I'll decide on my amount of input if the conversation is leading down a balanced path or not. Depends solely on the flow, although if I feel strongly enough about a topic I will add my opinion as often as I can fit it in. Most of the time I enjoy listening to debates, only joining in to bring all the points together or at the end of the argument after I've heard all the different perspectives. 
2	I enter debates which involve topics and agendas that I'm particularly passionate about, and don't enjoy then always. But then, I fiercely back whatever point I'm trying to get across,  with abolute relentlessness. I find debates for the sake of debating pretty repugnant though. 
1	I like online debating. I don't think I would be very good at a formal debate  (though I've never tried) because I'm constantly tripping over my words and easily riled. I listen to formal debates all the time though.
1	Debates usually go poorly for me, mainly because I only really get into them when I've been in an increasingly bad mood for awhile and my ability to refrain from telling people all the reasons why they're idiots has been whittled away.  \nPlus even when I'm not in a bad mood, debate drains my emotional energy really fast nowadays. It used to not be so bad, but the past several years of anxiety/depression/constant irritability have really taken a toll on my ability to amicably express disagreement.\n\nNote that I'm more likely an INTP than ISFP considering testing history and whatnot, though.
4	Anyone in the military	I'm currently listed, because there's a conscription based system in my country. I'm curious if there's anyone else in the military and how do they cope with the schedule and sharing your accomodation with others
2	I was really going to be surprised to see the responses here. \n\nHow are you doing in the military? \n\nMy ISFP H comes from a long line of military men, but did not go that way. I cant imagine him in the miliatry. \n\nYou going to be OK? How long are you in for? 
1	I think that the military would be really good for me and that i would enjoy certain aspects of it. I worked at a summer camp where I shared a small canvas tent with three people and had shared showers with no personal living space. I did alright for the 3 months the camp was open that summer. 
8	Dissociation	Has anyone else experienced the feeling of complete disconnection with reality? I've only felt it a few times, normally when I'm in a lot of emotional pain. However, today in class I experienced it again. I was just curious if this is common among people with this personality type. 
6	many times, i lose track of what somebody else is saying because my mind drifts off to emptiness for no reason. i feel numbed and completely out of touch with my surroundings on days like these and just can’t wait for the day to be over. sigh i hate being on autopilot 
3	Have you checked the enneagram? Dissociation, numbing out, living on autopilot, and feeling internal emptiness is very common for [Type 9s](http://www.fitzel.ca/enneagram/Type9.html).
1	That makes sense. Every time I took the quiz I had 6, but 9 sounds right. 
1	What gets you back to reality? 
1	I do this a lot. I think it’s related to being abused and neglected for so long for me. It’s always scary when it happens and I can’t just get myself to snap back. 
1	Hi, this is an old post, sorry.\n\nI experience this usually after having too much caffeine.\n\nWhat helps me is counting colors, textures, shapes, sounds, steps, ceiling tiles, looking at family pictures, and doing whatever was on "my" (haha doesn't feel like me anymore) to do list before I left normal.
2	Sense of humor.	What kind of sense of humor do you think you have? Risqué? Deadpan? Subtle? Loud? Etc... \n\n-your humble Ti dom tryna undastand "hao 2 nice peeple" 
9	A mixture between dad jokes and dead baby jokes.
4	Dank memes, Dad Jokes, sarcasm, “stupid” humor, Vine references, self-depreciating, I basically make humor whenever I can.
4	Stupid, dead pan, slapstick, crude, dark, most forms of humor i guess.
2	just slapstick and stupid humor
2	deadpan and sarcastic mostly 
2	slapstick, stupid, irony, and some dark humor.
1	Mostly Subtle I think. And making fun of people but only people that know I'm joking. 
1	I just graduated with best sense of humor in the yearbook by essentially being a living meme.  My humor (slapstick, maybe somewhat offensive) seems out of character for what people might expect from a reserved person, so it gets an reaction every time.
7	My Experience with ISFPs	Growing up, prior to knowing about the MBTI, I thought ISFPs were oversensitive people trying to act deep and who made dumb career choices. It turns out that's not the case. People often DON'T understand ISFPs, and it's because we live in a society where people are ignorant of psychology. Many people who major in psychology are even ignorant on critical aspects of psychology. This is because wrong things are taught and things limited in practicality are taught.
1	I'm just misunderstood.
1	Never understood why it has to be taught though. Cant people think and learn from their experience?
7	Cats or dogs??	I'm a dude and I like both. even though I'm allergic to cats
8	Both are cool, but i like cats more.
5	Dogs forever, but cats are cool too. 
3	Cats all the way. Dogs are cool too, but I really prefer cats. 
3	Cats
2	Fish lol
2	Definitely both.
1	I used to be super allergic to cats when I was in elementary school, found out when I went to my teacher's house where she had 3 cats and my eyes were red and had snot everywhere. \n\nDuring college tho a girl I rent apartments with adopted a stray cat and It turns out I suddenly wasnt as allergic anymore. Now I have two cats and I feel they are more smart and cute than any dogs I've had in the past. 
1	Dogs. As long as they are trained and obedient. Cats are okay, not super fond of them. Purring drives me crazy when trying to sleep
1	i love both but admittedly i do prefer dogs more 
1	dogs! but if i weren't allergic to cats theyd be okay. but still dogs!  
1	Dogs <3 I love cats too and have several, but dogs are more fun and intelligent.
1	cats
12	It is I.	It is I, your humble Ti dom once again. I read a post on this sub once, where someone pointed out the reason that this place is slow. That reason being, ISFPs for the most part would rather comment or add something to an already existing conversation, rather than starting one. Therefore I have taken it upon myself to post here, and ask you all kinds of silly questions. Feel free to get completely sidetracked in the comments. **As for this post, I've been wondering, what kinds of Enneagram types are on this sub?** http://pstypes.blogspot.com/2009/08/duniho-enneagram-test-brought-back-to.html\n\nLol "humble Ti dom" is an oxymoron
6	heyo\n\nI'm a 9w1 ISFP (tritype 954). 
3	4w5, i guess.
2	7 here. Hello 'humble Ti dom'.
2	I got 2w1, now I'm going to see what that means.
1	I’m a 6
1	I'm a 6
1	Your main type is probably 5\n\nConsidering the wings, you should be a 5w6\n\nEdit for future reading: 5 THE INVESTIGATOR - The Intense, Cerebral Type: Perceptive, Innovative, Secretive, and Isolated\n\n6 THE LOYALIST- The Committed, Security-Oriented Type: Engaging, Responsible, Anxious, and Suspicious\n\nhttps://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions/
1	Ahahah, that gave me a weird little mess.\n\nI had 12 in 2, 11 in 3, 4, and 9, and 10 in 4 and 5, with small scores in 1, 3, and 6.\n\nIt said that means I'm probably a type 2, but given the confusing results of that I think I'd have to research more enneagram to type myself.
1	any other ISFP 4's??\n\n4w3 (479 or 469 tritype)
1	Isfp 3w4
1	ISFP 4w5 / 9w1
15	Do you tease people?	IxTP here. Do you all have the tendency to tease your friends? Im not talking about like toxic mean constant teasing, but like a casual mischievous kind of teasing. (I actually think it's cute so I'm not complaining just curious) My friend does this... although she always follows up with "just kidding". I suppose she wants to make sure she doesn't hurt anyone's feelings. The weird thing is, she's friends with me, my sister, and another mutual friend ... and I'm the only one in the group who gets teased. for instance if I stutter while speaking she'll point and laugh. It's quite amusing. She does do this to her brothers though. (She's the youngest and has 2 older brothers).\n\nTl;Dr: do you tease? If so who and why?
13	I do in a loving/playful way, never mean. I would have to be VERY comfortable with you and like you a lot though. It would be horrifying if my actions caused anyone important to me to feel bad. 
3	Yes, if I'm very comfortable on the person I love doing it.
3	Constantly.  I like to remind people that I'll tease you if I love you a lot. But I still follow it up with "just kidding! I love you!"
2	I always tease and will say ‘just kidding’. But depending on if the person knows me well, I don’t say it as often. It does annoy me that I say it all the time, so I try not to, but then people end up getting offended. I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. 
2	Oh, ALL THE TIME. But I always make sure they know I’m teasing by forcing a playful laugh every time I tease someone or say something I mean as a joke.
2	All. The. Time. It's all affection though.
1	Oh, all the time. I usually leave out the just kidding part though, depending on my mood.
5	What do you feel when people use metaphors?	As in a conversation or a book.\n\nDo you hate it when people use metaphors?\n\nSuch as, \n\n>If the ISFP is the captain of a ship, feeling is the compass, sensing is the sail, and intuition is the radar.\n\n>My imagination is like Kinder eggs. You don't know what ideas you'll get, but they are all silly and pointless.
18	I think it's like this, \n\nYou know when a mother is carrying a kid upto her breast and the kid faces the opposite direction with respect to the way the mother is walking. Then you happen to be behind the mom and end up locking eyes with the kid. The kid has a weirded out look on its face and so do you. Then you don't know what to do, so you smile. Then the kid smiles back. That's how I feel about metaphors.
6	I use metaphors when I have to explain technical things to non-technical people.
5	I use a lot of metaphors myself... but I prefer using subtle metaphors, to subconsciously drive the point further in. 
2	Keep it short and sweet. If the metaphor drags on like it has to explain itself then it isnt a very good metaphor. If its done right though then its very satisfying to have another layer of understanding to the situation being explained. 
1	I prefer similes but metaphors are alright too
1	In literature I sometimes find it tiring and pretentious to the point where the metaphor is doing more harm than good to describe the context. Subtleness is important. When a metaphore is done right and feels natural it can be pretty awesome. 
16	Is it hard for ISFPs to find a romantic partner?	I've recently just gotten friendzoned by someone who I thought I could be with, and I haven't had any interest like that my entire life, up until now. I almost feel like there is no one around my area who I could like in such a way... So other ISFPs, do you find it difficult to find a romantic partner?
28	Yes, very difficult. Reflecting back, even the people I got into a relationship with I felt lacked a certain something..there was something missing in the connection. But I think ISFPs have the problem of wanting to be so deeply connected with someone (the way we are with ourselves) that no one will ever be able to meet this expectation.\n\nI frequently have crushes on people that would never date me seriously, and when I think if they would - it wouldn't last. Something would be missing. It's kind of sad, sometimes I feel like I will end up alone.
20	I feel like we're kind of made to be single haha. Either we repel relationships or run away from them. 
7	I feel like it is. I just don't connect to people in that sense even if I have a physical attraction but seems there's something missing. It has only happened once for me and I'm 42 M...  \n\nI never really thought about it until this post... time to over-think. 
7	Personally, I’m desperate to find love...which tends to make relationships impossible to form properly.
4	Never had problems dating or getting in relationships. The biggest problem was to have my introversion accepted. No one was able to understand my need for (wibbly-wobbly) time and space and everyone accused me of not loving them cause i wasn't clingy. Damn Fi.\nI solved finding an intj lol.
3	I'm going to jump in on this hopefully not too late. INFJ male who has had a serious long-term relationship with an ISFP female. I found that she was unable or unwilling to share deep emotions. Also I found that I was the more communicative person in our relationship as well as the more emotionally expressive. It does seem as though the introverted feelings do make it more difficult for ISFP to let go to open one self up to the significant other. There was history of relationship failure starting to build up within her life. It's really hard for me to describe all this because it hurts still even after 8 years. I tried my hardest to connect with her. I think she is ok making initial connection but it's the long term part she had difficulty with. Do ISFPs have difficulty persevering in relationships? 
1	For male ISFPs especially. You have the best shot with Te types like ENTJ, INTJ, INTJ, and ESTJ who value your dominant Fi: [**ISFP type matches**](http://personalitycafe.com/isfp-articles/288-love-types-isfp-11.html#post22271698)
1	I guess? Never been in the limelight. My professors barely even remember my face even if I'm always present in their class. Making meaningful attachments has been hard too, and tbh if my intp boyfriend hadn't had a drunk that night and drunkenly confessed to me I wonder where I would be now. Prolly still single.
1	YES ! SOMETIMES I THINK I WAS BORN TO BE SINGLE  😣!
3	How many novels did you read in 2017?	
1	Do graphic novels count?
11	Does anyone hear really LOVE ice cream?	Or is this not an isfp thing?
6	I love ice cream! I was actually thinking of having a bowl in just a minute
5	Best dessert! But I feel this may just be a very common preference and not an ISFP thing.
3	My favorite food. Non-ironically.
2	Absolutely. I've had to start buying pint size containers so I can limit myself to just that, otherwise I'll just keep eating it lol
1	I like tiramisu. Actually I'm not so into ice cream.
1	yes! it's the best! i love cookies and cream!
1	No. I don’t. 
1	Ugh now I want ice cream, but I don't think I have any. :c
5	How to get yourself out of a fi-ni loop?	Any ideas?
5	I currently find myself in this loop as well. \nHow do you describe the fi-ni loop? \nUsually fi-ni loop in isfps is defined as paranoia particularly social paranoia, people are talking behind you're back about you or someone is out to get you. \nBut I'm still interested to here what particularly iris that makes you think you are in the loop, maybe I can give more advice
5	Use Se.
2	What is fi-ni?
0	ISFP chicks be like	
12	[deleted]
7	You bitter bro? That's insulting to say she's iSFP lol
5	Rude
1	HOLY CRAP, I'M TRASH FOR 90 DAY FIANCE \n\nBut to say I'm anything like Anfisa is an insult lol
1	LOL I don't think ISFP girls are like that but that video was hilarious. I really hope they didn't get married cause that's gonna be an expensive mistake for him
2	Question for ISFPs who read novels.	How do you find the sensory descriptions in novels, good or lacking?\n\nAre they limited compared to your own perception of the world or are you able to fill in the details with your imagination?\n\nDo you prefer detailed description or description telling only the most important details?
5	Gosh I hate it when authors write about the scenery and little details. I love good character development and interesting plots. 
3	It depends on the novel and the writer. If it's outside environment is not that important to me, I'm ok with just having some indications and I'll fill in the gaps. Even if I get additional info further on, it's ok. When it's the inside of buildings, houses, I prefer having details about the plan, the light, the colours, the objects so that I can make the right image in my head and play what I read as a movie. I don't like it when I imagine a door on the left and later on the writer mentiones someone going through the door ON THE RIGHT. It messes up the picture I had and sometimes I have to re-imagine the room and stuff inside...ugh.
2	It depends on the type of book. Usually I get bored if the author does way too detailed of a description of a place, but sometimes it's necessary or well written enough that it is OK.  If the book is funny (Hitchhiker's Guide) then the descriptions are the best part.  Like others who responded, I make the book play out like a movie in my head, and if the scene is frozen to fill in minute unnecessary details over and over again with the characters actually doing something every 5 minutes, then I might as well not watch....
6	Fuck	so you are telling me there actually is a type of introvert that kinda hates reading, thinking and living a well organized life?\n\nMy whole life was a lie\n\nNow I finally make sense to me\n\n
9	[deleted]
3	I love philosophy and thinking... I just don't care for philosophising endlessly on irrelevant things. For instance, I hate metaphysics, because there's no real way to push that beyond mere speculation, and I'm not going to change my life based on that in any way.\n\nEpistomology, ethics, and aesthetics are relevant though, so I like them. c:
2	I like reading, not necessarily books tho and I definitely like thinking (you most likely do too) but "thinking" is very vague. \n\nI've been told I think about certain things on so many different levels that's it's suprising that I can even function without having a crippling anxiety, but at the same time I don't think about many other things that other people think about on a daily basis. Most of my thinking is introspective (your post too indicates some level of introspective thinking, doesn't it?).
9	What are your favorite subreddits?	Just curious about what other ISFPs like to read on reddit!

4	When there’s no ice cream 
1	Haha yeah!!!
1	Well you're not WRONG...
1	Hahaha
28	How many times have you started a reply on reddit only to delete it?	I've done this hundreds of times, and I thought I'd make a thread about it after doing it just now.  It's like ... does this really contribute?  And the guy's post was a day ago, it's not worth bothering.
23	*waves at people who want to reply but deleted it*
15	I literally just did this 3 times in a row to a post in r/mbti . I do this fairly often. \n\nI think it’s because I feel like what I have to say isn’t necessary, and because I’m afraid someone will reply telling me I’m wrong or something negative. 
5	Honestly, I've probably done that about as much as I've actually replied, lmao. Usually it's either because I suddenly get afraid of how people will react, or because I just get too lazy to actually finish the reply.
3	Story of my life 
3	A lot of times.
1	I do this too often.  Mainly because my ideas don’t always have the same effect once they’re on a page.  It’s not necessarily that they’re invalid, just different than I wanted.  I try to avoid leaving any bad impressions in life, and that’s sort of a part of it.
7	Share your own art!	So a while ago I made the "Share your art stuff tastes" thread, but this isn't that. I've seen on the INFP subreddit that people just post their art as a thread often, but that doesn't happen here. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm guessing that's because in such a small group we don't want to put ourselves on a pedestal since it won't be buried beneath other posts soon, lol.\n\nSo basically I made this so you can share whatever art you've made here that you want to! It can be drawing, photography, music, film, dance... anything! I know not all ISFPs do art, but I thought this would be nice for the ones that do. c:
7	[deleted]
4	This is fun idea! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/P7Gmf\n\nI included two recent photos I took and some of my favorite artworks. I do a lot of  portraits, with markers. My art isn’t really “imaginative” or “creative” but I do enjoy simply drawing/recreating what I see in my own style. I also love photography, mostly nature, self-portraits, and taking pictures of my kitties! 
2	I still like [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq5HS6w7oM) I wrote a few years ago.
2	I took [this picture](https://imgur.com/gfhLyfb) the other day that I really liked.  \n\nI much preferred the smoke pattern in [this one](https://imgur.com/6H9Xe4u), but the sky colors weren't coming out as nicely, and my attempts at editing still weren't getting it to a good enough point for it to be satisfying.\n\nAlso I've been really wanting to paint the last frame of [this video](https://youtu.be/cVsQyRiGxsk) in watercolor, but a combination of not being sure whether I want to do it in color or b&w plus not actually having any paints or decent paper has been postponing actually doing it.
2	On summer i drew for 1 week or so, i stopped drawing after that, this is my last drawing https://i.imgur.com/oUjFXM4.jpg
1	Okay, this is a work in progress but what I have so far is complete. There's going to be some ambience at the beginning and one more part, but I'd call this my best piece yet. https://soundcloud.com/threeblacksevens/eternality\n\nI made it on an app called Beatwave, it's pretty cool. I'd love to have a recording studio to record real instruments though, lol.
3	What is necessary to have a successful and happy romantic relationship with you, ISFPs?	
17	I don't know about romantic relationships, but for relationships in general I think the biggest thing is I need to be assured that I'm not a nuisance, or I end up pulling away. Actions I find are the best to get this across, because I'm quite distrustful of people's words. Though if it's really well said, words can be just as effective.\n\nAlso, in the early stages of any relationship I'll very rarely be the one to initiate conversations, activities, etc. Later though, once I'm 100% sure it's going to work out fine, I'll be outgoing enough to be an extravert, lol.\n\nI also think it's important to let the ISFP have their alone time, but be careful if they start to withdraw too often, because they may be nervous to talk to you for some reason. So if that happens, don't get angry, but definitely reach out and try and get things rolling again. This one may not be an ISFP thing in general, but I may as well put it here in case it is, other people can verify it or say it's not an ISFP thing.
6	I've visited this post a few times being too lazy to reply.\n\nWhat's necessary to have a happy romantic relationship is: appreciation, physical affection, acceptance, adventure.
3	Been in a successful relationship with an ENTJ for 7 years which I have recently read would not work because we are complete opposites. I think we respect and admire each other's differences to the point that love was very easy to blossom. I help him achieve his goals with my emotional intuitiveness and intellect and don't cramp his style because I am self sufficient. I respect his focused and driven demeanor and his assertiveness was quite flattering in the early stages when he was pursuing me. So I'm the confident competent support system that he needs and he adds to my life by imparting some of his focus onto me and inspiring me to step out of my comfort zone and experience a different way of doing and seeing things. \nFor myself I needed\nDeep discussion about philosophical ideas, past present future kinda pondering - basically connecting on a deep emotional level \nFun adventurous dates - never want to get bored or feel stuck in a rut \nCore values must be in sync and have a partner willing to listen, learn and grow together. Hope this helps- just learnt about this psychology stuff today and this is my first reddit post yay
2	Our dominant Fi gives us strong moral ideas, and a difference in viewpoint to us can potentially cause conflict. We most likely want to be open-minded however, and accept when we are wrong, and the best way to do that is to appeal to our Te.\n\nExplain your side of any argument in a logical concise manner, in a way that doesn't target us personally. That's the best way to change my viewpoint about something, anyway. Personally, I don't like any kind of conflict, but in any kind of long relationship I'd prefer for the other to be honest (instead of holding grudges) so that I could feel comfortable doing the same. It's a little similar to what people have been saying so far, being honest about how you feel to your ISFP can reassure them that they're not a nuisance, at make them feel more comfortable with opening up to you.
5	Extremely depressed after graduation, thinking about switching professions	So throughout my life, I've loved to try new experiences, I've loved to build things with my hands, I've loved to create physical sculptures, to see the fruits of my labors. In high school, I got into game development, thinking that it would be a good intersection of an artistic and lucrative profession.\n\nThrough the end of high school and all through college, I had this dream of being an indie game developer, thinking I'd one day be able to make a game that was lucrative enough to dig me out of this hole that I felt I was living in. I think it was this dream of not having to work the corporate 9-5 that kept me going. So somehow, I actually find an opportunity to pull this off, to get some funding and start a company. However, now that things have calmed down, I've never felt more unfulfilled in my life. \n\nAll I've ever wanted ever, since I was just a kid, was a girlfriend, and yet, I've never been able to get one. For some reason, I felt that having money would be enough, but as I have finally gained financial independence, I can see (and to many this is obvious), that this is such a small part of the equation.\n\nI think part of the reason I can't find someone is that I act really desperate, because the truth is I am. Programming feels like rock compared to the clouds and water and fire of love. I'd don't love programming, I don't love myself so I'm desperate to find emotional fulfillment somewhere else.\n\nIt seems to me that finding a job that hits close to the feeling of love is the only way I could make a relationship work. The only problem is, I have extremely limited skill in the artistic/athletic pursuits that seem to sufficiently entertain other ISFPs. I feel pretty stuck. My parents are extremely narcissistic and authoritarian so there's no way I'm going back home... \n\nAny suggestions? I really appreciate any thoughts.\n\nTLDR: Spent my high school and college years trying to force myself into a square hole for the sake of money. Forever relationship-less and unhappy, un-purposeful, I don't know the way out.
4	Getting over that for ISFP can be hard, I worked on myself for quite some time, just by getting into a lot of small social engagements to practice and develop communication. Just start by exploring and meeting people without any expectation of what it is to be. For example I work in a call center making minimal $, but I’ve learned a lot about what people are like, and for a big part of it, people are really similar. \n\nI think the biggest thing is just trying to understand what people are. Explore, notice patterns, you’ll start to see lots of similarities between people and you can start to feel solid about your communication skills. \n\nAlso observe that a lot of people are actually quite decent, I’ve had a lot of angry callers turn really friendly just by understanding their situation.  I mean, they were at the point of getting lawyers involved and literally yelling at the top of their lungs. Just so you know, I have a very low energy personality and don’t do very well in public speaking, but you’d be surprised how people change when you just work to understand them. You can figure it out, you can get there, just don’t try to be a personality, use yours and learn what people are like. That’s my experience from the last 10 years of traveling, teaching, and meeting people from many different backgrounds. People are really quite similar. Cheers!
2	I do enterprise programming for a living and I love it. Do not underestimate financial freedom.\n\nHave you tried tinder? After paying for professional pictures and taking advice form fiends I've had some luck there in rising my self-confidence.
1	hey man. just dont give up. Love is not forced. I cant help but tell you to try find God and live to love him but some how I dont think that is something you are open to. Spiritual wellness is an actual thing and I never want to force someone into religion, because that does not help them. Im also not saying become religious, Im talking about a relationship with God. Also try find a hobby that is different to your work, maybe more physical since you are a developer. Ill use something I did: I was feeling down and lonely after moving into a new place, I needed a table so instead of buying one, I made one. I love the look of wood so I went and got tools, asked advice and now ill keep this table till I die or it burns down or something. \nOn relationships: Oh boy. I know its not fun. some cliche but dont try and force it. this is where a hobby could be helpful. you can start something that has group classes etc. I know groups suck but with time that becomes easier. Love is not a job, it has to form naturally.\n\nBest of luck to you in this new part of your journey. Hope I could have helped in some way. Even if it is just to open your mind to something else.
1	Honestly, I know where you are coming from. I was in a very similar situation. I wanted to do graphic design but my strict mother wouldn’t let me. I was stuck studying something I didn’t really like. I worked really hard to keep my scholarship but everything felt so meaningless. I hated myself too. So I got into a relationship because the guy seemed nice. I wanted to feel good about myself. But you know what? Relationships take a lot of work. You have to be healthy yourself to have a healthy relationship or you and your partner will be miserable anyway. I’m doing much better now that I actually pursued something I like. I think you are right in figuring out that your career is the main thing to deal with right now. Because we depend mostly on Fi, and we have to feel like our work represents us somehow. Figure out your career first. It’s good you have financial independence. Remember you will still need it to figure out what to do with yourself and what you need to pursue. Don’t throw that financial stability away. Look at forums with people in industries you want to look into. Work on yourself first and the right person will come into your life.
1	Also, how do I approach shy guys like you? It’s so hard...
1	I don't think changing careers is a good move for you. You are trying to fix one issue by creating another! Emotional fulfillment from a job is an ideal, it is a lot to ask for. You are *so* lucky to feel financially independent at your young age. Start thinking about the future (hard for us ISFPs I know) and what you want from it and start saving your money to make it happen. You could save enough to 'retire' early if you put your mind to it and don't succumb to lifestyle inflation. By retire this could mean travel non-stop, actually retire and pursue charitable/familial endeavours/ go back to school or work as something that is very poorly paid and that you LOVE! check out /r/financialindependence for ideas. \n\nYou do not get fulfillment solely from relationships, if you were to enter one now I guarantee you would become codependent on them for your happiness and this would either drive them away or bring you into a toxic and unhealthy relationship. Think about your role models and the people you know who holds values that you admire. What do they do to gain fulfilment and inner peace? You need to build a life that makes you happy on your own before you should think about bringing someone else into it because a partner should be a happy little add-on or extension to your already good life. 'Good' life could mean anything to anyone. It could mean the cat you adopted as a kitten, it could mean spending time with your family and parents as they age, it could mean weekend yoga classes that help your mental state and get you fit, it could mean power-lifting or crocheting. Try to connect with others and be kind to yourself and them. \n\nLots of love. 
12	Do you consider yourself smart?	I have so much trouble expression all my thoughts verbally in a concise and understandable way. This sometimes make a me think I'm not that smart. 
15	I consider myself "smart" as long as I keep my mouth closed haha. The second I open my face, I cease to be able to say anything meaningful
2	Yeah. In a real unconventional way.
3	I feel smart. But then, who does not ? Is there anyone who doesn't think he's smarter than most, than common people ?\n\nI used to think about this sometime, but it's hard to find objective answer. You must also take into an account the fact that there are more types of intelligence.
1	Just wanted to say I feel the same way too sometimes. 
1	Smarter than others in some areas.. A lot of things I’m clueless on though 
1	I think I'm decently smart, I guess. I don't know for sure though, because at this point the only definition of smart I've been able to get has been force fed to me by the school system. \n\nI'm definitely not smart in social situations, lol. Either that or I think I'm less good at that stuff than I am. Same thing really. Pretty smart with logical things and creativity. Not so much with explaining what I'm thinking properly.\n\nIt's hit and miss for most people though, (unless you're like a prodigy at everything in which case good for you) some areas we're smart and some we aren't. The good news is it's possible to get better in all of them, it just takes practice.
1	Mediocre.
1	Not very, but it's not too bad anyway.
1	I think having trouble verbalising can be linked to many many other and various conclusions than 'not smartness'. Just sayin
1	I used to and still tend to think that I'm not really all that smart. And then I talk to my friends younger brother and his friends (about 22 years old, highschool dropouts) and they make me feel smart. I once used a work (i cant remember which one) that had multiple syllables and it blew their minds. They were like "you are so smart, what does that even mean?" The word was something along the lines of "hyperbole"  or something that is in most adults vocabularies. Its memories like these that make me think I might be smart. (despite having to try to spell syllable more than once to get it right)
1	Another response, more on topic to what you said. I have a hard time communicating my thoughts verbally to certain people (my boss or my fiancee) Unless it is something I feel like I am the "expert" on or something that I am really passionate about. It does make me feel somewhat not smart in a sense. Its a hard thing to overcome at times.
1	I am smart but I keep it to myself... perhaps because I lack the confidence in myself to express it correctly :/ 
1	I guess I consider myself above avg. If that makes sense. I have a university degree but I do not always express my thoughts well, dont think you need to be able to express your thoughts to be smart. Some people talk very well but share no actual information. \n\nThe people I work with think I'm an infinite source of information which is probably due to my family having this strange way of sharing any information acquired. So I have this very wide range of stuff I know bits about.\n\nBut then when I am around my friends from university I do not feel very smart as they studied Medicine and are now Dr where I'm but a mere physiotherapist.
1	SAME! i literally can't write. either i'm too lazy to think or i'm just dumb af
6	Do you prefer surrealism or realism in art?	I could see surrealism as being more intuitive and imaginative than realism. imo some abstract ideas can look so much cooler than just plain old realistic paintings
5	The look of most surreal art stresses me out to be honest, lol. It's not the fact that it's surreal, it's just most pieces have some air that I don't like. Though, I do love it a lot if it has a softer look, maybe with some bright colours. \n\nI like [this](http://www.cianellistudios.com/images/abstract-art/abstract-art-mother-earth.jpg) but not [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/The_Persistence_of_Memory.jpg).
3	I’m actually more into realism, unlike other commenters. Surrealism doesn’t always “make sense” to me. I value photo-realistic art pieces, the more skillfully executed - the better. Surrealistic pieces that feel “real” anyway are rare, but these are super cool too. 
2	I love both surrealism and realism, each for different reasons. Surrealism is the art of metaphor, one that can be unrealistic because it sets out to portray dreams and feelings in their most intensive raw forms, which I like a lot!\n\nI enjoy realism because it is the art of effectively portraying things as accurately as possible, every fine line helps to build up the composition as a whole to make it a meaningful labour of love.
1	[deleted]
1	Definitely surrealistic. More experimental 
1	I tend to dislike surrealism. As ThreeBlackSevens said, it stressed me out. It gives me that vague sense of nausea. I like abstract paintings though, so it doesn't necessarily has to be realistic. I also like impressionism for example. Still "real" subject but playing with colours to evoque different sensations and emotions. One of my favourite realist painters is Bouguereau which is able to make me "feel" the materialism of the bodies, touches and...let's say anatomy.
1	Surrealism
6	Banner for the sub?	Okay, I know I'm posting twice in three hours, but ay, why not. \n\nI think the blue thing is nice and all, but it doesn't really seem that ISFP, or particularly interesting. I have no idea how or who would actually go about implementing the banner, but I saw when the ESFP sub was choosing a banner they used this moodboard site. So I'm making a moodboard where anyone can go share pictures or whatever that they think would be a good banner. If you can't edit "ISFP" or something on to it, that's fine, just upload the image and someone else can, maybe. \n\nIf you're not submitting a final copy then full images are fine, or cropped to a banner size. I've seen 1920x150 recommended, but it's not necessary.\n\nI hope this actually goes somewhere! [Here's the link.](http://www.gomoodboard.com/boards/_0IswGmC/share)\n\nEDIT: in case anyone was wondering, to add a picture you click the blue "Edit Moodboard" button on the top left. It will tell you from there to add a file from your device or copy one in.
1	Is the moodboard not working or do people just not have pictures? :C
1	I don't know if anyone is still interested in this, but if I set up a google doc would people be willing to put their picture ideas in there? I can't figure out what's wrong with the moodboard.
5	Impulsivity gone wrong - Is this an ISFP thing?	So supposedly SP types, including ISFPs, are very impulsive in general. That's true in my experience, though depending on if this is really an ISFP thing it's not always in a good or even proactive way.\n\nI find that a lot of my impulsivity manifests, for lack of a better word, in laziness. I'll have a small part of a project as a daily goal, for example to complete a transition between two songs or something. But as soon as I start, I'll decide it's high time to go make some coffee or a pasta sauce, or maybe watch that Youtube video I just remembered. Useless stuff like that, that is fun for about ten minutes until I realise I just wasted all that time.\n\nAnd as for positive impulsivity, like calling a friend over or going on a walk... well, then my old friend overthinking (alter ego probably Fi-Ni loop) steps in and tells me to stay in the house. :\\n\nI guess the purpose of this post is twofold - to find if MBTI has any explanations for this and to help any other ISFPs who may have this issue feel less isolated, given the "go-getter actioney ISFP" tendency, or stereotype, or both, whichever it may be. Also random curiosity. :D\n\n(alsoimprocrastinatingrightnowmakingthispostactuallysupermeta)
2	Ill straight up wake up at 7 in the morning and decided im going on a 8 hour road trip to go see some waterfall without any prior planing. 
1	As an ISFP, I can confirm, we are quite vulnerable to impulse.\n\n(improcrastinatingaswell)
1	My impulsiveness is very hot and cold, sometimes I just do things and other times my overthinking keeps it under control. 
1	Wavpug summarized it so nicely!\n\nMy energy goes in spikes. That means that when I feel that rare inspiration to so something that is actually productive I have to surf the wave and try to do as much as possible. When I'm not inspired to do that thing I don't even lie to myself anymore. I don't even consider doing it.\nI think it has to do with our dom Fi. We constantly evaluate what is worth or not and, at least for me, I can do something when the "vibe" is right. Sometimes I don't feel it's the right moment to do that thing that I really like to do. Other times I have the urge to do that thing cause now it feels the perfect moment and if I don't I feel my mood gets down and I am unstatisfied.
1	This happens to me ALLLL the time. Doesn’t this have to do with my ADHD? I don’t fucking know.
1	Second and third paragraph describes me perfectly. Usually it takes me yelling at myself (out loud) and then explaining to myself why the past sauce can wait. Mixed results at best though.\n
2	ISFP/BPD?	What do you think? Could Borderline Personality Disorder and the ISFP type be related? What about ADHD? And anxiety? Or anything else? Thoughts?
3	[deleted]
3	I don’t think BPD is directly related to ISFP type. It’s probably like, certain types are more likely to develop BPD than other types, but from my understanding, BPD is more related to negative childhood experiences. \n\nAs for myself, it’s possible I have BPD. I don’t know for sure because I’ve never been told I have it, but twice I saw it written in my psychiatrists notes (which I only glanced at). I definitely relate to some of the symptoms. I also have anxiety. 
2	Well, I know that I have anxiety and bipolar disorder, but I don't think any mental illnesses are related to mbti.
2	I think mental disorders are more likely to influence type than the other way around. MBTI is just a system we've devised to categorise people, while mental disorders are actual, real, physical abnormalities in the brain. \n\nIf we were able to pinpoint the brain characteristics that caused type, then we might be able to determine a correlation and a reason for the correlation, but it still probably wouldn't be a cause.\n\nThat being said, there may be data about mental disorders and personality types somewhere, with statistics and whatnot.\n\nEDIT: [Found some](https://www.uccs.edu/Documents/dsegal/An-empirical-investigation-Jungs-types-and-PD-features-JPT-2.pdf).\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/a/02Nke) and [this](https://imgur.com/JTGbHH7) I believe come from the same study, but they're easier to read.
2	I've read somewhere that OCD is very common with ISFP. Checks out for me.
1	What do I think? I think you can't tie some personality disorder to an MBTI type. 
12	iSFPs and the romantic sublime	in english class, we learned about the concept of sublime in romantic literature and i think its something that would resonate with us (it probably resonates with everybody regardless of type but i feel like it’s especially amplified with us and i’ve attributed it to fi+se). it’s basically the feeling of awe and wonder that arises in the presence of natural beauty. romanticism is very fi because it entailed opposition to organised structures and strongly emphasised individuality. the romantic poets also believed that the emotional power of nature transcended rationality.\nanyway i fell in love with this idea because even looking at pictures of nature makes me feel a sense of calm i can’t quite describe. i get lost in the beauty of the world and the richness in colours. in these moments, thinking about meaning doesn’t come naturally to me. fi+se is not concerned with creating meaning but just experiencing and appreciating the full moment and seeing it as what it is and that’s okay. maybe there’s meaning in that - does something have to be profoundly meaningful in order for it to be valued?
4	Totally. When I'm in a place in nature that's extremely beautiful (which by my definition is practically everywhere, lol) I've sat there for hours just amazed at it. That's part of the reason I love canoe trips so much. Of course there's talking with the other people, but if you're canoeing for hours there are always long pauses where everyone is just paddling together and silently appreciating everything around you.\n\nAs for the whole meaning thing... Well, happiness can have meaning, can't it? I mean, we don't know what happens when you die, so if you lived a happy life, you felt like you mattered, and you helped other people do the same, then that's about all most of us can hope for. It follows then, that this romantic sublime, an extreme form of happiness, must be meaningful because it brings us closer to one of our key goals in life. Maybe it's not deep, because looking at nature doesn't tell you anything profound. But in my eyes, deep and meaningful are not the same thing.\n\nSo there's my inner philosophy hippie for the day. :P
3	This is why I love ISFPs, I wish I could really be there to let the beauty penetrate. :)
2	I get it. And it saddens me when people who don't get it pity me and think I'm naive and childish. Or that I don't have anything better to do than to be in awe at just what surrounds me. I think that being able to appreciate and being fascinated with life itself, is one of the most pure things to exist. I would say, for me, a humanist, contemplating and filling my eyes with nature and life it's the closest thing to spirituality.
1	For me, yeah. I don't really like art unless there's some kinda deeper meaning behind it, actually, scratch that, I like looking at art that's not "deep" but I never consider it a "masterpiece" or anything like that.
16	Does anyone do this while listening to certain songs?	When I listen to certain songs, both instrumental or lyrical, I tend to just sit back and let certain “scenes” like action sequences play out in my mind to the music; they usually range from sequences with fictional characters, original characters, or some strange amalgamation of both. To my fellow ISFPs, do any of you do the same thing and if so, what kind of music and what kind of “scenes” play out for you?
2	For me if it’s like the theme in Lord of the Rings, I imagine an epic journey, and when the tempo speeds up then the adventurers are getting into trouble and have to fight to get out alive
2	I do this exactly! Kind of Walter Mitty style stuff in my head to the music. Other times it will be like a shape floating in a void that changes as the music changes. 
2	There’s a song called “Sea” by pianist George Winston, and every time I hear it I either imagine a boat in a surging sea, or a chase scene. 
2	INFJ just strolling by. I have playlists of songs to which I have visually mapped out action sequences and short films.
15	Do you guys get crushes stupid easily too?	Basically any time I talk to someone of the opposite gender, 99% of the time I get a little crush on them. I usually struggle to be close friends with a guy unless I am not attract d to him in the slightest. I just think people in general are super cute once you get to know them.., are any of you like this?
8	No. I could count how many crushes I've had on one hand. But I would get "friend crushes", like I want to be someone's friend because they seem cool or whatever, but I'm always too nervous to say anything because social anxiety.
3	I would say lust instead of crush.
2	If you mean crushes as in small infatuations, then I absolutely develop those not only easily but often; I tend to notice little things about certain people that I like and it turns into a vague attraction, but it doesn’t usually last long. 
1	Ive never had one 
4	Share your art stuff tastes!	I read somewhere that ISFPs are often drawn to the weird when it comes to art. Like ugly, creepy, or just off things. So I was kind of curious what would happen if I started a thread about artistic tastes! It could be music, movies, visual art, writing... anything! It doesn't even have to be weird, I just wanted to say where I got the idea for this. Maybe it's your favourite piece, maybe it's one you think other ISFPs would like, or maybe you just feel like sharing a particular one now. Aaaand... go!
3	Some art pages I follow on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pigolin\nhttps://www.instagram.com/love.watts\nhttps://www.instagram.com/amidst.silence\nhttps://www.instagram.com/littlethunder\nhttps://www.instagram.com/artmadnessmag\nhttps://www.instagram.com/parallel_studio_
3	In all honesty, my art interests are all over the place. I unironically love the whole “Vaporwave” style (dare I say that it’s my “A E S T H E T I C?”), some retro 80s sci-fi style art, and pretty much things that incorporate dark purples and glowing objects.
2	I absolutely love Robert Rauschenberg's work! 
2	My favourite band is the Antlers by a large degree, I wonder if anyone else here likes them?
2	Jackson Pollock and Vincent van Gogh are my favourites.\n\nAnd of course John Squire.  
1	Oooooooi I love the modern art that looks like a bunch of trash throw. In a blender 
1	I may as well share some of my stuff here. Music is my life, so I'll stick with that.\n\nMephistopheles' Return - TSO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1H4TsKIjTc (metal)\n\nCalm Like A Bomb - RATM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbGJeXShopk (rap)\n\nImpartial - The Clockwork Dolls: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULzDJTo1zNw (steampunk[?])\n\nThe Count Of Tuscany - Dream Theater: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT8dNkD-Byc (progressive metal)\n\nInner Cell / Loyalty / Horology - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNGqG3BDtqo (psychadelic rock?)
1	umm well i studied art history, so i like a little bit of everything from classical to contemporary. if i had to choose though... Rococo. It never fails to brighten my mood 
1	I hoard pictures of art on both my phone, my computer, pinterest, etc. [Here's a tiny collection of ones I had laying around](https://imgur.com/a/7vTp1) 
1	The Beach Boys
3	Physical attraction	What do you find physically attractive? 
5	I like a guy with black or dark brown hair that is a little shaggy, brown or black eyes, and facial hair. A guy looks more laid-back when he doesn't cut his hair too punctually or shave too often, and I definitely need someone relaxed.\n\nI like it if his eyes crinkle or squint when he smiles/laughs. So sweet.\n\nFor some reason I am intrigued by tired-looking eyes, I think they hint at some kind of tortured soul that I could relate to :p\n\nI'm a girl with blonde hair, maybe that's why I find dark hair and eyes so magnetic.
3	It’s weird, none of the guys I like really look the same or have the same personality, but I definitely have a type, I just don’t know how to explain it. Usually I see someone’s eyes first- not like what color they are or whatever- but I swear one of the best feelings is when you look at a guy you think is attractive, and they’re already staring at you with this *look* and then they immediately look down or away. They look like lost puppies and I just want to go hug them lol. Also, HAIR! A guy could be pretty ugly in the facial region, but have nice hair and be super hot, it’s insane. For body stuff, it kind of varies. I don’t pay a whole lot of attention to height (because I’m fairly tall myself at 5’8” so a lot of guys are about the same height as me) but at the same time, it’s definitely a bonus when they’re taller than me, mostly because it makes me feel a little more feminine since I’m constantly taller than others. \nI also love when guys dress nicely. They don’t have to wear suits or anything like that daily, but even something like wearing their own kind of uniform (like a black or white T-shirt with jeans and vans or something) is really attractive, just because it makes it seem like they kind of have their life together lol. Basically, when they dress in their own way instead of just dressing to be trendy. This guy I know where’s pink shirts or black sweaters with floral print on the shoulders, and still manages to pull it off. Idk, there’s lots of little attractive things, and honestly, I could go on lol.
2	Smiles first, then eyes.
2	Physical appearance: Good looking face, hygienic, and tall. \n\nDemeanor: The ones that are subtly cool without really trying. More laid back and humorous. 
3	tits>ass
1	Eyes and hair. 
1	Face, fit (because i do exercise and i'm an active person, i couldn't be with a lazy partner)
1	chiseled face
8	It's difficult to have heartfelt conversations.	So I'm an ISTP, and my friend is ISFP. Occasionally we will complain to eachother about upsetting things, and usually we can relate pretty well. But the thing is... dominant Fi and Ti (ISFP and ISTP dominant functions respectively) paired with Se means that when we relate, we relate to similar experiences we ourselves have had or are having. The issue is... I'm not sure how to validate her feelings without turning the conversation towards myself. Like if she says school has been really stressful lately, obviously the way I relate would be to say I know what that's like because I have a lot of tough classes. But that just seems to have too many "I"s in it... I'm just not sure how to reply to a complaint, how do I show that I care without also being this guy?: "oh yeah I know what that's like, everyone goes through that, it's not that bad, blah blah blah."    Just saying "that's rough" seems like I don't care, and also goes without saying.
7	I don’t feel equipt to answer this but I don’t want to leave you hanging.\n\nSometimes I like to ask questions to encourage people to talk. Sometimes I share my own experience and ask a question to tie it back to the other person and allow them to have the last word so it doesn’t seem like i’m One upping them or always bringing the conversation back to me. \n\nFor example, she might say “school is stressful because the classes are hard” I might say “I understand. My classes are also stressful but I am lucky to have a reasonable prof. Do your profs help make the course load easier?” \n\nThis example is a very rigid and shallow exchange and irl it usually flows a lot better. I can’t imagine a conversation between the two of you and this is the best I could come up with without any background info. In real life, I’m only half as awkward as I seem online and this approach usually works for me. \n\nI hope this helps! Best of luck to you! \n\nEdit: an after thought-\nBecause she is Fi dominant, she may have already appraised the education system and you could try to get on the same level as her values. For example, you could say “school is stressful. I hate how they force you to compete against each other by marking on a curve. I find this encourages me to sacrifice authentic learning and take a more ‘learn to test’ approach. Would t it be great if we were marked against ourselves and not otherS?” \n\nYou might want to have a pretty good idea of what her values are on a particular subject before going this way. You could ask her what she thinks though to find out. As an ISFP, I’m always thinking about things and what they result in and how they could be improved pr the negative effects could be mitigated. I also love talking about that shit. Maybe she does too.
5	Sometimes all someone needs is for someone to listen and understand. It can feel a bit obvious or repetitive to you, but questions and simple reactions to what she's saying can go a long way. Even saying something like, "I'm sorry, that sounds hard." can mean a lot more to her than you think it does. Especially if you follow it up with questions about her situation. Even if it feels like the question has no practical/constructive purpose, just listening and letting her talk could be highly therapeutic for her. Saying you relate to her isn't a bad thing, as long as it isn't minimizing her experience or implying you know *exactly* what she's going through. Just let her do most of the talking. :) If you can think of a person or a time when someone helped you feel better, taking inspiration from that could be helpful.\n\nThis definitely goes for anyone, not just Feelers. And I'm not qualified either, lol, this is just my experience. Good luck! :D
1	I agree with both comments so far. Reaction, asking questions and also specific answers to what she’s saying go a long way. I find it difficult to open up to people who don’t actually react to what I’ve said, and just answer with their own story. I like it when the other person asks me questions and is engaged in what I’m saying. They don’t necessarily have to agree with me, but if they ask me questions it shows me they genuinely care what’s bothering me or just what I have to say in general. By asking her questions she will feel like she’s being listened to, as well as giving her a safe place to vent without feeling like she’s being judged, and the conversation with flow. You will find she will like to ask you questions too.
4	ISFPs, are you good with verbal communication? What can make you feel at ease in voicing your thoughts?	
9	I've been told I should do improv because of how weird some of the stuff I say is... Like I can visualize what I want to say in my head but I can't quite get it out there. I feel more at ease voicing my thoughts if I'm clearly engaging the person I'm talking to (like if they are reacting as I'm speaking). 
8	Depends on my mood. One moment I’m great at talking and then I’m not. If I’m not communicating great is because I’m uncomfortable for some reason.
5	For me, it I've learned it really depends on my confidence levels. Which I can't really figure out. Sometimes I'm more confident, and other times I have no confidence at all. It seems like there is a somewhat strong correlation with the environment I am in. But sometimes I'll be with my closest friends, and have 0 confidence in my ability to communicate something. And the more I think about it, the harder it then becomes! Maybe it's an issue of me overthinking it. Overall when I am confident, I communicate much more clearly. And when I am not as confident, everything comes out all scattered and its really hard to get my point across, no matter how much I have prepared or have thought about what I am going to say.
5	Pretty bad unless I'm on a rant. Jimi Hendrix (also an ISFP) was apparently really bad at expressing himself in interviews.
3	I need to get in "the zone". If someone asks me something immediately I might have problems voicing my thoughts, but If it's me who wants to talk then I get in a comfortable flow. That's probably because when I want to talk then I already have the conversation "prepared" or my thoughts grouped.\n\nI also have problems with holding a "small talk" type of conversation, because I prefer to speak when I really have something of value to say, I keep most of my thoughts to myself.
3	i think so, i pretty much just vomit out all of my thoughts in a stream of consciousness sort of way
1	Im decent with verbal communication it depends on who I'm talking to and how much I trust that person with my feelings. It also depends on how much I understand my emotions, if I really trust someone and I can tell theyre listening to me I have no issue with talking about my emotions, opinions, etc 
1	Like everyone here says, it depends on the person. If it’s someone I don’t know, I usually narrow my communication to single sentences without giving information about myself. If it’s around people I know, I’m usually not scared to speak my mind.
1	I'm okay with my friends. But with family or at work I'm awful. I'm doing assertiveness training right now but I feel like I'm taking 2 steps forward and 1&1/2 steps back all the time 😅 Because I'm so bad at it, I try prepping what I'm going to say in my head, but it never comes out sounding like it did in my head 😅 With friends it's no problem usually. 
1	I guess I am to an extent. Talking with aquaintances are a breeze but also brief. Usually it involves only questions or convos about school stuff or work unless they share personal stuff, which I find that other people share to me a lot. To friends I'm starting to learn how to not hold myself back. Talking feelings out usually doesn't settle well with me though. Nothing else can make me feel at ease when voicing my thoughts until I've decided I want to let them out.
4	Just ISFP Things...	Are there any things you do or recognize and attribute to your type? \n\nI think it could be fun if we shared some of our ‘just ISFP things’ and maybe we can see how closely we relate to each other’s experiences.
18	So I don't know about others but...I tend to wander. If I'm with friends I tend to find myself detached and off on my own adventure.\nSometimes I don't realize I've wandered off until I look around. \nBut I always find my way back to my people. \nBut this could be even on my own. I'll go out and float around and see what happens 
12	I’ll start!\n\nWhen you’re in a museum and your considering considering the ethical implications of having artifacts that are only there as a result of an abusive colonial relationship and you find yourself dragging your fingertips across the glass cases and stanchions wishing you could touch these unethically displayed items. #justISFPthings\n\n(I’m assuming this relates to our Fi and Se functions. I feel bad that there is still such global inequality as a result of colonialism and that it’s normalized by having things that were stolen from a nation that was terrorized by colonial powers displayed for public speculation without drawing attention to the implications it has, but also I really wanna touch all the stuff.)
10	You might want to give this a try, https://imgur.com/a/qBlBf\n\nSorry for the lazy post :|
9	I like having conversations in my head with everyone I see. I would build these back-stories of complete strangers, wondering why they did what they did it.
2	Sometimes I just kinda zone out and have like complete storylines in my head and I have no idea where they came from...
13	Getting self-conscious around strangers	Hi, I'm a 21 years old ISFP and I sometimes feel kind of self-conscious around unknown people while doing stuff like eating or studying etc.\n\nIs it common in our personality type? If it is does it go away when you grow up?\n\nFun fact: I even got self-conscious while writing this post and edited it about 4 times before finally posting.
14	It’s common for ISFP, it’s basically because we have a high internal awareness (strong feelings) and then we try guess the perspective of what others might think or feel. It makes us feel nervous/anxious when we can’t really guess what others are thinking. It’s why you re-wrote the post 4 times. 
0	idk are you a woman. They are usally higher in neuroticism 
4	Oh... Am I an ISFP now?	Hello! \nI'm new here. My entire life I always considered myself an INFP and I'm still fairly split between INFP/ISFP. I just wanted to get some outside input on this and see if anyone has a similar situation. \n\nAfter my first semester of college as a design major, I realized that while my roommate (also a design major and ENFP) was always focused on finding and explaining deep meanings in her work I just wanted my work to speak for itself and be what it is. \n\nI've always had this part of my brain in school that wants to find the real world application for everything I'm learning otherwise I tend to tune out and not take it seriously. \nI enjoy extreme downhill skiing- especially moguls and tree runs because you only have to focus on the next thing in front of you and not the entire mountain. I also really love challenging acting roles in theater and have always been known as a great "in the moment" actor. I'm impulsive and not very money savvy and I often feel the need to go out and explore by myself. \n\nBUT I do consider myself an idealist and overthink situations that have happened/are happening/will happen and I'm not very good at remembering small details. Because of this, on online personality tests, I tend to score more N than S. \n\nI'm torn between the two! Anyone else?
5	I'm in a very similar situation, I don't really know which one I am.\n\nOne thing I'd note is that overthinking situations isn't necessarily an INFP thing. It depends on how you overthink them.\n\nDo you see/hear something and then think of all the negative things that could happen? Are there a lot of "this bad thing could happen, or this one, or this one...?"\n\nOr do you obsess over one possible negative outcome until you convince yourself that it's probably, and eventually possibly certain? "When they said that they probably meant x bad thing, which makes sense considering y and they gave me a dirty look earlier"\n\nThe first one is more Ne, which would point to INFP, and the second more Ni, which would point to ISFP.\n\nYou sound quite Se to me, but a lot of INFPs like outdoorsy activity and a lot of ISFPs don't, so that's a little difficult. Honestly the Ne/Ni/Se/Si functions are what I have the hardest time with for anyone, tbh.\n\nKeep in mind, most online tests are slightly biased towards E and N results. 
3	TL;DR When someone mentions how amazing it was something in the past and how much they would love to live in that period, and you roll your eyes, then, probably, you don't have Si in the stack. If you're the one that prefers to live in the past, then you could be an INFP.\n\nLong version:\nA difference I found often is how we go about past experiences and favourite things.\nFor me, once an event or a relationship ended, it's done. It stays in the past. No thinking about it (specially in a melancholic way), no trying to go back to it. I recognize it was an important and emotional moment maybe, but i wouldn't want to re-live it, nor actually going back in time. It was beautiful, I liked it, but the present and future are way better. INFPs usually tend to indulge in those past moment, idealize it and dreaming of going back to those moments, considering them better than the present they are living.\n\nWhen I have a favourite thing (or just something I really like), such as movies, songs, places, restaurants etc... I appreciate them and they hold a place in my, uh...top lists?, but I still prefer to watch new movies, go to new places, try new restaurants etc... INFPs tend, instead, to go back to those comforting movies, places...\n\nFor what I understand, the presence of Si in the stack makes it so that Si users feel soothed by a known object or feeling, therefore they prefer to re-create those moments.\n\nAs an example my ex-bf (which I'm not sure the type but imo he had Si) always wanted to watch movies in the evening, and wanted to re-watch for the 96367th time the same movie. When going out, he suggested to go for the 35049th time to the same restaurant 'cause he liked it and he knew what to order. I felt bored and caged by the lack of change.\n\nThe other things that you mention seem shareable by different types for different reasons. For your test results, don't take them too seriously and consider also your enneagram which can give you a particular flavor.
4	Sad songs	I was just watching iceskating and one of the competitors was skating to music from Dr. Zhivago, and I remembered how when I was younger and that used to be my favorite movie and it made me cry back then. Kind of giggled about that. Then ON CUE when the song started playing tears came up to my eyes and i couldn't believe it, I had to stop putting on my makeup because the Dr. Zhivago theme was still making me cry even today. Is this normal? Do you have a song that gets to you? Not necessarily crying (I'm a cry monster) but that tugs at you? 
4	Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd and No Surprises by Radiohead both have that kind of effect on me
3	Trasatlanticism by Death Cab \nI think because I feel like it relates to a lot of my relationships. Gets me every time. 
2	It doesn't make me cry, but both Soldier Side and Roulette by System Of A Down really get me every time. Soldier Side actually did make me cry a little once. I generally don't listen to sad songs though. The closest thing to a "sad song" band I listen to would be Syd Matters or Automatic Loveletter, but even them i wouldn't call sad. Except maybe Black Ink Revenge by AL.
2	Gus Black's "Autumn Days"
2	I'm INFP, and naturally, lots of songs. I'm a big cry monster.
2	Chet Baker - The Thrill is gone, Almost blue... Alain Peters - Rest'la maloya
17	This is ridiculous.	https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/7m5z3j/comment/drs28h1\nThis comment and its replies are some of the most disgusting things I have ever read. 
10	> I thiiiiiiiiink one of my exes was an ISFP. He tests as an INFP but there's nothing going on imagination-wise and he hated deep or philosophical conversations because they upset him.\n\n10/10 MBTI typing skills there.
7	ENTPs weakest functions are our opposites— Fi and Se. So, you’re right. They tend to stereotype too much before knowing people. They label people they don’t really like as a certain type they THINK they wouldn’t like. They rely more on what they already think they know than what they can see. And they might let ONE bad experience color their entire perception of a type. So don’t let it get to you. Obviously they don’t know you. They’re just ranting. 
6	Gotta love those sweeping generalizations,  right? 
3	I mean some of the comments were already pretty outrageous but I lost it at we're not spiritual and we're some of the most materialistic types... what? I mean sure SOME of ISFPs can be materialistic (and sometimes it's not even a bad thing), but I sure as hell am more spiritual. (I mean, just because I don't like hypotheticals and talking endlessly about concepts doesn't mean I'm not spiritual) Don't know where they get those conclusions from. \n\nENTPs sure like analyzing others' behaviors but they don't really like analyzing their own, do they?
4	I mean I feel the same way about ENxPs. Fuckheads annoy the fucking shit out of me.
2	The irony is that by getting offended by the thread you're only proving their points about ISFPs being overly emotional.
3	I'm an INTJ female currently dating an ISFP male for 5+ years and it's ridiculous to generalize like this. Some things are not dependent on personality types and are a habit, which can be learned and unlearned. 
1	What a bunch of horseshit. The NT types on Reddit are a joke
9	Faces of isfp?	R/infp does a selfie thread every several months but ive never seen r/isfp do one. I know we're small but.. Idk could be fun, right? Post your selfies here yall.

2	You are all so cute🙌
1	Yeah make this, I want to get some data to prove that 70% of you females have dyed hair. I know that you all consider it dyeing your hair. Im I wrong or not? :D 
1	You all have similar lips 🤔😂
2	Are you jealous or possessive in a relationship? Why yes or why not? Thank you!	
6	I don't consider myself jealous, unless there's reasonable suspicions. In that case I'd inquire and demand honesty. I trust the person I'm with and if they abuse it and cheat, then they're just not the person I want to be with anyway. I give people frew will to make their choices, but to own and be responsible for them. I want the person I'm with to be themselves, to have hobbies, friends, an unstressful life, to be happy. \nI've been on the other side and I know just how much it weighs when the person you're with irrationally wonders and doubts about every move or decision you make. I myself want to feel free to meet my friends, my colleagues, family, without having to be anxious, without worrying that my S.O will get mad at me. They have to make me feel safe, not caged.\nMy partner is my safe haven. He has my back. He understands me and nurtures my growth and happiness. A relationship is made of trust and respect and I expect it as much as I give it.
5	[deleted]
3	Jealous? Yes, a little too much at times. I think it might stem partially from some underlying trust issues and insecurities. :/\n\nPossessive? Not really.
1	Not really :P sometimes i get a little jealous but  my boyfriend thinks its cute. I kinda like when he gets a bit jealous too >.<
6	Are you friends/good terms with your ex? Why yes or why not?	
6	Not really. I usually idealize too much, and when bubble pops, it's a nightmare to cope with them.
6	My most recent relationship ended on good terms but we aren’t really friends anymore. I think it’s because we don’t have much in common. At first it kind of bothered me but now I don’t really mind
1	No, because I don't have one.
1	Yes, because both of us realized that we weren’t going to go anywhere together. She is a fun person to talk to, but our paths just weren’t meant to merge together for very long. 
1	I'm in good terms with only one of my exes and because that was the only time when we split by common decision. Every other time I was the one breaking up and I had no reason to be their friends. I just close that chapter and move on.
1	No because the break up was too hard so we decided itd be best to cease contact and eventually we both got into new relationships. I messaged him one time a year after we broke up to gauge his interest in a friendship and got no response. Its best this way. We're both happy with our S/Os now so it all worked out :) are we friends? No. on good terms? Yes In the sense that we wish each other well.\n\nMy other highschool ex and i like eachothers stuff on instagram and ive seen him around town a few times and been friendly. So we are like passive social media friends. Hes pretty chill.
1	No
1	When my ex broke up with me, we stayed in contact for about another year before naturally ceasing conversation. Same happened with this one girl I tried dating, we didn’t last a month but it was enough time for me to get emotionally invested. I don’t really regret breaking off contact with both, letting go after giving my heart away is not something I can do easily (I’m still having a hard time dealing with having my heart broken by both of them today).
6	What are isfps actualy like?	It seems to be a trend that a lot of internet articles say isfps are bubbly??? But I thought you guys were a bit more laid back, kind of shy almost. I have seen some articles support the one stereotype and some support the other...
19	I would never describe myself as bubbly, I am in fact more laid back and quiet. I’m not really shy, I was as a kid, but now I’m just quiet as I prefer to observe conversations than add. I’m more of a listener than a talker is what I’m trying to say. Sometimes I don’t say anything because I have no idea what to say. \n
15	Naturally I'm a mix of both, it just depends on my surroundings. If I'm alone or in a really comfortable place I'm very chill and mellow but if something really excites me or I'm just in a really good mood I can be really bubbly and energetic.
10	We're all bum ass bitches 
3	I don’t feel ISFPs are bubbly. More like seething. It’s the ESFPs who are bubbly.
3	Same here. More quiet and laid back though i get really bubbly when excited and really feisty on occasions.
3	Shy and quiet with people I haven't connected with. \nBubbly when I know and like people enough to be silly with them.
2	I wouldn't really say I'm bubbly. Around people I don't know or like very much, I'm pretty withdrawn and/or tense. Around people I'm moderately okay with or close friends in a calm mood, I'm pretty laid back. The only time I might be described as bubbly is when I'm with friends and we're not just chilling or something, but then it's more like hyper than "bubbly." Think loud, obnoxious, making jokes (mostly puns tbh) every 5 seconds, etc.\n\n\nEDIT: some phrasing.
1	I am definitely bubbly around friends I am comfortable with. Otherwise I am shy and laid back. 
8	Productivity problem while on "self employment"	Hi ISFPs!\n\nI have problem with my productivity. I recently quit my job, to start my own business. I quit it on December. It means that since January 1 I am unemployed. I didn't start process of creating business because I thought that I will create product first, then handle formalities. The problem is I can't make myself do it. Every day I watch a lot of tv shows and movies. I first two weeks of January it felt good, because I was so overworked in last year or more in witch I had only few days off. But recently my internal compass is telling me that I should start doing something. But I'm still looking for distractions and not doing actual stuff. Recently I feel like I lie to myself.\n\nHow do You manage Your productivity? How to escape trap I have put myself into?
4	Seems to be a common problem for ISFP. So many times I've had my big plan of all the cool things I would do using my skills, but in the moment I'm always just sleepy and unmotivated. In school I frequently turned in essays overdue and incomplete. \n\nI need an employer to keep me accountable, that might be the route for you too. Or at least build your business in spare time before making it your full time gig.
2	Hi\n\nI have a similar problem since I was a teen. But slowly it makes me sick because I can't manage to do anything for a longer period. I always get distracted by anything that entertains me.\nBut slowly it starts change. Because I know I always try to lie to myself e.g. that I'll just watch this one episode and end up watching three I wrote my daily goals on a piece of paper in table form.\nAnd at the end of everyday I make a cross for every goal I didn't manage to finish and a checkmark for every goal I successfully finished. This process makes me always aware when and where I failed and I feel bad about it and have more motivation to change that.\n\nTo clarify your goal seems important to me and when you realize that you feel like you are wasting your time do something about that in that moment.\n(Too many "you"s in that sentence ^^)\nAt least I try to do so for myself and I have to say its getting better :)
10	Do a lot of iSFPs mistype as INFP?	For a while I mistyped as INFP, and I was wondering if this is a common thing. I've heard that ISFPs are some of the least obviously sensing S types. Plus, if the inferior Ni is well developed, it can lead to a lot of Ne-seeming actions. I know the main reason I mistyped as INFP was because I saw the "mental disorganisedness" that is frequently attributed to Ne, until I looked into the tertiary Ni vs Si trait. \n\nNot to mention I like a lot of philosophy, but even then I prefer it when some sort of final conclusion is reached, rather than just brain-spitting a bunch of possibilities. I see that as Ni rather than Ne, but as you may have noticed by now I'm not really an expert on functions, lol. \n\nSo yeah: the title is really the main thing. If you have, then how and why do you think you mistyped?
7	Same here! I always get either ISFP or INFP and to this day I'm not sure about what I truly am 
5	Yah every time I take the test just to see an update in me it's usually a 51/49% split between S and N.
7	I tested as INFP up until I was about 21. I thought my "head in the clouds" nature, love of school, and my tendency to be "out of touch" with my surroundings meant I was an intuitive. \n\nThen I met a real INFP and understood the difference.  
2	I usually get infp but compared to my extremely infp sister i am quite clearly isfp. Its hard to explain i guess but i can just tell that im more of an isfp. I think isfp can often identify with infp descriptions because the true differences are deeper and more complicated than "infps like philosophy and are imaginative emotional artists" etc etc.a lot of the surface level infp traits are very relatable to isfps too.
1	i usually test as ENTx, being extoverted and thinking is a lot more relatable than introvert or feeling.

3	been friends with an isfp for a while and now I've got feelings for her	As the title states. I'm a male, she very clearly sees me as a guy friend at this time, we've been just friends while we were both with different people. She's been single for a while, and recently I've become so as well. Thing is, someone who used to be good friends with me, and I, met her at the same time, we both wanted to make a move but he told me about it first so I respected it and let him, they were together for a short while but they're just good friends for a while now even though throughout that friendship he told her he loves her several times, he is dear to her but just as a friend. This person and I are no longer friends, I took him out of my life because of just how arrogant and I inconsiderate he was, but now he is still good friends with her, more than I am, and I am friends with her but now I feel like I wanna be more than that. What do you guys think of the situation? What do you think I should do? Is there a way to let her know of my intentions that wouldn't rock her entire world? Would she even be willing, considering this friend of hers?
3	Speaking as an isfp female, well... U deserve chance to confess ur feelings to her, but its her choice whether to accept u or not. Try doing activities with her (physical activities, maybe)  which she enjoys doing, so u guys can get closer. 
6	Nerds	What do you think about nerdy/dorky people? I'm ISTP I think, but I act a bit more like xNTP due to social anxiety... do you find people who can talk about random knowledge for days annoying? It's hard to tell when y'all just stand there listening and then just say "cool"...
2	I’m the nerdiest nerd 
1	Usually I’m just observing how you guys act more than listening to what you’re saying (somewhat judgmental....can’t help it) 
1	Im considered nerd/dork by many people. I dont see why it is linked to certain personality types. I enjoy knowledge. Not always, yes I have to be in the mood for it. So it really depends on many factors and not just personality type. But I will say I do just say "cool" when discussing things sometimes, but thats because I would rather avoid confrontations and not because its about things above my 'nerdiness'. 
1	I think most people get a little bored with a one-sided conversation, where one person is talking about their interests or personal life for days and the other person doesn't have anything to contribute. It all depends on whether your interests are interesting to them, and that varies by the individual (not just mbti). \n\nBut nerdy/dorky isn't necessarily bad, I love hanging out with nerds because they're not afraid to be different, and it helps me be my weird self.\n\nCould be helpful to try to engage the other person more, pay attention to them and find out what they're interested in (not in a stalker way though). Although many ISFP don't want to talk much even about their own interests. Sometimes I greatly prefer to let other people talk, it's much easier for me. But if I'm interested, I'll usually say more than just "Cool."
1	I’m a huge nerd/dork (I’m reminded often), and it all depends on the subject. Talking about computers and tv shows I can go in for days, but talk about cars, politics or sports, I’m lost. I don’t know what to say in those situations. Sometimes it is interesting learning something new, but since I don’t have any more background knowledge, I can’t talk much about it. \n\nAnd also when someone is talking a lot, I find it hard to interject my own thoughts or say I’m not interested because I don’t want to seem rude by interrupting them
10	I think you mean ISFP and not ISTP?	
5	No, the ISFP subreddit is for talking specifically about the ISTP MBTI type with very little discussion about any other MBTI type /s
3	Keen eye, I must say
2	Long time, and only You noticed. You are not one of us!

7	A closer look at iSFP	
1	shit i just realized i wrote iSFP and not ISFP 3 months later 
3	Differences/Similarities to INFJ	Hey there, ISFPs.  \n\nIt’s recently come to light for me that along with INFP, ISFP seem to be another common mistype that follow along in INFJ descriptions (likely due to this “intuitive bias” that can be seen around the community sometimes).  \n\nI wonder, in what ways do you think yourself similar to INFJ?  In what important ways are you different?  How do you tend to see this intuitive bias?\n\nThanks in advance!
6	Hello and welcome! (And thanks for asking!) \n\nI'm aware that there are some feelers that tend to mistype as INFJs quite often... I haven't typed myself as an INFJ, nor do I want to. I actually like being an ISFP, I just hate how our type is perceived by the MBTI community. I've recently seen a post (on Facebook) that describes ISFPs as being "the black horse of MBTI". I think it makes sense, honestly. We have dominant Fi (which everyone hates), and then we have PoLR Ne (which basically equals to us not being able to see multiple perspectives, in intuitives' eyes. which isn't true). If I expressed myself and my MBTI views, I feel like no one would believe me, just because how ingrained certain biases are in the community. \n\nThat said, INFJ is apparently quite a popular type in the community... but I just can't see it for myself. To me INFJs just seem like more intuitive ISFJs, or more feely INTJs. That means, they can be plotting but also quite conscious of their image in the eyes of others. I'm not like that. (Quite honestly, I can see through it.) \n\nI'm similar to INFJs in the way that I may act nice and friendly when you first meet me but I am actually quite detached. I can relate to being a perfectionist (somewhat) and feeling socially isolated. I consider myself quite spiritual and can have some obsessions with metaphysical things... I like and appreciate beauty (well, I'm an ISFP, lol). I can space out quite a lot, too. I have a hard time making friends but good at keeping them, I guess. I can relate to "knowing things" out of nowhere. I usually require a lot of alone time. \n\nI don't absorb others' emotions easily, nor do I plan much. I'm less codependent and other people-focused. I don't struggle with physical things. I'm more "present". I'm not comfortable with giving emotional support/advice to people by talking. I'm more supportive by pointing out facts. I usually like to have an identity that I hold on to (for better or worse) and can have strong opinions. I like to do spontaneous things. I'm sensitive but I'm not good at showing my emotions outwardly.
2	We are both introverts. We both tend to like the same things, but for different reasons. For example, my husband and I are both Trekkies, but I like Star Trek because of the analogies and political relationships between the races, but he likes it for the space ships :) We are both artists, and to be frank, he’s a real artist, and I’m an impostor. ie: it comes naturally to him, and for me, it’s like pulling out teeth. We are both nice to people, but I really like people, and he doesn’t. I’m more extroverted than he is, even though we both need our space to recharge from social interaction. He’s sportier than I am. I’m not sporty at all. We’re both lazy, but just because he’s an Se user, he eventually gets more things done than me, in his own haphazard way. I’m the leader in the relationship. I almost always have a clear idea about where to go, what to do, what to eat -and he’s happy to go along with it. I like to tell Dad jokes, but he’s good at mimicking impressions from movie characters and stuff. I suck at it. And he hates Dad jokes.\n\nBut I suppose the biggest difference between us, is that I don’t mind doing things because I have to. I’ll do something I hate, just because it’s my duty -but for him, that’s a huge turnoff. He’ll probably do it if he has no other choice, but it bothers him a lot more than it does me. As for me, I feel proud of myself, because I ‘did the right thing.’\n\nHe can never get his head around that one :)
5	What do ISFPs love doing?	
8	I love snowboarding, photographing, skiing, hiking, snowmobiling, watching tv-series/movies, playing CS:GO and stuff
4	I like working out, lonely walks, video games, math, computers, science, philosophy and spicy food (don't tell anyone)
3	My ISFP friend loves making art— painting, drawing, sketching, knitting, crocheting, and sewing.\nShe also loves animals— she makes friends with everyone's pets and she adores horse back riding.\nShe enjoys photograghy— pictures with her phone and pictures with her camera. Pictures, pictures, pictures.\nShe loves tv and movies. She will watch anything that isn't scary or dirty. Because she is an ISFP so she is a cinnamon roll.\n\n
3	I love art. Drawing, coloring, painting. I love fashion and choosing outfits, doing makeup. Photography is really fun. Decorating my home. I love watching movies. I love learning about subjects I’m interesting in.
3	i like doing activities outside (skiing, swimming, etc.). listening to music, taking care of animals, taking pictures, home decor stuff, watching tv shows 
2	I prefer to do things that require a performance (doing exercise, going down a trail with my bike, playing a game physically preferably) anyways i also like to watch films and i'm starting to read, maybe i'll get the habit.
2	Playing chess. Reading. Learning physics. Watching lectures and documentaries. Programming. Weightlifting. Arguing with people. 
2	I’m an isfp female (married, Mom of 2, mid 20s)\nLong walks alone\nHiking\nListening to audiobooks\nAquarium, museums, and Amusement parks (in that order)\nCOOKING (my form of artistic expression)\nCrafts\nDIY home improvements \nWorking in yard/garden
2	Drawing, any sort of exercise(preferably with only one person or alone), video games, practicing an instrument, listening to music, and making things look nice (organizing my room)
2	Sudoku <3 \nand watching movies with my boyfriend on the couch with a big fluffy blanket
2	Not sure if I'm ISFP or ESFP. One of those. Probably. \n\nI bounce from activity to activity a lot depending on the day, how I feel, rain, sun, stuff like that. I have the most fun with solo sports, freestyle skateboarding is probably my favorite followed by surfing. I would surf more but it's far to get to any beach. \n\nI like backpacking a lot. It's a bit expensive for me for long thru hikes but I try to take a month or two a year to do something. \n\nFor lazier days, I'll just hit a coffee shop, read up on a subject I'm into, go on Reddit, practice piano, take a slow hike, apply for cool jobs I'll never get, play a game, fall asleep at a park. I also love film photography and I'll take a camera most places I go. It's something I can sink a ton of time into. \n\nWhen hanging with friends, we will generally go to a bar, music show, screw around playing golf, board games. I have a lot of hobbies and I always find more and try new things but never stick long enough to get really good at any. It sucks but also keeps things fun\n
2	Well mostly i love lying in my bed doing nothing while i listen to music. But i also love to draw, write in my journal, sing, write songs, play guitar and ukulele, plan outfits, play with make up, cook, play games here and there, watch movies and tv, try out restaurants i havent been to, read graphic novels, watch lets plays. In warm weather i like to go on bike rides on my beautiful red bike or walk my dog. Ooh and also have solo picnics under the shade of a tree-sometimes i bring a bubble machine because it really adds to the atmosphere.
1	Watching an unending stream o tv shows and movies.
1	i love drawing, sleeping, watching tv, watching youtube, playing the piano, singing, dancing, coloring, playing with my dog, painting,  windowshopping/shopping, playing video games. i used to love cooking and yoga but i don't have the patience most days anymore. i also love golfing but i don't go much because it's expensive for me right now. im not really into photography but if im in a big city i like to go to the top of some building and take beautiful cityscape photos. 
1	I usually just spend my whole day on the internet and sleeping, but when I'm not a lazy mess I like to travel, ski/snowboard, ice skate, play volleyball, do gymnastics stuff, go on boat trips, do something fun with friends, play video games, take pictures, swim..
7	How worried are you about losing your sanity?	I’m just going leave this here... 
7	Yes. Probably Thursday. 
4	It’s already pretty well gone. 
3	none? I dont really worry about things.
1	I'm scared and worried, yes, because i have been depressed with self harm episodes (not very bad luckily) and i'm scared to do something that makes me fall there again. I'm scared to the point i avoid situations where i can fail, approaching a girl because of rejection, bad grades on exams (i can't avoid exams so when i have finals i get anxious and stressed), i guess i have to live with it,
1	I never believe the thoughts in my head if there is any emotion involved, since I know my feelings change dramatically from day to day. I never know what to expect from myself.
2	How to tell the difference between ISFP and ESFP.	So I’ve taken the test about 3 times in my life(currently 22) and the first time I got ISFP and the last 2 times I’ve gotten ESFP. I like to be outgoing and be excited and enjoying peoples company. And then sometimes I just want to go home or barely stay at a party because I just get tired and drained of people. Which isn’t the way for an ESFP. Do I don’t know if anyone else has felt this way also? Because I really do enjoy entertaining people and making them laugh. Sorry if I seem so scattered with my thoughts.
4	To me it sounds like you’re ISFP, because I am similar when it comes to being social. I enjoy being around my friends and talking to them, but once the group becomes bigger than ~5 people (including me), I start feeling drained.\n\nIt’s also possible that you are closer to the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, causing you to feel both ways. You may want to read up more on ISFP and ESFP to see which one you relate to better to aid you in deciding which one you are. 
2	It’s all about your cognitive functions. I would probably guess you’re more of an ISFP as you’re describing feeling tired and drained from parties and people at times. ISFP also lead with Fi, which is different from the ESFP leading with Se. 
1	Cognitive Functions 
10	I am normally calm but when I get angry I am obsessively so. Is it just me or an ISFP trait?	I am normally understanding. I rarely get angry. But when my personal limit is hit, I get extremely angry. Especially when I had to spend too much time with an unpleasant person. I wanna lash out and rant, but I get sorta frustrated and I get physical like kicking a door or slamming my fist on the desk. Are some of you like me or do I need therapy?
7	I have no emotional regulation so I either feel no emotion or 100 emotion
1	I think it really depends on how often you are getting angry like that. I'd say I've only been above my "personal limit" like twice in my 25 years. But I can relate to a certain extent. 
1	How expressive are you of your displeasure generally? I find when I bottle up my anger or dismiss annoyances because they're "not a big deal", I can get pretty ragey over random things. It's like, trying to out a lid on the anger only to have it spill over everywhere else.\n\nI really don't like when I get like this, because I often end up lashing out at people who have nothing to do with whatever I'm angry about. Even if it sounds dumb, talking about it while it's still a small issue helps to diffuse. If there's no one who'll listen, just saying "I'm so <optional expletive> mad" out loud is better than nothing.
1	I get like that sometimes too. If you want to work on it, look up Distress Tolerance, Mindfulness or DBT therapy. All three of those helped me let emotions go easier so that I wouldn't get so worked up.
1	I totally get you. I am just so calm always that friends tell me they can't even imagine me perturbed. I sometimes am creepily calm in situations. But when I lose my temper, I LOSE IT. Love venting by breaking things that are disposable, punching the wall, screaming into pillows etc. This is partly because I don't want people to see this side of me. 
1	you may need therapy, but its all mental, so somewhere along the line youv been hurt and cannot cope correcty?
3	What do you think about ISFJs?	How well do you get along, friendship-wise or relationship-wise, what do you think about them in general?
2	My best friend of 15 years is isfj. Shes the best! Very witty and smart, caring, goofy, fun, responsible, compassionate. The only problems we had while living together for 2 years was she used to sneak into my room while i slept to throw out my beer bottles and collect dirty dishes. I didnt want her to but it just bothered her that much that they were there. Also she hated that i never closed the kitchen cabinets. But we get along amazingly and always have fun. I love that ginger cutie pie.
1	My dad is an ISFJ. He's one the most selfless people I know. He works long hours and comes home and still does stuff around the house. Family is everything to him. He doesn't say much, he lets his actions speak for him. He's always on the move. If there's nothing for him to do I swear he'll still find something that needs to be done. He doesn't ask for much, either. Give him a grill and he's happy lol. I seriously hope I'm half the man he is some day.\n\nCoincidently, I also now have an ISFJ roommate. I see the similarities between him and my dad. Constantly staying busy. Not much of a talker. He's very relationship dependent, though, always needing someone to be there. Perhaps he needs to be doing something for someone else, like fulfilling a sense of duty? He does have a bit of an ego, though. And quite temperament. We clashed in the beginning, but we've adjusted. When I first met him he came across as very selfish. But the more you get to know him you start to notice that selflessness thats in there, which I think he tries to hide. Maybe because he's still young and a little insecure? He's good people, though. I know if I had an emergency and called him he would do all he can. 
1	Not super relevant... But at the suggestion of my friend I've been looking into it more and I think I'm actually an ISFJ, instead of ISFP... Still trying to figure it out though
5	Is she into me? ISFP female	So, i called a friend into a room together with me and asked her advice in a situation I was in. This then escalated into a 5 hour discussion where she started talking about her personal life including a few awkward things she went through, books we both read and then music we both listen to. I also put some of my personal life out there and responded as she went abouts with each topic. \n\nI've been quite good friends with her for a while, had our ups and downs but we both work in a group of 8 people. We're all quite good friends but because  of the group setting its hard to read her.
2	id say try to get to hang out with her one on one a couple more times and see how things go and if its any different. she obviously seems comfortable around you so i dont think shed decline. but i wouldnt base any final conclusions off this one instance, you make it sound like this is the first time youve interacted with her at this level.  \nbasically try building the relationship up a bit more and then youll most likely know how she feels by then. and even if youre still not sure, at that point itll be ok to reach out and ask her if shes into the idea of you two. i know from experience that Fi doms really want to know a person before making up their minds about them.
1	Could be, but not necessarily. I'm certain she feels comfortable with you and also likes to spend time with you. Did she show any sign of being into you besides that? Discussions can escalate really easily with me and a friend. Specially when it's 1 or 2 people at most, which doesn't mean I'm interested in them.
1	There's really not enough information to say. She definitely seems to be comfortable with you, but I have no idea beyond that.
4	how isfp behaves during stress? does he use logic? what to do with isfp?	so..? 
6	How people react to stress is different for everyone, I know some isfps that can handle stress pretty well, and I know some that do not handle it well at all. Me personally, when I get stressed I tend to shut down and want to avoid everything. Something to help someone in my case would be to provide assistance if possible and be very open, kind, and understanding of the situation that caused the stress to come on in the first place. Keeping the peace is definitely a key thing to remember. 
3	When I’m during stress I feel like I start loosing it. I become very anxious and I have to work really hard to try to contain all of the stress and and anxiety and even then I feel like people know I’m going through a rough time. Usually some time alone to gather my thoughts and come up with some sort of strategy to solve the problem puts me more at ease and gives me hope to do what I have to do
1	It depends on the setting. The best way I can describe myself being stressed out is through analogy. At work, I’m like the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Quiet, focused, intense, and bordering on cold toward everyone I’m around; my logical side also does tend to surface at work where I start planning out my next task while completing a different task. At home, I’m more like a river: my emotions flow a little better as I don’t feel the need to dam up my emotions in front of people. My logical side doesn’t really surface as much at home for whatever reason I can’t seem to figure out myself.\n\nI’m probably not speaking for all ISFPs, but I usually just handle my stress and my problems by myself; however, it does become more manageable knowing I have someone who can help me if I get overwhelmed. If you have an ISFP coworker/friend that’s stressed out, just let them know you’re there for them if they need help. Believe me, it’s incredibly comforting knowing somebody has my back. 
10	You guys! GUYS	You are so damn cute! Just saying.
4	:3
3	No u <3
1	why? what's your type?
1	Ya got me
12	Can't decide on a career path	Hey everyone, \n\nSo a little bit about me. I'm 27 years old. I am an EMT out in southern California. I previously worked for a mortgage bank for 5 years. Near the end of my time at the bank I began to lose interest in my work because of how little growth I was experiencing. \n\nWorking as an Emt is nice. I get to interact with people during their time of need, however it's not a very financially viable option for a long term career. Despite how fulfilling it is, I'm constantly thinking about what I want to do in the future. \n\nMy question to you all is, how did you all find your careers? Did you stumble upon them, or did you know exactly what you wanted to do and pursued it?
4	I tried different things (some of which i liked) that i used as a base knowledge and to understand what i was better at, and then went for something that allows me to keep exploring new skills and learn new things so that not only i can grow inside my profession, but i can change career if the situation called for it. Maybe this is not my final job but i'll get all i can from it.
3	My girlfriend an ISFP struggles as well, don't worry. She first went to college for electrical engineering, decided she didn't care for that, flirted with a minor in programming, also decided it wasn't quite for her, settled with a degree in accounting for its practicality (at the least, should easily find a job even if she doesn't enjoy it) and because she didn't want to keep switching majors. All the meanwhile, she had jobs at fast food, in construction, on an assembly line under a microscope making medical parts, and at Mernards, finally now working as an accountant...for now. As far as hobbies goes, she likes crafting things, sometimes drawing or painting, but typically crochet, duct tape, and sometimes wood projects. She sorta plays with the idea of starting an Etsy shop, if only she could consistently make stuff. Just an aside, but I value her handiness compared to me, she does most house projects. I'm just pointing that out to say that you can offer value in many things just by acquiring skills from odd jobs. \n\nI don't think you guys are suited for traditional "careers" in the sense that you'd be fixed in a certain realm doing more or less the same things, just with different titles attached. Just my opinion, I believe you'll be happiest simply applying yourself to wherever your present interests are without necessarily worrying about the future. Once something stops being interesting, move on to whatever else currently fancies you. At worst, hopefully you find yourselves a more traditional "stable" partner that'll keep you afloat as you transition. 
2	My husband is an isfp, and a nurse. Was a medic in military first, then phlebotomist, then nursing. He’s also been a bouncer at times through school. 
2	I just took what I enjoyed. I am a Physiotherapist, and I got to that by knowing I like biology, I found human anatomy and physiology very interesting. Then I also like helping people. So I looked at all tge careers with these and physiotherapy was a good fit. On that note I also love making food and thought about chef, so I started doing that a lot and I started enjoying it less so I realised I dont want to kill that joy by making it a job. I think for me it has to be something I enjoy and that has a reward in people, getting rid of pain or increasing someones function is a great reward. Unless money is what gives you a sense of accomplishment then dont try look at how much you will make, first look at what will inspire you to actually work everyday. Good luck. Dont rush it. You will find the right career. 
1	What is your desire? 
1	I'm actually currently struggling with the exact same thing as you.\n\nMy entire life, from as young as I can remember, my answer to, "what do you want to be when you grow up?", was always the same: Veterinarian (which eventually changed to Veterinarian Technician when I found out what that was.)\n\nI then found myself with an amazing opportunity when I was 18 to be trained hands-on as a Vet Tech, while getting paid to do so. It was a crazy dream come true at the time, I couldn't believe I had achieved my life's goal straight out of high school.\n\nThen I realized I was actually quite depressed, and I didn't have the passionate I thought I would as a Vet Tech. \n\nWhile working as a technician, I continued to work a second job at the restaurant where I've been working since I was 16(I'm now 20). I quit the clinic and went to work full time at the restaurant, which I'm still currently doing.\n\nThe pay is decent, I get good hours, and the people I work with are my family. I'm content with this right now, but I'm also becoming restless and feel like I need to start figuring out what I want to do long term. Which is a terrifying thought for me because I don't even know where to start.\n\nGood luck OP, I truly hope that you can figure out what makes you happy and gives you a fulfilling life.
1	Have you ever looked into becoming a physician assistant?\nIts a two year masters degree program, you essentially see patients one on one like a provider would, but can’t be employed independently without an MD.\nPA programs require patient contact experience to be admitted, and you’d be able to use your EMT hours towards that. Just a thought:)
11	Why is it so hard to get to know you guys???	You all seem like such amazing interesting people. but none of the ones I know seem to show any interest in speaking, they give short concise replies when you address them directly. If you don't address them directly, they don't care. Ok this they I'm talking about is one person... and I really like her... and I don't know why I like her because it's not like I even know her very well... and I'm Fe inferior so I'm just floundering and wondering what to do next... what are some ways to get you all talking??
5	aw <3 i cant speak for all isfps but i'm quite shy especially around people i don't know well and when in a group setting, i feel like i don't have anything interesting or relevant to contribute to the conversation so i don't really speak unless spoken to - but i can assure that we are listening. as for how to get her talking, find something you have in common so it's not like you're talking about something you don't care about, we love to connect and can tell when people are just talking for the sake of it ahah.\nsince you're istp, our se-ni means that we're sorta on the same wavelength! and sometimes you don't even need to talk to get to know someone, to an extent, obviously. i find that sharing music can somewhat tell a bit about a person. anyway, good luck with her!
5	Find out what she's interested in, probe with open questions, perhaps try to lead her on to talk about some examples (we love examples).
5	I prefer actions instead of talking.
3	Male ISFP here, \nI don’t tend to talk a lot but if you find one of my interests where I feel like I have something to share (they tend to be intense, for me it’s cars, technical things, public health, problem solving, photography and etc.) then I will open up and talk more. I also need to feel safe when talking so it can take a while even if I like you to open up. But if I feel that I can trust you, that we have a shared interest (I’m very conscious of the fact that what I’m talking about may be boring or annoying to you. Probably because it can happen in reverse to me (personal example is sports) and that you actually want to talk to me or get to know me then I will open up and want to reciprocate. \n\nAlso give her time to respond, I tend to need to think before I speak especially with new people. \n\nThat said I’m also totally clueless to people liking me so for me being a little straightforward and telling me that you like me would probably help, although even that might go over my head. \n\nThat said everyone is different even if they have the same Myers Briggs type.\n\nEdit: I may have missed the main question. I am hard to get to know because I’m scared of interaction. I fear getting hurt and don’t feel that anyone could like me so I assume they have no interest or that they just want something from me. It takes a while to get past this and for me to see that it’s genuine or doesn’t have a negative motive. That said I’ve also been emotionally abused and neglected my whole life by my family so it might be different for other ISFPs.
2	Are you addressing them one on one or in a group? What's your mbti?
2	Sounds a lot like what i do :/ for me its because im not a great conversationalist combined with some social anxiety. I dont add to conversation unless im addressed directly because a lot of times im not sure if im welcome in the conversation or i am nervous to assert myself without invitation. \n\nI give short answers because i dont know how to further conversations well. If i dont have an opinion on something i find it hard to find things to say. \n\nI am best at interacting with people i have known a long time and not that good at feeling comfortable with new people so while im friendly with most it is rare that i actually make a new friend.\n\nIt may not seem like it but she could have some subtle social anxiety that isnt apparent to others. making it SEEM like shes aloof or doesnt care. \n\nA problem for me is that i like a lot of people and want to be friends with them but i cant ever manage to get there.
1	How about walking her home? That’s how my ISFP got to know me :)
1	Idk, I only talk when I'm comfortable. Usually with my circle of friends. Maybe it isn't even you, it's just the ambient.
1	I’m an ENFP and my boyfriend is an ISFP. \nWhen first getting to know him I was basically pulling teeth! He was hardcore the hardest person to get to give you any type of information about himself. He is extremely shy, so I of course, made it a personal mission to get to know him. He noticed and slowly let me get to know him because I truly made an effort to do so and he appreciated that.\n\nThe fact that we worked together helped a lot on my behalf because he was basically trapped in a building with me for 5+ hours a few times a week so he inevitably had to give in. \n\nNow here we are three years later and he talks around me nonstop. It is still a little difficult to get him to verbally express his feelings, but I think that’s just his nature bc ISFP’s express more with physical gestures/actions than verbal ones. \n\nBut if she’s anything like my precious and wonderful ISFP I would say stay persistent because they are totally worth it!! \n\nAs far as things you can do to get to know her, \nget her one on one and ask her about something she likes, or get her to explain something to you. My isfp loves explaining his interests to me (he is extremely techy and I am not). This will help her open up and be more willing to talk to you in the future. Keep approaching her and talking, but with different subjects and you will find out a lot. \nMy ISFP doesn’t like talking in group settings unless it’s amongst his closest friends. I noticed while getting him to open up to me that I basically have to probe open-ended questions to keep conversation. 
1	I require help identifying my friend	I suspect he is an ISFP, and he refuses to take the quiz, so i typed him based on readings and functions (FiSeNiTe) The problem is that I am not seeing his Fi very much. I am wondering if you could donate some aid to finding him out. some traits are\n\nComes up with excuses to not go out to play a game with me\n\nprefers video games to any other option (and is very good at it).\n\ngets migraines A LOT (don't think this will help)\n\nattacks you when you poke him too much.\n\ngets angry when you don't believe him when he is lying.\n\n\n\nhope you can find it out! thanks in advance!
2	even refusing to take the quiz could be a Fi thing :p About the lying, is there a particular reason why he does that? Though he already does seem like an ISFP from the traits described.
1	How old is he?
8	Feelings	Lately I've been vocal about my feelings. I've caught myself complaining about nothing and perhaps it's the holidays getting to me, but I found it unusual. Anyone else can relate?
3	I do this too. Just that time of year. If I wasn't single I wouldnt be so sad sometimes but that's just life\n
2	Those aren't feelings, those are emotions. Feelings are always tied to an object, emotions are more of a mood, which may lead you to complain about nothing.\n\nEveryone can relate to being in a bad mood, even if they may not want to. Schedule a day with a friend, it can help in amazing ways.
9	silent as the grave?	Do you guys talk less then most people? And when you do are you sarcastic at all? If yes/no What are some reasons why? Thanks!
11	Yes.\nMore fun to be a dick in my head \nOr on Reddit \nHuehue 
10	I’m extremely quiet around people I’m not close with and or people I would rather not be surrounded. Why? Idk I’ve always been a shy/reserved type of person. If a isfp is really talkative around a person, it usually means they really like them
3	I talk too much. And I ask a lot of questions to deflect my talking too much
6	I'm usually the most quiet person in the room who only talks with smart one liners. 
1	I'm quiet around people I don't trust. I don't expect my feelings will be respected, so I won't share them. Around friends I'm pretty loud though.\n\nI'm not a fan of sarcastic humour because it often strikes me as mean-spirited. Realistically it probably isn't, a lot of the time. It's just whenever I get the urge to make a sarcastic comment, it's always at someone else's expense. So that's probably coloured my perception of sarcasm in general.
1	Yes, also I’m sometimes sarcastic but I’m trying to stop being sarcastic at all because I think it’s mean. I don’t talk a lot unless I know and trust you and think I have something worth adding to the conversation. I don’t like speaking just for the sake of speaking and try to think carefully before engaging. I also fear getting hurt and speaking is an opportunity for that to happen so I’m quite reserved unless I trust that person. 
9	eNTJ female dating an ISFP male - do's and dont's	Hello there. \nI'm an ENTJ female in my late 20s and I've been dating an ISFP guy for 2 months. \nDoes anyone have any experience with ENTJs? Any advice? :) 
9	My boyfriend is an ENTJ and I’m an ISFP!!! :) I love that he tells me straight up how he feels about me. I overthink and worry so him being direct is so reassuring. It wasn’t until I got to know him better that I saw how ENTJs are so picky with who they spend time with lol! That made me feel pretty special that he let me into his circle, since he could have a MILLION friends if he wanted to, he’s so confident! Likewise I enjoy my alone time, so me wanting to spend time with him means alot too :) I was soooo afraid my huge daily dose of emotions would have him running, but he says he loves them x) He loves making plans and decisions, and I love just going with the flow (aka be lazy) so we’re a good team!! Good luck! :)
7	ISFP female. For some strange reason, ENTJs feel very safe to me, like I can count on them to have my back and to put me at ease. I feel like they like to show me things, and I love being shown things. They like to dissect my value system in a way that makes me easily open up. I haven't been in any intimate relationships with them though.
3	ENTJs like efficiency, order, ambition.  Gifts they'd like are pragmatic, like a cordless vacuum, a sharp chef knife, a USB lighter if they're into candles for relaxation. They like cleanliness and productivity. \n\nIf you don't take offense easily, you're in the healthy range NTs need. 
1	AAH. I have no advice, sorry, but seeing these budding relationship posts makes me want to meet an ENTJ already, pick their craniums apart, compare individual similarities/ differences and compatibility for friending. So.. where can I buy one of y'all?
4	I need your help	My friend is isfb and I don't know how to help him. She always says that she can't recognize her own feelings. And often she says that she doesn't feels loved and is not good enough to be in a relationship. I don't know why does she feels this way? She is loved by many people and she doesn't have major depression. How can I help her recognize her feelings better in a healthy way? And make her feel loved? She knows that I love her and her parents and other friends but she still feels this way and I'm worried and sad that she feels this way.
7	As much as you may want to, you can't fix her. I don't know if this is all isfp's, but I have to deal with my feelings and emotions on my own terms. No one can do that for me, and no one can force me to do so. I have to want to. Sometimes I process by journaling, or talking to myself or screaming in my car or by talking to someone I love and trust and getting everything out in the open until it all makes sense. I like to bottle things in for a while until the pressure gets to be too much and I just explode. Releasing the pressure so that it's not all so internal and up in my head helps a great deal.\nBut basically, just be there for her. If you want to help her, show her that you're there and you're not going to leave. Sometimes there are no right words or actions. Sometimes the best thing and the only thing you can do is to be there and to be present. As simple as that seems, it helps, at least for me it does.
1	How do you know she doesn’t have depression? I’m not saying she does but only a qualified professional can make that claim. I have the same thoughts but I have depression and have been emotionally abused and neglected my family for most of my life. I see a therapist every week which helps but I also had to recognize what was happening and want to get help and then find it on my own. If she does want help you might be able to help her see a therapist by offering to drive her there or something but she has to want it too. 
3	The Silent Treatment	I'm kind of looking for a second opinion on something, in case I was overlooking something.\n\nI had a crush on a girl for a while, who I'm pretty sure is an ISFP. She knew about it, but she starting dating someone else. I'm okay with being friends instead, especially if it meant we could talk - but she never says anything back. I try to write supportive comments on her art posts online, yet she always leaves me hanging. She doesn't block me either, even though there wouldn't be any consequences. I don't know if she's mad at me, if it's just awkward, or if she's worried that her boyfriend might feel hurt or jealous if she talked to me. I don't really want to confront her about it as if I'm entitled to be her friend... and really I shouldn't have to. \n\nWhen I try to talk to her, one one level I'm checking to see if she's ready to be friends. But on another, I'm worried that she's sacrificing a lot of time and energy to make the other relationships in her life work, but no one's really checking to see if she's doing okay. It's kind of like there's a mask there and she's not really putting herself out there like she once did. It's almost like she's putting off dealing with the things that are really bothering her. I'm not really sure what to do about that, especially since it's not really my place to point it out to her. 
6	I'm guessing she wants to make it clear to you that she's in a relationship, and she probably doesn't want to cause drama in her relationship by talking to you. Maybe once she is more secure in her relationship she'll feel ready to talk to you again. Or on the other hand she's feeling annoyed and wondering when you'll get the hint. \n\nI'd pull back and give her some space. Let her come to you, if she wants to. If not, let her be. 
2	Don't mean to sound harsh OP, but have you considered the fact that she may be a bit creeped out by you? You sound heavily invested in someone who is dating someone else and doesn't/has barely spoken to you.\n\nMaybe I interpreted your post incorrectly, but it sounds like you had been crushing on a girl that didn't really acknowledge your existence, and now she is dating someone else and still not acknowledging you...perhaps this is a sign that she is not interested in any sort of relationship with you, friendship or otherwise?\n\nHad you both been close friends and then she stopped speaking to you once dating her boyfriend, one could say that either she was respecting her boyfriend by not talking to guys that she knows have a thing for her, or that she was simply dedicating all her time to her new boyfriend. \n\nBut the fact you have said that you have 'commented on her posts online' tells me that you are most likely not close to her, or else you would have at least seen her in person or even have her number to message her!\n\nYou have stated what you want from her but have you considered that she has to want the same thing for it to be possible? Her not wanting to be your girlfriend, or even your friend, doesnt have to be because her boyfriend or someone else isn't letting her. Maybe she isn't interested in you, friend.
1	I've thought about it some more, and I've come to the conclusion that not saying anything is really putting off a decision. It's just kicking the can down the road, and that could still get her in trouble with her boyfriend if it seems like she's trying to "keep her options open." Really, she probably should have said something to me a long time ago - and then we could have talked. I knew she wasn't interested in dating, but it was weird and conspicuous that she couldn't seem to say anything at all. I really don't think her boyfriend has any idea about all this, or else it would have put pressure on her to say something already. \n\nA long time ago, I figured that even if I had been right in thinking that we were potentially compatible -- the right types -- that doesn't necessarily mean that we would end up with each other specifically. But now I'm getting the sense that's she's just not ready in general. It seems like there's things she's not telling her boyfriend that he should know about, because they are relevant to their relationship.
5	What is your main role on MOBAs?	I was just wondering if ISFPs have a predominent main role.
5	Probably not.
3	Solo offlane
3	League of legends - Played adc/support for years, jungler now with highest rank of plat 1 but I’m trash now that I have a more regular job. 
3	Support role, mostly 
3	I am mostly the healer or support
2	Passing INTP here- \n\nWhat little LoL I did play, I usually preffered to play defensively as a mid-lane mage, like Annie. \n\nIn Overwatch -- if you count that as close enough to a MOBA -- I often end up playing a tank, like D.Va, Orisa, or Roadhog. I think intuition helps to read the situation and know if you need hold a strategic choke point until back-up arrives, or if you should fall back. Sometimes keeping the enemy from getting dug-in at a good spot is more important than finishing off kills. 
2	i played LoL and would play adc/support mostly but if not that, i played top lane
2	So mostly botlane from your comments ? Not many comments so it's hard to tell
2	When I played LoL I mained top, the only fun role for me.
1	I started as Support roles, but now I tend to play offlane (LoL jungler) and ADC's the most. 
7	How do you motivate yourself?	I'm always only motivated from externalities, it's really tough doing anything in my life. 
5	Find inspiration and feel a dreadful feeling of inadequacy, become angry and then that motives me
2	I think about the consequences of my neglect and disinterest.I am extremely adept at this because I always imagine the worse possible thing that can happen thus propelling myself into deep fear and paranoia. There comes my motivation.\n\nThough externatilies also motivate me well enough.
2	how can i engadge my se?	im an infp its hard for me to consiously engadge my se i get drained realy quick,what fun things can i do but at the same time realy have to use se?,i was thinking of looking at art pictures,because you realy forced to pay attension to the details? but what els,other wise,im always using ne
3	Trekking :) 
3	Being outside in nature, putting on music and dancing, creating art
2	Ski snowboard snowmobile hiking photography 
2	Martial arts or combat sports. You'll learn to recognise and react to external cues quickly, as well as understand your own body better!
4	Is there such a thing as "too independent" when one is in a relationship with an ISFP?	
4	I’m an ISFP, and I’ve done this to my SO. It’s mostly because I don’t want to burden them with all of my contemplation and struggling with stuff, but I can see how it might come off as being distant too. I hope it’s the same for you. 
1	[deleted]
3	What is the best approach (reaction)from a person when their ISFP friend/partner withdraws for a couple months?	What i mean by withdraws is he barely says anything, interacts a lot less, and when he does say something it is something very ....random, compared to his usual self. How long can it last?
1	Withdraws for months? Is that a thing ISFPs do (I genuinely don't know, I'm just bouncing around MBTI subs killing time)? That's sounding more like depression than anything type related. \n\nMight he be trying to end the relationship but isn't able to just come right out and say it's over? You deserve an explanation. I can see a bad week, but a bad couple months? Why not just ask if he's doing ok at this point? It seems like you've given him plenty of time.
7	ISFPs, do you usually let someone (friend, spouse, partner) know that you like/appreciate them? How do you express it and affectionate emotions in general?	
7	I believe one of our traits is showing appreciation through thoughtful actions and gifts, rather than stating it to them
6	I can give hugs and kisses when i meet someone, but it's just routinary, i do it because it is what you do when you meet with relatives or friends. If i have to show affection, like real, it is very hard to say "i love you", no matter it is my mom, best friend or partner, i have no idea why, but for me it's so hard to say 3 words.
5	I am definitely not a verbal person in this area, unless it's after a long night and I'm a little bit drunk. I just started seeing a guy and realised that I like to buy really inexpensive, meaningful, playful gifts. For example, while getting groceries, he asked me to get him a single apple. I asked what type and he said 'surprise me', so I bought him 5 different apples - partly because i found it funny and mainly because it was too much pressure to choose 
2	I do thoughtful little things for them to make their lives easier. I rarely explicitly state that I appreciate them and if I do it comes out a little unnaturally. If that person is affectionate with me I am really affectionate back to show appreciation, but if not I just do little nice random things for them. 
2	I usually tease them jokingly, and sometimes get carried away with it. You’ll also know how much I love and appreciate you, if I’m willing to talk to you more than most people, and stay close to you through thick and thin. Also, I’ll try to go out of my way to compromise, help out, and make you feel at ease, if I genuinely care about you when you ask for help, and sometimes even do nice things for you without anything to gain from you at all because I genuinely care about you. 
1	I think everyone is different. Have you looked into that book "The Five Lanuages of Love" by Gary Chapman? It may help you find your answer.
1	I'll tease them, and, yes, I can go too far sometimes. But I'm super affectionate with my close people. My daughter, for example. \n\n
1	Hmm... I say it in a very straightforward manner. Like, if I wanted to show my appreciation for someone I block all of the hesitance away and let my thoughts speak. Straightforward meaning no segues. I rarely do it anyway and there are only a number of people I hold on a high regard so fuck it right? I would go out of my way to help them too, and offer support when needed.
6	What Type Were You Prior And Why?	For a long time I used to test and type myself as an ISTP. I think I misconstrued some of the questions or definitions I read online thus developing false notions of my mental process. Like, I used to think the value driven aspect of my character "was" principle based, or its entirely possible I just felt a lot of descriptions made feeler types sound mentally deficient. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nAny others encounter a similar problem or just have a story to tell?\nWhat defining moment made you consider otherwise on your type?\n\nThank You,
3	A few years ago when I first discovered MBTI I got INTJ in a quiz and thought I was INTJ, then I thought I was another type (not sure which one), then I found out the quizzes were bad and checked the cognitive functions, and typed myself as ISFP.
3	A year ago I got Intp in a quiz and some of my friends too. But now we all did the same quiz again and we got all different types now. I got Isfp and also checked the functions and I have to admit that it fits really well.
6	She told me she hasn't shown me the "real her" yet...	So I know this girl, and we've been talking for a while. We're just friends, but I think she likes me. Anyway, she recently told me she hasn't shown me "the real her" yer, which was like throwing a giant piece of cheese at me, lol. I don't know if she did that on purpose or what.\n\nI read that the ISFP type can be reticent to show their real selves to others.\n\nSo, ISFPs, particularly women, how/what does it generally take to get you to open up more?\n\nIf you're curious, I'm an ESTJ. Not sure if ISFPs and ESTJs are a good mix. Relationship type stuff seems very opposite as for as stereotypes go. ESTJs are very loyal, a little but more "safe" and reliable, while ISFPs are described as being slightly more flighty/fun types. Haha, no offense anybody--they're just stereotypes anyway.\n\nI'd love some input, though! : )\n\nBy the way, I'm 29 and she's 28, so we're not like teenagers or anything going ga ga all over each other.
6	to open up i usually have to know you for a good while and feel that the other person and i have a deep and strong connection. when that happens, the person is definitely very special to me. \n\nedit: i'm surprised she admitted that though, i think it's a good sign that she's honest about that :)
5	You have to be accepted into the circle of trust. \n\nWith me the best way to do that is to somewhat be stubborn about contacting me and showing yourself to be a "a safe person." It takes a while. \n\n\n
3	I can relate. We seek deep connections with people, she might not feel that with you (might no ever, just because of Fi)
7	Looking for ISFPs to take my short survey on accomplishments and social media. (Takes no more than 5 minutes) Many thanks from an ENFJ!	
4	Secret Santa Gift Help	I (not isfp) am doing a secret Santa, and I'm buying a gift for my isfp friend. She's 24, in medical school, wants to travel, and loves TV. Any ideas?
3	Netflix/Hulu gift card
1	Isfp in medical school? Neat! I’d love to hear her experience.
6	ISFP-ISFP break up	I am an ISFP myself. \n\nMy ISFP Gf of 16months last week said no to hanging out, which she never does without an explanation and said she wanted to call me, which she doesn't usually do. I knew something is up and she will prob break it off. She has been acting distant and looked in grief for the last 2 weeks. \n\nShe eventually called and said that she can't see me anymore. I didn't know what to say, didn't want to seem needy and said ok. She asked if that's all I have to say. I said yes and then we said bye.\n\nSometimes I think she wanted me to talk to her about what was the problem. We are both isfps and bad with verbal communication so I think this wasn't the healthiest way.\n\nWe were close to each other and showed alot of care. It was the first long term relationship for both of us. \n\nPopular advice is to cut all contact and forget about her and start getting taking care of yourself and move on. But I sometimes think things could have ended differently. \n\nI know we were getting bored of each other as identical personalities would, but I don't feel like this is the best way to deal with it. 
4	Use your words. \n\nYa'll have been together 16 months and your response seems more in line with someone telling you they're not gonna make it to the annual christmas party this year. Just based off this you seem slightly indifferent about it?? \n\nBeing your first relationship, you should talk to her when you have your emotions sorted and find out "her side of the story". (assuming it didn't end with cheating or something nefarious). Take the bits you feel are relevant and try to "learn" from it. 
3	When she says if thats all you have to say, she is asking a response from you. I guess she wants to talk about something
1	Yeah, I definitely recommend gently approaching her/texting and asking her for an opportunity to talk with her and ask her what's up. I'd also try to somehow make it apparent that she doesn't have to speak about it if she isn't comfortable--maybe offer to do something she finds relaxing with her so she can sort of "unload"? She certainly seems to be holding stuff back. Hang in there!
4	How close are you to your family?	
3	Not even a little. I am a middle child. I'm closest to my older sister, but even then we never talk. maybe once every few months. My younger brother has a similar personality as I do (almost a mini-me) so we don't have much to talk about either because we just shrug our shoulders at each other and say "I dunno"
3	I'm pretty close to my family, but I don't feel tied down to my home town. In fact I live 2000 miles away from all of my immediate family and its fine. I still feel close to them and i still see them for holidays and talk to my parents and grandparents often. My brother and sister in law are even thinking about visiting me. 
3	I always make sure to talk to my family on special occasions such as birthdays, holidays etc. I never forget to send presents or cards, but I think over time this has become a thing I do to compensate for the fact that I don’t visit often. I moved out of my family home when I went to uni and I never came back. I’ve always wanted to be closer to my family but I have always had an underlying feeling that my family never “got” me, so I never fully felt myself around them. Now that I’m living on my own, I get to be myself around people that I feel understand me, so over time I’ve become more distant. 
1	Sometimes I talk to my brother and sister. I’m no contact with my crazy mom. And about once a year I talk to my dad. So, not very close at all. 
6	INFP dating an ISFP	Hi!\nI asked for help with this topic among my other INFPs and didn’t get a lot of response. Any input, advice, or experience regarding this thread would be really helpful!\nI’m a female INFP with a mild crush on an ISFP male. I’m afraid I’m not interesting enough for him to talk to, because everytime I’m around him I get instantly shy. I have no trouble extroverting and being friendly with people in our circle of friends but I just don’t know what to say to him to get him talking. He’s an incredibly talented musician and totally eccentric as a person, which I find endearing rather than off-putting. However as I can only make minimal conversation he just, well kinda stands there and listens and waits for me to talk, and I just awkwardly stumble over myself, even thougg we are both humorous and extremely intelligent people. \nI think he’s interested; he does walk up to me and be friendly and such, but I’m not for sure. His best friend is an ISFJ and thinks we’d get on delightfully well and that it would be a good match. But since we both share the feeling preference, most Likely....INFPS tend to be like “No, you cant date them, it would be too emotional/chaotic/a hassle and you’re always taking care of them bc they’re like inept children”. \nI really need to hear things from your guys’ end bc the Infps are being a bit...depressing and whiny honestly. \nSorry for the long post. I think it would work because Im a little more on the logical side of the INFP spectrum.  Help!
4	Well before you take anything I have to say seriously I've never been in a romantic relationship, the extent of my knowledge here is how I behave around my crush, who is probably INFP.\n\nI know oftentimes I will just listen to people talk because I find what they have to say interesting honestly. The causes vary though, around my crush... well I don't talk to her much because I am afraid I'll look stupid, lol. \n\nIf you have an interest in music, I would suggest striking up a conversation about music if you want to get him talking more. If he's like me, then a mention of his interests is enough to get him talking enough that he may have to remember to let you get a word in edgewise! XD\n\nI wouldn't take the people on the INFP forum talking about how INFP and ISFP is a bad match seriously. The extent of the usefulness for typology is categorising for comparing and explaining actions. My parents are INFX and ESTX, supposedly one of the worst combinations aside from ISFJ and ENTP, and they've been married for almost 20 years. \n\nAlso, I'm not an inept child!... I'm a procrastinating child. :P
2	i have been with my ldr girlfriend for over a year now She\s an INFP and im ISFP ,there are lots of emotions , if you both are mature enough there will be no need for either of you to take care of the other as we are Inept children, know that we're extremely laid back , so taking decisions might be a hassle , there has not been any conflicts between us till now , on the emotional side we both oooze love and affections and its pretty lovely .
5	Fi	Can you guys please give me personal experience on how you all use Fi? Also, what is Fi-Te loop? I'm just trying to better understand ISFP (my type). Thanks in advance. 
12	Hi! I'm kind of new to MBTI too, but here's kind of what I've gathered: \n\nFi is very individualistic. The two Fi-dom types, INFP and ISFP, are similar in that they tend to carry strong core values/evaluative judgments about everything, primarily without conscious thought. With INFP, this tends to manifest itself in strong core values about how they feel the world should work, or rights every person deserves and needs protected. This is why they get the reputation of being "social justice warriors", because their innermost core values are strongly concerned with protecting the human "self". With ISFP, this tends to manifest itself in more practical ways - our Fi almost acts as an intuition, guiding us towards situations, habits, values, and people we feel would be best for ourselves, while eschewing those that we find unsatisfactory in achieving our core values (regardless of what others or society may believe, which is what Fe is primarily concerned with). \n\nI personally have always had very strong opinions about avoiding alcohol/drugs and people who I know identify themselves with things of the sort; protecting people's individual rights (being gay, free to say what they want regardless of what others think); and being nice to others/treating them how you'd want to be treated. Fi is highly concerned with the self, while Fe is concerned with the harmony of the group, so if you're more in tune with how you're feeling and why as opposed to how a group you're a part of feels and why, it's probably a strong indicator of Fi. \n\nAdditionally, Fi makes us VERY sensitive! We don't tend to be open with our innermost feelings, because if they are invalidated, misunderstood, or simply ignored or made fun of, it basically tears apart the core of our being. You can see this with Fi-dom individuals like Britney Spears (ISFP) - when the media started to invalidate values that were close to her heart, like her relationship with her kids and her general morality as a human being (she's known for being somewhat naive/"real", which people interpreted as having a lack of intelligence and morals when she really is quite smart and kind), she obviously suffered the breakdown in 2007-08. Since then, it's safe to say she hasn't been the same, and this is kind of the epitome of a life-altering crisis for a Fi-user. \n\nI'm not too familiar with the Fi-Te loop, but I'm sure it has something to do with misinterpreting your environment/external sources of logic (Te) in order to validate certain unreasonable values or feelings you have (Fi). Our inferior function typically takes over in stressful situations, and it usually doesn't manifest itself healthily until we're really matured, so I think that's what it's about.\n\nHope that helped!
6	Personally, my Fi is the "why should I care" function. When I gather information with Se, it has to first go through my Fi filter. If I don't care, if it doesn't impact me or something or someone I value, I'll pretty much ignore the information. Unless it's a meme. Anyway.\n\nI find more so than the other functions it dictates my happiness levels - I don't know if this is a dominant function thing or a Fi thing. I can go for a while without much external stimulation, abstract thought, or organisation (Se, Ni, and Te respectively), but if I have to act different from how I am on the inside I get very unhappy very quickly. \n\nOf course, a negative aspect of this is that it can use itself against me. I will sometimes go into a weird state where I act extremely guarded and defend myself from anyone getting too close, all while telling myself it doesn't matter because it's what's on the inside that counts. It's pretty BS, and I know that it happens, but it still gets me.\n\nI'd say the main benefit of Fi is that I can translate emotion into my art quite naturally, in my case it's music. I see no reason it shouldn't work with other art forms though.\n\nI haven't heard of a Fi-Te loop before, nor have I experienced it from what I can guess what it is. Fi-Ni loops are all too common though, lol. I got stuck in one for around a whole year once. It's basically where I get super paranoid and interpret that everything people are saying is somehow insulting me, even if I can't explain it. I just assume their mocking is flying over my head. Also lots of edgy woe-is-me-my-life-will-always-be-horrible stuff.\n\nJust continuing off of that thing I said at the beginning, I actually very much enjoy philosophy - so long as it impacts me somehow. I think that's the difference in attitude to philosophy between ISFPs and INFPs. The Ne makes it so the very act of coming up with philosophical thoughts is what is interesting, while an ISFP will need Fi motivation for that.\n\nI'm totally not an expert though, lol. Take this all with a grain of salt.
2	About Fi- Te, its usually referred to as being in the 'grip of ones inferior function'. Simply put, when you're in the grip your words/ actions  tend to mimic the opposite type, in this case the EXTJs. Our inferior Te comes to the surface when we're trying to cope with a negative situation and our falliable (yet still trustworthy) Fi is unable to solve it. \n\nAnother loop that's extensively talked about is the Fi- Ni loop, which is quite common for ISFPs to experience. \n\n
0	Ive taken the test again and "mistyped" as ISFP	Ive been an INTP for quite a while now.. i remember taking the test like two years ago and getting INTP, ive took it a few dats ago and bam INTP again, then i read a thread about soneone advertizing their site that had the test too but with only 32 questions instead of 60 like the one from 16personalities, i took it and now im an ISFP :/, \n\nHeres the site if you want to check it out..\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
2	[deleted]
2	I took this quiz you linked us to. It got me spot on. Like the percentages are almost exactly the same as the 16 personalities. But thats just me. That doesn't mean you are wrong or not mistyped as one of us. Probably just a form of testing that isn't good for your type! try taking it like 3 times at different times of day or something and see if you get used to it. 
1	Lol im not advertizing or anything here xD
5	What do you think feels worse, when someone you’ve come to like and trust has harshly criticized you, or when they ignore you (ie texts or making plans)?	I always read about online how isfps are strongly affected when people they have let into their lives do something that hurts their feelings. I’m an isfp btw
9	Ignore makes me feel worse but I get over it quicker than criticism.
6	hm... i think the first one feels worse because that's like an "attack" against me. whereas ignoring me i tend to give the benefit of the doubt or i can shrug it off because i don't/won't really know what really happened(?), if that makes any sense.
4	I can handle criticism pretty well, and though it gets me down, I can get something meaningful out of it. Someone ignoring me just makes me feel unwanted, but I don't take it personally - healthy boundaries and expectations are important.
3	Uhhh both? Ignoring hurts more initially, criticism hurts forever/for longer.\n\nBeing ignored usually hurts more in the moment - I'm alone with my thoughts and all I can think about is how they hate me, how awful I am, worrying about why they're ignoring me, etc... While if somebody directly criticizes me I usually get swept up in that and trying to argue against it or talk about what I did that makes them say that, my focus is so much on the discussion/talking about the criticism in hypothetical terms, it's not yet turned inwards/'about me'.\n\nI'll forget about them ignoring me the next time we talk though, so long-term it makes no difference. The criticism on the other hand will stay with me forever and I'll constantly be seeking reassurance about it, belittling myself over it, worrying about it's accuracy, long after the other person and I have resolved the situation.
1	I take criticism to heart, whereas I couldn't care less if I'm being ignored.
1	Wow... I'm trying to figure which would bother my DH more... probably *harsh* criticism...  and I'm a natural at it. I can't aim it at him. 
1	It's worse when they ignore you because it leaves questions hanging and unresolved. Being harshly criticized can be hurtful but it's a step towards resolving whatever tension existed that lead to the criticism in the first place. 
1	Ignoring, because that kind of indicates that they don't care anymore. If they harshly criticize you, there's typically some sort of fear or insecurity on their end toward you that they don't know how to address healthily, and once you rationalize it out with them you realize it wasn't a huge deal in the first place and that it just showed they cared a lot (assuming they're reasonable people? Haha). \n\nBut at the same time, being ignored can be a little better because you can just kind of accept that you don't know what happened and that you can't control it. Regardless, both are definitely very hurtful and I try my best to avoid these as an ISFP too!
1	Neither really bothers me at all? 
1	I tend to need harsher criticism than people will give me. I find that though it might hurt my feelings I don't grow without someone pushing me hard. So I actually enjoy it when people I trust criticize me properly. But if its someone I don't know/trust/respect then I get hurt more long term. \nHowever if someone I love ignores me then I am really hurt. 
1	ignored sucks. being criticized means youre not being ignored.\n\ni just want to go back to my robot intj self. god damn emotions.
1	If you ignore me then I'm like .... next. Unless you're romantic/family , of course. \n\nHarsh criticism is in the eye of the beholder. If another person starts making it personal than, yeah, it can sting. But if it's legit than it might bother me but I'll take it to heart and keep what I think is appropriate, 
0	Being ignored. When a very close friend criticizes me, that means he is concerned but when i get ignored, that simply means that he does not care.
2	Test With Functions	Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. \n\nIt's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
7	i asked a male isfp out :p	hey guys\n\nI(infj,26) recently asked a guy(isfp,27) out. \n\nthis is my first time asking a guy out. i'm sick of hanging out with guys i am not interested in. \n\nanyway i think he's not interested in me. but he said yes anyway. i don't wanna freak him out, and just would like to get to know him. \nhow do you guys usually react when someone you're not interested in asked you out? 
14	I doubt he would have said yes if he wasn’t interested. ISFP’s are very non confrontational by nature, but if we didn’t want to do something we would always be able to come up with a polite excuse. Might as well just keep talking to him and see how it goes. Good luck!
13	I'd never go into relationship with someone I'm not interested in like that.\nI A. couldn't do that to myself and B. not to them. And I think most ISFPs'd agree with me :)
6	I would love for that to happen to me, I can never tell if someone likes me so that would make me get it. 
3	This literally just happened to me within the past month. I’m ISFP male, and at the time I wasn’t really looking for a relationship. Then I was asked out by my now girlfriend. I had only spoken to her once before then, and I thought she was nice, but like I said I wasn’t really looking for anything. Our first date was a bit awkward because I didn’t know what to talk about at all, but I’ve since become more comfortable and have opened up quite a bit. There’s still some awkward moments because I still don’t know what to talk about half the time, but things are going really well for the two of us. \n\nIf he’s like me more than just being ISFP, male, and asked out by a woman, the first date may be a bit awkward, but find out what he likes and talk about that, and that can get him to open up. Having an activity like a game, cooking something, or something else along those lines can also help him open up. \n\nMay the odds be ever in your favor!
4	I'm surprised he said yes but at the same time I'm not. I am an ISFP and typically when I am pursued by a girl I freak out and don't know how to cope so I turn them down and run the other way. (not literally) I usually tell them I'm not interested and don't encourage it. I'd assume he is interested if he said yes because of that.  
8	Rule Follower?	Hey Everyone!\n\nRecently people have been telling me that I am a rule follower and that I only see things in Black and White. Is this something that is a trait of ISFPs? Or am I a J or something?
8	It can be a strong indicator that you're ISFP, actually! Our dominant function is Fi, meaning we tend to hold strong opinions and core values that we rarely stray away from - this can easily apply to values like following rules, being honest, etc. Therefore, things can seem very black and white to us from a Fe user's standpoint, since they might not share the same innate desire to abide by such core values. They tend to abide by what the majority thinks or feels, which just so happens to be following rules.\n\nOthers might assume ISFP's don't tend to follow rules for a number of reasons: 1) Association with strong Se-doms like ESFP and ESTP, 2) Our stereotype as "non-conformist" (which is nevertheless true, but more applicable on a creative, aesthetic, or artistic level), 3) Our tendency to avoid commitment, which seems to correlate (but doesn't really) with a desire to break established rules, 4) Having the P as opposed to the J, which is widely misunderstood and has very few actual implications about being a rule follower or not.\n\nRegardless, if you still feel like you're questioning being typed as an ISFP, go back and look at each type's cognitive stack and see which one fits you best! Good luck :) 
4	It's a trait of ISFPs. 
8	Do you get easily stressed over life changes?	Getting my first car, a car I always dreamed to have and can only afford used. I can afford the car insurance, gas, etc., but despite that I am stressed out over the large bills that I will now be paying. I don't know why it winds me up so much but I worry about not being able to pay it/something bad might happen. It's a committment.
3	paying bills doesnt get me too stressedusually. Last minute plans that pop up that change my routine usually stress me more. 
2	Yeah, kinda, I mostly get anxious and want them to happen soon (when it's expected), but also stressed because I don't want to make mistakes.
1	Not much. I recently moved out and it really wasn't as stressful as I thought it was going to be. I think that's because my previous living situation was far *more* stressful than the stress of moving out. Plus I have a lot of help. But stuff like paying bills does make me anxious, but I don't stress about it.
1	Not really, i get excited, but not too much.
1	That sounds less like a "life change" problem and more of a money stress problem. And also a commitment stress. Money has always been one of my biggest stressors.
1	Change is usually exciting to me. I look forward to it. But then when it comes to committing to that change, I start to second guess it and I obsessively start doing research and asking for opinions/experiences of others to help put my mind at ease.
0	Need some Help :)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) \n\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is: \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\n\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!
1	This is just the 16personalities test with a few extra questions...\n\nPlus cognitive functions would be a better thing to test anyways. Testing individual traits tends to be a bit iffy. A lot of types often display many traits associated with the opposite for a trait. Take ISFPs for example - many ISFPs tend to favour art and creativity over practicality, despite having the S trait.
13	INTJ wife, ISFP husband....AMA	Realizing how unusual this paring is, and even moreso when it comes to long term success, I figured it would be cool to make an AMA. So, anything you guys want to know about INTJ female and ISFP male pairings, ask away. We've been married for many years, have 2 children, and it is a strangely complimentary relationship now but the early days were brutal....TBH, I'm surprised we made it even.
3	What do you mean brutal?
3	Currently an INTJ boyfriend with an ISFP girlfriend actually. So I guess I've a few curious questions, some practical, some just for fun:\n\n* How exactly did you get married? With a ceremony? How'd that go?\n\n* Do you find classic gender roles getting in the way or have you guys dismissed them entirely? Perhaps it's different in my case as the male and she the female, but our types seem more balanced in masculinity/femininity. I find that she is handier than me, typically takes care of most house projects. I try to help with chores and we typically cook together. I own the house and don't ask for rent, so I ask that she take care of groceries and basic house needs. When we go out, I still feel compelled to cover both our meals because that's just the gender expectation. Else I'd like to think there's no concept of the "man of the house" nor the "housewife", just two partners figuring it out together, but this seems more difficult for other people to accept. \n\n* If you don't mind getting even more personal, how has the whole children thing worked out in general? What role do you each play in their lives? I somewhat fear the idea of having children yet accept that it's entirely likely and not something I'll always dread as I age. I don't know how supportive I'd be of them, but I'd want to raise them to be independent and creative individuals. \n\n* Have you found success in motivating your partner to do anything? Beyond favors, it seems hard for us to get each other to actually stick to our goals and projects. Like, I don't want to seem pushy and controlling, but at the same time I really want to see her succeed and to stop complaining or saying "I really ought to...". 
2	How did you guys meet? Do you guys work in the same/a similar industry?
1	Please give me a formula for conflict resolution!
1	i take it as you are the more robotic one and he is the emotional one? does he make a stand first on things or do you, i.e. someone says something rude to you in a public setting.\n\ni tend to get all emotionny during a breakup and it messes up my whole mentallity for a brief time, and it shows on tests when i take them during said time. i yearn to get back to my robot self. but while im all sensoryfeeler i actually stand up for myself more than usual, where i just let everything slide cause i cant be bothered.
4	ISFP secrecy? What is the difference with Privacy?	INFJ rant ahead.\nMy S.O when he has some serious worries, is becoming very secretive. As an intuitive, i just feel it from miles away, my gut never betrayed me. Last time, about a week ago, I asked him politely if everything was alright and he said that there is no reason for me to ask this question, that everything was alright and that "it is just  your feeling". As the INFJ that I am, it made me question what im basing this feeling on. I tried really hard to make myself believe that there is no logical reason to feel that way. See the contradiction. I was trying to reason my gut feeling. While i tried to make myself feel better about it and believe the ISFP, the feeling would not go away. Today, I again politely asked him if there was anything wrong with him and if  there is, if he could share it. He confess that there is something going on and that he wants to keep it for himself. One thing is his privacy and I get it, because I need it too. But this made me feel betrayed. He made me question myself, doubt my gut feeling, when in fact it was right from the start. It drove me furious and in a controlled way, I let it out. It is shredding my trust for him and his credibility and this is a critical thing for me (and INFJ in general). It is not the first time and it ends up in his apologies and then in phrases that go like "I did not mean to...", "I thought  you would not ask me again that question..", or "I did not think you would take it that way..". It is becoming utterly disappointing and there is nothing I can do to stop this feeling. I love him, but I dont know how much longer I can keep up with it.  Any comment is more than welcome.
9	i know personally when people ask how i am doing or if anything is wrong, i pretty much always say i'm ok; no matter how close to the person i am or not. part of it is because i don't like to show my "weak side" because i'm generally a positive and happy person & i don't want to worry people. but honestly, most of the time i don't share what/how i'm feeling until i feel *ready* to share. even if i may *want* to share what's going on that doesn't always mean i'm *ready*. and for me it takes a long time to feel that way and also process just.. everything. sometimes even - when i come to terms with whatever's happening, in the end i may decide not to share what's going on after all. because i'll decide it just doesn't matter anymore or doesn't help to share, and that's ok. \ni actually feel really happy when people constantly check up on me even though i may find it annoying at times, but it shows they care; as long as it's genuine, which i'm sure you are being. so i would say keep asking once in a while, just so they know you care. it helps a lot even though it may not seem like you're doing much. \nbut yeah, not sure if your s.o feels the same as me, but hope this helps. in my experience it's nothing about not trusting someone, privacy, or anything like that. it's just how i feel and what i decide is best for me even if the other person might not understand. 
9	I can't speak for your S. O., only for myself.  When I have issues or problems that I see have no solution I don't like to share them.  It makes me feel like I'm just giving my loved ones more things to worry about,  and since I don't see the answer it's like giving someone a puzzle with pieces missing.  In other words it feels cruel,  like I'm tormenting them with my issues.  This may be what your S. O. is feeling,  but I can't say for sure. 
2	I understand both of you.\nBut since I more than often did or would behave the same way here is my guess. Maybe he‘s not sure about whatever is going on and before telling you about it he needs to sort his thoughts. Maybe he didn’t want to hurt you by telling you that there is something going on but not telling what since he first has to go through it alone and he didn‘t want to burden you with it. At least that would be my approach and I understand why it upsets you... and I‘m sure he does too! But in my opinion this is not about trust.
2	if he doesn't want to talk about, then he doesn't want to talk about. This has nothing to do with trust--he just wanted to keep this information to himself. Nbd. 
1	Always listen to your gut. Especially in relationships.\n\nThere's a difference between him having a minor thing that he's not ready to share yet, and a major thing that's he's being secretive about. I would think that now you know there is "something" whether it's minor or major that there's a timeline of sorts with him being communicative. Really all you can do express is that you've been picking up "vibes" from him, that you care for him, and you're open to talking about something when he's ready to share.\nA "penny for your thoughts" type thing... \n\nThe problem comes is when you can clearly sense it, they deny it, and you start questioning yourself. If it goes on long enough, I know I tend to start picking at that "scab" to get them to open up. If I suspect it's a relationship-threatening issue (cheating/lying) then I'll start digging to find out what's going on (hate that i do it but it is what it is) . When it comes to these larger cheating/betrayal issues, My gut has NEVER been wrong. \n\nbut, yeah, huge difference between a minor issue that he's trying to sort out in his head or something much much larger. 
9	SchizoPoem.#1:	(Please forgive me for posting so much, \nI hope I'm not annoying anyone.. I'd like to Post a poem for those who would care to read and tell me what they think? \nThank you friends.)\n\n------------------!-----------\n\nAll I can eat these days is smoke.\n\nWater from the tap keeps dripping and I feel annoyed.\n\nI wonder where you went. \n\nThe day you left me behind.\n\n \nYou walked through the clouds as the sky fell apart like shattered glass. \n\nI stood below the waters watching as I always do. \n\nI never was one for action.\n\nI find myself when it's too late.\n\nEyes like the sun looking down on me. \n\nI never could feel your warmth, despite my leather skin.\n\nI bet you're laughing up there.\n\n \nPoor baby bird thought a snake was his own mother.\n\n\n Hallucinatory gaze melting away the chromosomes.\n\nIs that even possible when love is abstract?\n\nI should go back to sleep. \n\nIt's the only escape. \n\nBut please, never stop singing. \n\nDo that and I promise to stare into a mirror for eternity.\n\nOr atleast until the stars are swallowed by the sea. \n\nI can settle for that.
2	I don't know much about poetry, but I like it. And right back at you: please, never stop singing.
8	What are your thoughts on lyrics?	I really don't care about them, unless they're funny or disturbing. They don't make sense to me, and I don't really care about meaning.
13	i usually listen to how a song sounds rather than looking for good lyrics. sometimes i don't realize that a song i really like also has good lyrics/meaning til weeks later lol. but yeah when i do come across nice lyrics i enjoy them but i don't actively look or listen for it
7	I don't hear them until I know I like the beat/melody. They also have to fit with the song
4	I care when I'm down and listening to sad songs, I don't care when in a happy/neutral mood and listening to more upbeat songs.
4	Oh man bless this post..... I really could care less if the lyrics are unintelligible or in another language, if it sounds good/catchy/makes me feel something, then I love it! 
3	I used to only listen to music without lyrics, but I like a lot of songs with lyrics now. I think about the meaning sometimes, it depends on the song 
3	verry often when I try to sing a song in my head I have to realize that I actually never lsitened to the lyrics and only can repeat the melody and sounds ^^
2	I like them for their aesthetic appeal (i.e. where the voice/certain phrases lends some unique taste to a song) but generally the interpretation of the lyrics doesn't really matter to me. More so the beat/melody of the song :) 
2	i care mainly about meaning when im listening to music. I like lyrically driven artists like Peter Gabriel. 
1	They're part of the rhythm and melody of the music, that part is really important, but meaning is not necessary to have a good song. Although deep lyrics would be some addition to a music.
14	Suicide.	(Please forgive me if by posting this I offend or trigger anyone. This is merely a cathartic statement I've written for myself that I wish to share with others. Please indulge me by reading and letting me know what you think of my opinion on the struggle against suicide. Thank you.)\n\nI know how it feels to feel down and out. \n\nTo feel broken. \n\nWaking up every morning questioning my own existence and it's value to other people and significance to the world. \n\nI know how it feels to wear a mask for the sake of others while trying my best to fool myself into believing that very mask is my true face. \n\nThe wish to die is not brought by pain, it's brought by fear. \n\nPain can be managed, decompressed and dealt with. Pain is an aching sort of ailment, dull, depressive and hollow. But fear is far more potent. It is sharp and always felt. Fear is a difficult and ruthless beast. \n\nFear gnaws away at your soul until you lose all control. You can't escape it. You can attempt disassociation or whatever other concievable coping mechanism imaginable, but fear will always wait for you at the door. \n\nFear that you are not good enough, that you will never succeed. Fear that you are not loved, that you are hated, ugly and unecessary. Worthless. Pathetic. Disgusting. Unworthy. Fake. \n\nFear is masterful in the art of deception. You lie to yourself and are caught in a cycle of self defeat due to false beliefs constructed by your own insecurities and weaknesses that fear uses against you to manipulate you into sabatoging yourself.\n\nThe only way to combat fear is to confront it. \n\nTo confront fear is to confront yourself. \n\nConfronting oneself and emerging victorious is torturous. But a Phoenix must rise from it's ashes if it is to fly.\n\nShedding the ashes of insecurity, doubt and self hate and bursting into flame. All of your weakness melting away as you spread your wings taking to the sky, soaring towards the sun reborn. \n\nTo live is to reinvent yourself.\n\nThe wish to die may never leave me and fear will always remind me of it's power and presence, but the beauty of the Phoenix is the power of rebirth. \n\nTo die, to rise, to die, to rise. Never giving up. The eternal fight and cycle. \n\nSo yes, I am one of many broken people. The desire for death I recognize is a part of me, yet despite that curse I realize I also desire to live. So I will struggle against fear to continue to live. \n\nI may lose battles now and again, but I refuse to lose the war.\n\nI know some days I will be deceived and fall into despair. But I won't give up. No one should give up. It doesn't matter how far you fall. You can always climb back up. \n\nFailure is a choice.\n\nEven if you lose your legs and are unable to stand, crawl. Surrendering is the greatest weakness of all. It is true cowardice. If you continue to fight, you will discover that drive to live is an unlimited source of power you can tap into whenever you need it most. \n\nThat power is within you and will always be within you. It's your identity.\n\nA human soul is the greatest weapon of all convention. Never turn that blade toward yourself, but to the heart of the negative manifestations that afflict you. \n\nThere is a path out of darkness and into light only if you remove your hand from your eyes. \n\n
4	Hey, hello there. I guess that if you posted this here then you won't mind me stating an opinion on it (yes you kind of said that in the description but just in case).\nThere was a time when I felt suicidal myself, i don't feel like that anymore. It was because of fear too, in my case, a fear of being unable to deal with the world socially and failing college and consequently losing my freedom by having a shitty job, being unlovable and not being able to travel the world. Phew..\nI was in a deep pit of despair, even went to therapy and couldn't trust the therapyst and lied. \nWhat has worked for me was: time, lots of time, thinking a lot, being inside my head, isolating, suffering, you name it. Eventually my fatalistic conclutions about the world started to get simpler, i could define my fears concretely, i got real honest with myself, even if it was silly, feelings are valid. Things turned less and less important when i realized that other people were able to live different realities to mine and keep breathing, the whole world is built on opinions, perspectives, humans invented this whole social thing, even words, everything is extremely relative and your mind might tend to lock itself into what you already have experienced, your town, school, whatever, and you might think your life will never change (Isfp nightmare!). I won't tell you to not suffer, or to get thougher 'cause "life is hard", no one is right or wrong about anything, if you need to get deeper into that pit of despair do it, but also get out there, have as many experiences as you can and while you're at it try to clear your mind from any previous thoughts you've ever had, be blank, take everything in, nature, people, try not to speak inside your mind.\nMbti advice: you say you're an ISFP (me too), you sound like you're on an Fi-Ni loop. \nhttp://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory#tert (please read this where it says "Tertiary Ni (ISFP)  )\nMy advice basically is using Se, telling Ni to f*ck off a bit :) . (that's a daily struggle hah)\n\nBtw, you might relate to this song: https://youtu.be/dnxCxHLAqn8 (Mbti talk, this guy is most likely an isfp too) when I'm down/lost/want to feel something deep, i usually listen to him. /also this song by the same guy https://youtu.be/ADP65wbBUpc (the lyrics are really good)\n\nAlright that took me like an hour to write D': . please, process my words (?) visit the links, don't make me lose faith in humanity lol, comment afterwards? Have an awesome day!!! *sending good vibes your way*
3	Hey! I remember you posted a poem here a while back-- and then deleted it. Don't be so hard on yourself. The stereotype is that isfps are laid-back, but a lot of people don't see how troubled and turbulent we can be. 
2	[deleted]
2	Thank you for sharing your story. Your experiences are valid and your voice is worth being heard. You are a resilient survivor and I think that's incredibly brave and admirable. Try your best, keep on persevering. You are worth it. <3 
19	Love being creative but held back by fear of criticism	Does anyone else relate? I love and want to be creative but I feel so held back by the fear of criticism, as well as a strive for perfection. I find it hard to fully commit to a project or I will often turn down bigger projects that I don’t feel ready for, because I can’t stand the thought of putting my work out there and people criticising it. I know the only way for me to progress and get over it is to practice and persevere, but it’s become a horrible cycle. How do people do it !?
4	In my opinion, it's great that you are able to define your fears, that's the first step to overcoming them. You don't need to brush it off, that doesn't work in my experience. Don't try to hide it, but overcompensate by facing it, being brave takes a lot of courage, you will be proud of yourself even if you were 'shaking' by the thought of it. Practice having your fear in mind and how much knowledge you'll gain by either failing or succeding, each time you'll learn something new and it will likely inspire your craft and improve your life overall. In conclution, my advice would be: focus on knowlegde and gains, and take fear as a trigger to go forward.\n\nHope it helps!\n\nEdit: btw, i do relate, i think about my fears everyday, but try to not let them overwhelm me and prefer to just go out there and receive feedback from the real world, not so much from my head.
2	Well, you just have to get rid of that by doing it. You'll never get good if you don't do it. Stop caring about what others will think and start getting better at what you like to do.
2	Remember it's okay to fail. It's okay if people didn't like it. It doesn't say anything about you.\n\nWhat matters is if you stayed true to yourself, if what you put out there is exactly what you wanted to portray, if you spent your best hours working on it. Because these are the only things you can control. These are the things that say a lot about you.\n\nIt's when you have worked on these, people will maybe come rooting for you. Or not. You can't control people. So why do you care? Take their criticism and learn everything you can out of it, that is under your power.\n\nHere, this might help. https://youtu.be/ivfspJOAtBI
2	Hey, believe me, even I dislike it. I program and part of our regular process is that we review each other's code when we make fixes for bugs. I never want to look like a fool in front of the other developers, so I shy away from more complicated problems that involve more changes. Before the process was more formalized, I avoided requesting code reviews, but the result was that my code was less reliable. What ultimately hurt me more was a published mistake, not a private critical review. And the more you allow yourself to be criticized, chances are the less you'll end up needing criticism in the future, as you improve you'll become better and things will go from being embarrassing mistakes to being nit-picky opinions. \n\nI think this might be similar for you guys. Just know that people only criticize for one of two reasons:\n\n1. Hopefully, typically, they just want to see you improve. They're interested in your future well-being and want to see you succeed. Of course no one came out the womb walking, and you had to stumble a few times before you got it right, but man I bet your parents were so happy to see you getting it down. These people don't mean to hurt you. No one started off amazing at what they loved, it required a lot of practice, and no one should shame you for being in the crawling stages. \n\n2. Unfortunately, some people are truly insecure themselves. But don't let them drag you down with them. That's their goal. They don't know how to prop themselves up on their own or get people to voluntarily hold them up, so they try to stomp and climb on the defeat of others to make them feel better about their inferior selves. In fact, this applies to insults in general. If anyone ever tries to put you down, just think "you poor soul, you're hurting enough that you feel the need to take it out on someone else. I'm above this. I will grow and you will not be able to hurt me any longer." \n\nUltimately, it's just a process, a habit, that you get used to the more you do it. It'll start off very painful, but then you'll get over it until it just becomes another normal element of life. What I also found helpful was making friends with people who are open to criticism themselves. They'll ask for your honest thoughts and then react positively to them, making you more comfortable with the idea of asking for their own opinions knowing there's mutual respect between you. 
7	How do you cope with deadlines?	I'm in the middle of my exams right now and looking at my peers study so consistently for long stretches at a time has made me wonder if I'm the only one who can't sit myself down. My friends can remain undistracted for hours on end and I can barely resist the urge to keep myself from procrastinating. I realise this isn't just with academics, but with other IRL stuff too. \n\nI thought you guys would have similar experiences and was wondering how you managed to work around/deal with it?
6	I procrastinate unless i REALLY care about something (which is rare). My advice: start chasing the things you really really care about, and deadlines will still be annoying, but you'll likely be drawn to complete your projects/assignments if the reward is exciting novelty (even if you still procrastinate a little). School sucked for me for the very same reason as yours, i dropped-out my engineering studies and i'm persuing something more hands-on. Had to complete high-school though :')
5	I don't, I just procrastinate, lol.
3	Having some loose structure helps compensate when I'm doing work I'm not passionate about. Often that means taking short breaks often (either once I've done X amount of work, or a spent a set amount time working). But what's more important here is having a defined end to the break, or else I'll get lost in that and never return to my work, lol.\n\nThat said, these aren't exactly rules or anything. Whenever I'm having trouble focusing, I know it's time for a break, regardless of the above-mentioned stuff. Or if I've got a good momentum going, I'll just go with it. But those guidelines help reel me back in when my self-direction falters.
3	I usually wait until the last couple days to get it done. Not *the* last day, but maybe the day before.\n\nI wait because I have a hard time focusing, too. When I become focused, I go into "focus-mode" and I don't like to waste it. So I wait until I have enough time and energy to go into focus-mode and then I get it done. When I start having trouble focusing, I take a break. A pretty simple break, like I don't do anything that requires too much focus or else I'll get into "focus-mode" on that and waste time. \n\nSo my advice is when you start getting distracted, take a short, simple break. good luck with your exams!
3	i don't really have a healthy way of coping with deadlines... i always procrastinate but in the end things usually turn out well. i think i work better that way (?) idk lol. 
2	I like to do things quickly so I'm free later. I only procrastinate if I don't have energy or really don't want to. Resting a bit after getting some work done and then going back at it helps me to keep getting what I need done.
1	I love the deadline crunch personally. The this had to get done or else motivated me the most. 
8	Anybody struggle with eating too much?	I don't know if this is because of Se or whatever, but every time I sit down and eat I literally can't stop because I enjoy the taste of food so much. It'll get to the point where I'm uncomfortably full, and at that point I force myself to stop. Anybody else experience something similar?
10	i definitely eat out of boredom, for similar reasons. (the taste is incredible to the point where sometimes i just want to experience flavour) but i'm decent at controlling myself and don't eat large quantities in single sittings. i'm a small snacks throughout the day kinda dude.
7	I’m the complete opposite! I struggle to feel hungry at the “right” times (breakfast, lunch etc). Especially if I’m concentrating at work, I won’t eat until dinner.  I also struggle to eat a whole meal in one sitting and will have to put it to the side to finish later. 
8	I have the opposite problem, I have a hard time eating enough. I've gotten used to it now though, but overeating has never been an issue for me
3	yes i also have this problem! it is a struggle. never considered it being related
1	Yes! Not so much quantity but frequency, for me. I snack a lot at work. Engaging the senses with something interesting (taste or texture or temperature-wise) helps keep my mind on task when the work itself is not particularly interesting. But also yeah, if it's tasty it's hard to stop.
8	How do you guys react to flirting?	I'm saying subtle flirting like some touches here and there, maybe saying some playful things. Nothing too excessive. Would you guys actually register it as flirting? And if you do, how would you react to people you like vs people you are not interested in? Would be nice to get some ISFP males' input, but anything is welcome :)
18	I can only speak for myself, but as a female ISFP, here are my thoughts:\n\nI think too little of myself/am too humble to ever realize someone's actually flirting with me. I will always assume they're being friendly, because *How embarrassing would it be to assume they were flirting with me, and who am I to assume their intentions?!* Come on too strong when I'm not interested and I will (politely) run away and will never be heard or seen again. Coming on too strong when I'm interested? Nervous, polite giggles and internally thinking *SAY SOMETHING BACK! QUICK! UUHHH HOW DO I DO THIS* Most things could be seen as too fast/too soon to us, because we value our own comfort and space so much. I think the key is to communicate honestly about your intentions/interest in us, because even though ISFPs will be the last person to confront someone, it'll calm us down to know exactly what you're thinking.\n\nI'm dating an ENTJ, and the reason why we're together is because he patiently waited for my walls to come down :)
9	Idk, but it would be completely awkward. 
7	Male ISFP, I assume no one would ever be interested in me and never know if someone is flirting or likes me unless someone points it out and even then I typically don’t really believe them. It sucks really because I’m 23 and have never been in a relationship or done anything. I would like to but can never tell.
3	I am an ISFP male and I feel like I notice it most of the time, but I don't think I'm very good at flirting back. The only times I actively flirt is when I really like the other person and feel like there is good chemistry between us. If it's somebody I'm not sure about or I'm in an uncomfortable position to flirt(like at work) then I just try to be nice without being too playful\n\nSomebody has been flirting with me for a while recently, and I try to flirt back a bit but I don't think we mesh that well, though it's hard to tell. I don't want to be in a relationship with them, but I'd be fine with something more than just friends - though I don't know how they feel about it or how I'd talk to them about that. 
2	I shrug it off but most of the time I am not cool enough to shrug it off so I am just Standing there looking totally awkard and uncomfortable.
1	As an isfp female i can tell immediately when I'm being flirted with but im not smooth enough to flirt back so i freeze up and get very tense and nervous. Ive never been able to flirt successfully at all :P
3	to the isfps?	hey so i enjoy reading up on mbti,and a question came to me,since isfps have fi se ni te they should have a very abstract inner world,since they only have inferior te they should be very illogical or right brained?so what is your guys experinces with this?,do you often  struggle putting certain experinces in words?,if so what are those experinces?,also how does an inner fi and ni fuse together to create realy abstract ideas?like what kinds of ideas do you guys get?
9	> do you often struggle putting certain experinces in words?\n\nyes - I am bad with words + numbers ! 
5	>since they only have inferior te they should be very illogical or right brained?\n\nSome. For me, definitely. Especially when brain fog takes over and makes me unable to even process what I'm suppose to do. But my Te has been improving. I'll want to know both sides of an argument (and will try to understand their points of view). I start to want to be fair rather than seek mercy for everything (though this could be my Fi talking).\n\n>so what is your guys experinces with this?\n\nNot necessary experiences here (see the next question), but rather characteristics. How I'm illogical: I'm not that smart, I am quite bias and would choose a side of an argument before even listening to the points (although I am easily convinced and would move to the other side if I'm not feeling stubborn), I experience brain fog... a lot, and if you use big complicated words I'm not even listening. How I'm righted brained (although I am a little left brained): I'm creative (at least to the average sensor), put feelings over emotions, extremely laid-back, likes to relax, empathetic, and my brain fog now has taken place. Gosh dang it!\n\n>do you often struggle putting certain experinces in words?\n\nYes. I'm even struggling to put my many experiences of this in words. :p\n\n>if so what are those experinces?\n\nHow am I suppose to tell you? Might as well make a picture of it since every experience I see is like a movie or cartoon from my point of view.\n\n>also how does an inner fi and ni fuse together to create realy abstract ideas?\n\nI just like imagining things. I'm interested in ideas but only creates abstract ideas every now and then (although I would invest in this idea I developed and try to make it make sense before moving on so that could be a reason). Usually, our ideas (or at least mine) isn't really abstract. Rather, because of our Fi, we tend to create ideas that will move people. If you really want an abstract, go to someone else who actually thinks. But if you want someone who will make you feel a specific strong emotion our Fi is bottling up, you came to the right person.\n\n>like what kinds of ideas do you guys get?\n\nDefinitely not abstract. But it really depends on my mood. If I'm sad, I'll create sad ideas. If I'm happy, I'll think of ideas that will make me even happier (usually jokes). If I'm stressed, all my ideas would be about me panicking trying to get my stuff together. You get the point.\n\nHoped it helped!
4	Not ISFP, but seeing as they mostly use Se to take in information, I would suppose they are good at creating stuff that appeals to the five senses - visual and auditory mainly. Something aesthetically appealing, that is more likely to be widely appreciated by even the average sensor type, as compared to say INFP with their more out-of-the-world Ne.\n\nedit: Therefore what I mean is that they are not necessarily so abstract.\n\nWould be nice for the real ISFPs here to confirm/disprove my theory!
8	Mistyped as an INFP?	Hey guys, I just wanted to know if any of you guys have had this “problem”...\n\nFor the past 2 years I was convinced that I was an INFP despite not totally identifying with all of the traits (I.e. being super emotional, being an strong writer, and being a social justice warrior/hella empathetic)\n\nAfter reading the ISFP description I’m pretty sure that I am an ISFP and not an INFP. However I’ve taken the MBTI 5 tines and come out as INFP every time. \n\nIdk anyone else had that?
5	Online tests are never** a good idea. Please read up cognitive functions descriptions for Fi, Se, Ne, Ni, Si, Te (there are posts on personalitycafe by Lenore Thompson which explains each). \n\nBoth ISFPs and and INFPs have Introverted Feeling (Fi) as their dominant/first function. You most likely to be IXFP if you relate strongly to Fi. \n\nFrom there it diverges, your secondary function will either be Extroverted Sensing (Se) if you're ISFP, and Extroverted Intuition (Ne) if you're INFP whichever you feel describes you better is the one. \n\nAlso the tertiary, Introverted Intuition (Ni) for ISFP and Introverted Sensing (Si) for INFP should help confirm your type. We share the same inferior/ last function that is Extroverted Thinking (Te).\n\nISFP has Fi, Se, Ni, Te\n\nINFP has Fi, Ne, Si, Te \n\nRead the ISFP/ INFP description from 16personalities.com, personally I prefer their type descriptions over others.
3	Which test you took? Some tests are biased towards n. And isfps are definitely very intuitive for sensors. Hell, i mistyped myself as an intp because of a bad test.
2	I'm still not 100% convinced I'm ISFP, most tests do tell me I'm a S, and not a N, though.
2	I always test as ENFP. It's weird cuz I definitely have some of the Ne dom traits, but isfp just feels right.\n\nI'm a musician, people always describe me as the super chill guy, and I just can't relate to the overly bubbly ENFP stereotype. Afterall, there aren't just 16 personalities, more like 7.5 billion. 
1	I took the test a month ago and was an INFP and now I’m an ISFP. I was going through a bit of depression last month I think it influenced my personality type. 
1	Yea I get infp most of the time but i get the sense that im actually isfp :P
1	I mistyped years ago and thought i was an INFP but actually I was ISFP! Glad I figured it out. Tests online are tricky. 
6	INFJ male has ISFP female gradually close off her emotional constraint completely	Male INFJ I've been crazy in love with a female ISFP for nearly 17 years now. God I've held onto her for the longest time yet over that time she has emotionally constrained herself to the point of no communication for nearly three years now. I believed and believed yes I know I'm crazy but when I fell in love with her at the beginning I made a vow in my heart that I would do whatever it takes to love her, and that included every worst case scenario. Anyway worst case scenario happened and true to my vow I have kept my heart's love alive for her since. But God is so hard to love someone who has become so emotionally constrained to this degree. I've been burned out on her emotional constrained behaviour before. Enduring 6 months of no contact. Endured 18 months after she moved of her not letting me know where she was. This time it's been 3 years almost with no text messages whatsoever from her, never mind verbal communication, that's definitely not happening. Can I hang in there and win her heart eventually, will she ever stop constraining herself to this degree? I have too many words and emotions that I can't possibly do justice to the entire story, this is but a snippet of the whole picture. 
6	She's being very clear with you. Respect her boundaries and let her go.
5	Sounds like she's avoiding you and probably living her own life. This might sound like a crazy idea, but maybe you should leave her alone? 
4	over 5 years total of nothing sounds like she is just not interested\ni cant even see a Fi user being that private or incommunicative\ni know it will be hard to let go, but you probably should think about this further because that isnt behavior a Fi user would do in love, it is too detached
2	you need to just let her go, this can't be good for your mental health.
2	Not gonna happen. Giving up and letting her go is the only reasonable choice. She doesn't want anything with you, and if you keep trying it's more unlikely that she'll want.
2	We have two sons together. My question is when is I will love you forever meant to stop believing in that principle?
1	3 years no contact, and you're still this torn up?\n\nYou need peace, man. And some therapy to learn how to let this go. \n\nI realize you have 2 kids from the posts previous which complicates everything. I'm not sure the age of your children, but if they are 18+ it makes sense why there'd be no contact for 3 years. If they are under 18 then I'm not sure how there's not been any communication for that long. Do the kids live with you or her? Do you have contact with the children if they don't? \n\nAre you in love with her or in love with the idea of your family being together?\n\n
16	ISFP and texting	Hello. First time poster! \n\nI’ve re-written this post so many times cause I can’t seem to make it make sense! But here goes...\n\nI am intrigued about how you fellow ISFPs feel about texting? I don’t mind sending texts when I have to. In general, I prefer to write down what I have to say as I am able to choose my words carefully, and I find it much easier to collect my thoughts. However, I hate receiving texts. The feeling of having to reply straight away makes me feel anxious and as well as that, I often seem to misread the context of texts or I sense the wrong tone. This usually results in unneccesary arguments or I end up feeling annoyed and confused because I don’t understand what the other person is trying to say/or why they’re choosing to text me this? I think in general I prefer to have conversations face to face.\n\nSo, my best friend loves to text. She’s the kind of person who will send several bursts of texts, that she could just write in one text. She will always be the first person to text at the beginning of the day. If she didn’t text me, we probably wouldn’t talk for days. She also texts more friviously, whereas when I text someone it’s for a purpose. Some of the things she’s texts really annoy me sometimes and I often wonder why she is texting me such things and I’ll find myself feeling annoyed with her, when really there is nothing to be annoyed about.  When I see her in person we’ll be chatting away and getting on like a house on fire, and there are no misunderstandings.\n\nI guess I’m just asking/wondering if anyone else feels the same way about texting? Or often misreads tone/context? What are your texting habits?\n\n\n\n\n\n
16	Worth the effort to make the post, IMO. You got ISFPs to engage on this sub, which isn't easy! We may not all agree, but we must all deeply care about communication since you got us to come out of the woodwork.\n\nPersonally I'm with you, I hate texting and I'd even say I wish it didn't exist. I hate the sense of urgency it creates, and the lack of clarity. My new boss texts me all the time and the combination of urgency with unclear instructions is crazy-making. In a different context, it also distances me from people. Some close family members would rather text than call, which makes me feel lonely. Boo to texting!
8	I'm the same way. I usually don't text people back right away just because I don't feel like talking, though. It's annoying to me when people want my constant attention. That might sound pretty harsh, but there's better things to do than sit on a phone all day typing to people incessantly. I only have a few friends outside of my family that I talk to everyday. But since i talk to them on a daily basis, I don't feel the need to keep a conversation going on and on and on unless we're together in person (like you said). I find it draining and I don't like when people get mad just because I don't have my phone on me all the time when we just talked an hour ago. If it's an emergency, I would understand. But I feel like people are too reliant on technology and forget there's a world outside of a phone screen lol. 
3	I prefer writing communication versus verbal. I have been known to ignore a message if the person deserves it though - I am passive aggressive in those instances. \nWhat you can think of when your BFF is texting you, is that she's seeking something to connect you two, which ISFPs love. Maybe look at it from that perspective? 
3	I prefer texting over calling because of what you said, I can write out my response and refine it without being expected to immediately speak. I find it more difficult to talk on the phone because I can’t see their facial expressions, and if someone/something else near me makes a sound or moves, I get distracted and forget what we were talking about. I do call people on occasion, but that’s only if I need information right away.\n\nI usually remember to text someone back rather than call them back, probably because texting is easier for me to do. Speaking of which, I told one of my friends that I would call him back the next day and it’s been 4 months now... 😬\n\nBut yeah, I generally like texting better
3	i prefer texting over calling, but i prefer to talk in person over texting. when it comes to texting though, i ignore messages a lot especially if i'm not in the mood to talk or answer which is a lot of the time :P \nbut yeah i like texting because i can take as long as i want to think about how i want to respond \n\noh and i don't really misread/misinterpret text messages that often! 
2	I normally like texting when there's a meaning to it, I hate small talk... but I have such a friend too. She's ESFJ.\nShe texts me things like "Today I've been on the toilet three times already", which is no problem for me, my reply will just be an emoticon if at all.. But more than often she also texts me before she sends an email or a text to her lover(s) and asks me "is it okay to write it like this.." or something like that. Or sending me pictures of her to tell her if she looks good and which one should be her next profile picture (my mother for example knows exactly who is texting me when she sees me rolling my eyes).\nLately I ignore these texts too because I told her more than once to decide on her own ......but she also annoys me when we meet face to face and spend too much time together because her need for constant affirmation is very exhausting.\n\nBut I also know what you mean with the feeling of having to reply straight away and I also have a problem with misinterpretation of texts.. sometimes I have days on which I don't reply to anyone if it doesn't seem important, I guess my friends are used to it by now..
2	The Tl;Dr of my thoughts is Calling < Texting < Proper, human contact. I generally prefer calling as I feel more interesting and can keep a conversation going better, but setting aside the time to call feels like too much. Plus, I'm kinda paranoid about my privacy, so the thought of people being able to hear my conversations is pretty nerve-wracking. Still, neither beat being able to hang out with a friend, which I guess is a given
2	The don't usually reach out to text someone unless I have a need, or something reminded me of them or I think they would find it funny etc. That being said I'm a terrible texter, and I worry sometimes that my tone comes off different than I intended when I text. Maybe it's an ISFP thing, maybe it's a human thing!
2	I only like texting for people I really know as I understand them and they understand me and it allows me to be kind of socal without the exhaustion that comes with it.
1	Completely depends, if it's just talking to a friend, I prefer face to face the most, then texting, then calling. If it's something important, I'm fine with everything except for calling, I really hate calling.
1	Are you on the spectrum?
5	Never been in a relationship and currently have no desire to	Curious to see if there are others similar to me, as I have yet to meet someone that is anywhere near similar.\n\nI’m a 24 year old average female, and an ISFP, which I believe may add some insight as to why I enjoy being alone. I’m very much in the moment and I’m horrible at planning, whether it’s short term or long term. \n\nI have never once been in a relationship or desired a relationship, although I’ve had many opportunities to have one. I have a guy friend currently that I enjoy talking to and is undoubtedly attracted to me and doesn’t shy in letting me know, but as soon as I even envision being in a relationship I get a sort of anxiety and ignore any advance at dating. \n\nI have many friends that are married, dating, or cannot emotionally be single and must always be in a relationship, that have been puzzled as to how I could possibly be content and full on my own. I’ve even had a friend ask to tell her friend how great it is to be single and not need to constantly search for male interaction. It felt very odd trying to explain how I’ve always been, just as she would feel odd explaining why she feels the need to have a constant companion. I’m somehow the friend that gives amazing advice without even having experience in relationships, having the ability to observe everything I’ve seen and put it together for a specific problem or question a friend is having.\n\nI understand that it’s the societal norm for humans to seek relationships, so I’m not shocked that my family and acquaintances are always wondering what it is about me, why am I so odd that I wouldn’t want to date. How could I not want to date? I don’t have an answer. I just am what I am. \n\nI have a feeling it’s a mixture of how relaxed and independent I am, and that I’m so comfortable and full on my own that the idea of “finding your other half” is so baffling and unfamiliar to me. Maybe I’ll date in the future, maybe I won’t. My ISFP personality confirms that I don’t worry about the future, and would love for my family and friends to understand that I truly am happy with myself for now. \n\nWould love to know if anyone else feels the same! I’ve searched many times and somehow have not come up with much.
5	I've been in a 4 year relationship and it honestly baffles me how my SO can't stand to be alone at any time, if im ever gone for a night she just goes to her parents, meanwhile if shes gone for a week I love my time to myself. \n\nHonestly half of me feels like im a bad boyfriend for not missing her all the time but I'm way too contempt with being by myself in a lot of situations so I can see how you wouldn't seek out anybody. I never really did because I was always happy doing my own thing but she was pretty relentless in her chase and I eventually caved. \n\nIm sure you will eventually find someone if that's something you decide to do but it will probably be an impulse decision if your anything like me.  
5	I'm  25 now, i always wanted a relationship but never had any, still waiting  for a miracle 
3	I can relate to a lot of that. look up "aromantic" and "single at heart", I think you'll find a lot of interesting reading. 
2	I can relate to you OP. \n\nI'm 20 (male and also ISFP) and while I have dated a handful of times in my life they rarely lasted longer than a couple of weeks. \n\nThey always ended because I would become bored with the individual and did not see the point or reality of a relationship nor felt anything "special" that would mystically attatch myself to them.\n\nI was always curious about relationships and since I am very open minded and easy going, the girls I dated were girls that would actually approach me and be very direct about wanting to be with me so I would accept them to satisfy my curiosities about relationships and to be polite. (I have a hard time saying no and I hate to hurt people's feelings.)\n\nThey would take me places, hold my hand, kiss me, cuddle, all the things you see in those romantic movies but I never felt a thing. It confused me because I am a very emotional person but I was just not engaged in this form of emotion. \n\nIt made me feel like a puppet to be honest and that was uncomfortable for me. \n\nSo I would always break off the relationships the same way by purposely doing things to annoy the person so they would dump me so I wouldn't have to do it myself and hurt them. \n\nLooking back, I think I am the sort of person that has close bonds and affections for people I am directly tied too (familial bonds or close friendships) but the idea of bonds closer than the bonds I have confuse me and I don't feel a need for them. \n\nI'm happy enough to hug my family, spend time with them, hang out with friends and have meaningful conversations but there's no need for affection beyond that I would seek. Romantic affection just seems unnecessary to me.\n\nI feel comfortable in my personal world and to have to make room for someone else would be too invasive for me.\n\nI'll always be content with what I have and I don't see a point in changing. \n
2	Maybe you're aromantic! A quick google would give you more information whan what I have. Best of luck on your path to self discovery :)
2	I can relate to you. I'm in my late 20's and value autonomy and self-independence. But I would not associate this with being an ISFP. Being aromantic or asexual is probably a more accurate reason for feeling this way.

6	Deep Questions	Not.\n\nThere's this girl I'm trying to figure out. I'm very sure she's an Fi dom but not that sure if she's an ISFP or an INFP. So, if you guys would answer these really odd questions that would be real nice of you. It just help me see how you think.\n(Feel free to ask me questions about her too!)\n\n1. What's your opinion on history?\n2. Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic?\n3. Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard?\n4. Do you enjoy talking about your family?\n5. Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions?\n6. What do you think of ENTP's?\n\nThanks for helping me :D\n(Yeah I just copied this from INFP but who cares)
5	Sure I'll answer.\n\n**1. What's your opinion on history?** I like visiting historical sites and museums. Currently taking a United States History class and it is cool, but hard to remember facts. When I visit historical places, I really enjoy looking around and experiencing the site, not as much learning facts about it.\n\n**2. Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic?** I am often sarcastic. Sometimes I am so sarcastic, people think I am being serious (deadpan). Then I have to tell them I am joking and it's not as funny because then it's just a little awkward.\n\n**3. Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard?** I'm not so sure about this one. I suppose so. I have a hard time *starting* tasks. It's hard to give up when you never started in the first place.\n\n**4. Do you enjoy talking about your family?** Also not so sure about this one, since I never really talk about them. I have no issues talking about them. If anyone asks me, I answer honestly. If they ask how my relationship with my sister is, I tell them it wasn't always great but now it's ok. That kind of stuff.\n\n**5. Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions?** I'm very straight forward with my feelings and telling people about them. Not as much opinions, because I don't like putting myself out there. That is because if someone disagrees, I'd have to defend my opinions and that's hard to do, because my opinions are my feelings. Instead of lying (I almost never lie), I just do not disclose my opinion. Usually I either do not have an opinion, or I *say* I do not have an opinion.\n\n**6. What do you think of ENTPs?** I don't know if I've ever met one.\n\nHope I could help you figure out this girl. I had fun answering questions. I had trouble in the beginning deciding if I was an INFP or an ISFP. I ultimately decided I am ISFP because I am very Se.
2	1. History tells you how you got here, the random and not so random events that led to 'now'. It gave me an existential crisis.\n\n2. Yup, sarcasm is fun if its mutually appreciated.\n\n3. If I can go no further then I would give up.\n\n4. I enjoy talking about them (And their mbti types).\n\n5. Yes\n\n6. One of the best people to have along for outdoor activities. And there are no awkward silences! \n\nGood luck with the girl!
2	1. What's your opinion on history?\nIf that makes any sense, I find almost everything interesting to the point that I just really love listening to somebody who knows a lot about the topic at hand. Doesn't mean that I'll remember every fact they told me but if somebody has a unique opinion on something / a special interest in something I'm fascinated and it doesn’t even matter if it has any concrete value what they’re talking about.. I guess that’s why I’m especially fascinated by Ne / Ni doms. Actually for me ENTPs and INTJs are the most fascinating people on earth, I could listen to them for hours.\n\n2. Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic?\nI’m not sarcastic very often because I’m also not the most quick-witted, though I can be sarcastic if in the right mood.\nStill I enjoy sarcastic people a lot.\n\n3. Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard?\nI totally agree with reptasmic on this.\n\n4. Do you enjoy talking about your family?\nYes, but only if asked specific questions (also being honest is very important to me) or if you tell me something I can relate to you’ll get to hear my story too.\n\n5. Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions?\nMy feelings are / Fi is .. confusing, even or especially for myself. I can tell you exactly what I feel at any given moment  (“uncomfortable”, “happy”, “depressed”) and will certainly not lie about it but most of the time I don’t know and hence can’t tell you why I feel a certain way. So if I tell you that I’m in a bad mood but can’t tell you why, it’s better to don’t ask further questions (“was it something at work?” “stress with your parents?”) or – even worse – if you make suggestions / telling me what you think that made me upset and can’t accept if it’s not what you thought  (because if you make a suggestions I will know if what you think feels right or not and most of the time it isn’t).\nMaybe that wouldn’t be your approach at all, just felt the need to add it. One of my closest friends (probably ESFJ or ENFJ) does this all the time and it just stresses me out to the point that I want to punch her in the face though I’m normally the most relaxed person on earth.\nI do like talking about my opinions, if I even have one, and if someone has a “better” one I also easily change my opinions very fast. But this always depends on the topic…\n\n6. What do you think of ENTP's?\nActually I think I’m dating one at the moment, didn’t get him to make the test til now though lol. But as I mentioned above, Ne doms are very fascinating to me and we can talk for hours, both jumping from topic to topic and getting back to the original one whenever it comes back to our mind.. I read in some threads that the ENTP / ISFP pairing can be difficult, but maybe the age gap in my special case also has a positive impact (he’s 34, I’m 21).\nWith him it’s just an easy conversation, though he is talking most of the time, I too can contribute a lot to the conversation and I just feel that he gets what I’m saying and vice versa the same. And I just love listening to him, whatever he talks about I just suck it up like a sponge and ...yeah it just feels soo good being around him from the first moment until now.\n\nEdit - I also love Lip from shameless! :P
2	1. History has never been my thing, but I hear it's because my teachers taught poorly, making us memorize dates and so on.\n\n2. Every once in a while sarcasm is fun, I guess. Not something I freely use in most daily conversations though.\n\n3. Yes, if I feel a problem is no longer worth the time, I'll move on.\n\n4. I'm terrible at talking about my family. I've been married for nearly a year now, and literally yesterday my mother in law had to make sure I *did* in fact have siblings... LOL\n\n5. Yes, I am almost always very honest and straight forward with my feelings. I am way more careful when it comes to stating my opinion. \n\n6. My husband is one :) honestly the healthiest relationship I've been in. We both compliment each other despite our dominant functions being each others' PoLR. 
1	1. What's your opinion on history? It's interesting but I don't seek it out based on my experience with extremely dry history textbooks.\n\n2. Do you feel like it's fulfilling/fun with being sarcastic?\nI am not sarcastic.\n3.Do you often just give up if a problem gets too hard?\nYes\n4. Do you enjoy talking about your family?\nYes, but I'm not going to open up about them easily.\n5. Are you often straight forward when talking about your feelings and opinions?\nNo, sometimes I think out loud with people I am close to. I can say one thing and then by the evening realize that I feel differently. If it's a negative feeling I have a really hard time confronting someone about it. \n6. What do you think of ENTP's?\nI've never met an ENTP, but Lip Gallagher from shameless is apparently one and I like his character despite identifying him as an asshole.
1	1. History: I like learning about people's day to day lives and values from a given period. A lot of times the culture might seem completely alien and fantastical, yet with enough context (history giving us the benefit of hindsight/continuity), it makes sense. What makes it even more interesting is that it was real. On the other hand, it's kind of cool (humbling!) to see how some things haven't changed so much. Still, very interesting.\n2. Sarcasm: I find it fun, but not fulfilling. Because of that, I get tired of it sometimes.\n3. Giving up: No, I hate giving up. If it's difficult it makes me want to try harder. Knowing this about myself makes it hard for me to commit in the first place though. It takes me a long time to let go.\n4. Family: the topic itself is kind of neutral to me. If the person who's asking is someone I like talking to, I can talk with them about anything.\n5. Feelings & opinions: I try very much to be straightforward, but if it's someone who I don't think will respect what I'm about to share, I won't bother.\n6. ENTP: I'm not sure I know any, personally.
3	Do you like reading novels?	Or comics?
3	I love manga. Not too fond of light novels, though. 
2	I love audiobooks. Listening to girl with the dragon tattoo series now.
2	I found a "Choose your own adventure" book on the sidewalk once. It was pretty good.
2	I love comics and manga. Specially manga, could spend a day just reading manga.
2	I can't focus when i read, i always end up on my mind without noticing it, but i would love to read.
2	i used to enjoy reading when i was younger but now i don't use my pastimes for reading at all.. i only read if i am literally bored out of my mind - and at that point i do enjoy a book! and when others are talking about book storylines and all that, i do think it might be fun to read i just never get around to doing it myself lol
1	If they're interesting enough, then yes. Fahrenheit 451 was one of my favorites. I do read comics sometimes too. Although reading isn't really my strong suit, I tend to space out too much when reading something.
1	Yup, novels, plays and audiobooks (librivox is a good audio source for public domain books)\n\nThe Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa is the best feel good novel I've read so far (in my biased opinion, I think its very "ISFP" fiction).\n
1	I like fiction as long as it's relatable to me, otherwise, I struggle getting through the entire book and pick up something else. Coming of age novels are great - they can give me a fresh perspective.
1	I do, though I'm not a great reader. I'm always convinced I can become a better reader by doing it more, but my mind still wanders a lot when I read. I always find it hard to focus entirely on what I'm reading and end up missing things.
7	Real questions right here	
10	Don't know, but I think the lamp got stabbed first
5	Exercise Science, Nutrition, or Interior Design?	Hi all! :)\n\nSo for the past, I don't know, 3 months or so, I've been furiously researching jobs that I might enjoy. As a first-year student at a large public university on a full ride, I was originally going to pursue business, but soon found that was a horrible mismatch. I then focused on actuarial science - but, as an ISFP (MBTI test - Introverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving), I realized this would only be a sustainable career path for at most a year before I got antsy and wanted to do something more creative and "hands-on". Thus, the rapid scramble for major ideas.\n\nSo far, I've got it honed down to interior design, exercise science, and nutrition - these three engage some of my biggest interests, and I would undoubtedly be happy pursuing any one of these fields. However, none of them are particularly known for being lucrative or reliable fields to pursue. Therefore, I just wanted to ask you all, based on my desire for a job that provides a creative outlet, a fair amount of autonomy and stability, and decent pay, which of these paths do you think would be the most beneficial?\n\nSorry about the paragraph, but thank you all so much and any advice helps! A career in writing or art is always a consideration too!
2	I have no clue and now I am confused because I was going to take the Business route... sorry if this was not helpful. Nearly everyone I know is doing something not related to their degree so it may not matter too much... just do the thing you're most interested in.
2	interesting post - I am interested in all of these things(maybe not interior design, but art & design in general). I'm 23 now and have spent a few years on and off at a community college, trying to get an AA degree and study language/linguistics at a university, but I really don't enjoy it and find certain required classes too difficult for me, so I'm going to stop again.\n\nNow I plan on becoming a personal trainer, because I'm interested in exercise & nutrition and find it really fun. I also like helping people and originally wanted to be a foreign language teacher, so being a personal trainer would be sort of similar and feels like it'd have a greater impact on my students. \n\nIf I could go back 4 or 5 years ago, to high school, I would have probably tried to get into an art or design school and not gone to a community college. I just think I'd be a lot happier, even though I'd probably be in debt I might have a job I'd really like, but who knows, I try to not regret things in the past. \n\nFor you I'd just suggest doing whichever one feels the best to you. At the time that was foreign language for me, but I remember friends of mine telling me to pursue art instead and I wish I had done that, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was the right choice. It's hard to say which one to chose - but I think you can have a career using any of those three interests, and even if university doesn't work out for whatever reason you can still pursue them in some form. I don't know how I'll like being a trainer, but I want to be able to move on at some point and work with art as my main focus. 
1	Advertising. That’s what I’m going into. It’s got the creative aspect I need in a job to keep me Intrested
5	What Are Your Thoughts on INTPs?	Hi! :)\n\nMy best friend is an ISFP (pretty sure); I suppose I'd just like some insight into their type. What do you think of INTPs? Where do difficulties/misunderstandings spring up when the two communicate? 
6	I don't really know how to answer these questions since I truly don't believe "an INTP" or "an ISFP" is a solid, empirical thing. However, given my test results as an ISFP and the grouping of people I have met who test as INTP or seem similar (including my mom) then I have some opinions on that schema.\n\nINTPs that I've known fit a few different patterns. On one hand, there are extremely chill INTPs who can appreciate something about me and I can appreciate something about them. Even still, there are (for me) frequent conflicts because I am bad at speaking their language and they are very poor with meeting people at their level or just not acting superior in certain ways. I know it's strange to say about INTPs but they can be very socially elitist and it's even more difficult to challenge because they have already proven in their heads it's the way it should be.\n\nOther INTPs are so far in the stratosphere I have felt we only relate to each other in very unspoken ways. That said, when there is a history or a common interest to bond us, it can feel like we are two lines of an asymptote and the space where we are close to meeting but never really do can feel really beautiful to me- but then, I never know if they feel the same way.\n\nI think there's also a third kind who are just beyond quirky and might even seem a bit insane to other people, like kids in college classes who look like they might talk to themselves in awkward moments or something, but then they speak up and always have something insightful or interesting to say. I always find these people interesting but never actually talk to them and I don't know if they even register my existence.\n\nWealthy science nerd INTPs are basically the noble lords of our day and age and they mostly do their job very well without considering the broader socio-political implications of their output, and have already determined my intelligence and are looking for someone else who understands their brilliance instead of talking to me, but in the politest way possible. \n\nOk, one more. I think there is also a kind of INTP who belongs to a more unique social group or identity and they can adopt ISFP-like aesthetics or interests, but once I try and actually engage in conversation with them I feel like nothing I say relates to their interests. 
4	Because I'm an INTP they're the best types
5	My mom might be an INTP, however I haven't completely figured her out yet. She could be ENTP.\n\nSome misunderstandings we have is that since she's my mom, sometimes I go to her with my problems. She's very good at giving me solutions and an optimistic outlook, but that is not what I want when I talk to her about my problems. I want validation; to hear, "that sucks". Otherwise, we communicate well.
3	I don't know one but they sound incredible :D I think people who have the Ti-Fe axis are adorable; they hide their feelings behind harsh words but they are very loyal to the people who matter and really interesting.\n\nI'd say, since we're pretty sensitive, but tend to hide it VERY well, we can be hard to decipher. Especially when the ISFP has not developped much emotional intelligence just yet. Se-Ni is required to make sense of the world, I think both on people and on ourselves. But then Ti is really good at making sense of things right ? :P\n\nThe difficulties could therefore stem from a lack of sensitivity toward feelings in general from the intp (possibly without knowing where they hit hard), and misunderstandings on the ISFP's part (because of Ter Ni). Fi-Ni makes us sure of ourselves sometimes; but when we're offended, it's due to a lack of self confidence and something we already felt at least somewhat bad about. We tend to beat ourselves up easily because of that inf Te. But we can be easily convinced back with rational argumentation, even if it does not look like it at first.\n\nAn important part might be to not try to manipulate and to stay honest; or else ter Ni might make the ISFP mistrustful. Haha I know much more on the ISFP part than the INTP one. Sorry about that ! Nice to hear you befriended one of us though :)
3	They are very intelligent and seem to have a very thorough understanding of things.\n\nThey are extremely impractical though.
10	Hello everyone i am new	This is a INFJ dropping by to say hello. Someone recommended me to drop by
7	hello. *throws a candy*
4	Hello new and welcome!
3	I validate you 
2	Hey, how's life and stuff?
7	Method of Loci	Have you guys ever heard or tried this memory technique? I highly suspect ISFPs would be good with this [method](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Palace).  Basically you visualize items in a house and you attach a value on it. INTJs can probably use it as well, never worked for me unfortunately. Regardless I'm curious if you can actually use it and if so how far could you push it.\n\nHey, you might wanna look it up, could be useful if you're still in school or need to absorb information weekly.
1	Instead of visualization, I'd think that ISFPs would do better with kinesthetic-style memory techniques. Such as copying down something by writing, doing physical activities, roleplaying even. Some people memorize by mirroring and taking note on body movement. I've recently heard of a method that involves snapping a rubber hand on your wrist during a lecture whenever important information is said. Since no one replied I'm assuming that the method of loci is not prominent in ISFPs, or at least not the ones on this subreddit. I imagine that some ISFPs may be turned off by it since they'd rather root memories in the physical world, videos, writing, etc. Correct me if I'm wrong, ISFPs! On that topic, I've found that some of the ISFPs I know keep diaries because they have things they would like to remember and it may be hard for them to recall their pasts clearly as opposed to, say, ISxJs. Or poetry. I strongly suspect they write poetry in their diaries. Not like they'd ever show me though.
14	Personality and music taste survey -- need some data to back my thesis proposal	hi, anyone you take a quick personality test https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test <-- (don't need to create an account on the site)\nthen take a survey on your music taste? https://goo.gl/forms/lzqPk8jGD6oYXEy22\nWould be huge. Help me get preliminary validation for my hypothesis, hopefully I can post the results later on.\n\n(I know it's not MTBI ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
3	For anyone who hasn’t taken the test yet:  write your scores down.   There are 5 numbers to remember and it’s tough on mobile. 
3	Cool! Let us know if there's any correlation. I'd be surprised if there is, but who knows!\n\nI'm also curious if other ISFP people get similar scores on Big Five. I got:\n\n * Openness 80%\n\n * Conscientiousness 30%\n\n * Extraversion 43%\n\n * Agreeableness 90%\n\n *  Neuroticism 73%\n\nI think it was pretty accurate for me.
4	How could you forgot frickin HEAVY METAL??? It's like one of the biggest genres our there today?
1	You Are Low in Openness to Experience\nYour score for openness was low, at 55%. Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to associate ideas and see relationships between things. Low scorers tend to see things more literally, and focus more on the practical, straightforward, and concrete.\n\nPeople who are low in openness are typically:\n\nPractical\nTraditional\nConventional\nMost comfortable in familiar surroundings\nLow Openness scorers are more likely to be politically conservative and to spend their leisure time enjoying mainstream entertainment, including sports, movies, and pop music. They do not tend to be interested in art and usually avoid high-brow cultural activities like the opera or the ballet.\n\n\nYou Are Low in Conscientiousness\nYour score for conscientiousness was low, at 28%.\n\nConscientiousness describes a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined, and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked.\n\nPeople who are low in Conscientiousness are usually:\n\n \n\nImpulsive\nDisorganized\nSpontaneous\nCarefree\nPeople who are low in Conscientiousness are more likely to develop addictions of all kinds, as they have trouble resisting the impulse to engage in pleasurable activities. They also have more disorganized homes and offices. On the other hand, they tend to be more flexible and spontaneous, and do well in unpredictable environments where they must respond to constantly changing circumstances.\n\n\nYou Are Low in Extraversion\nYour score for Extraversion was low, at 28%.\n\nExtraversion describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others in order to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts tend to conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.\n\nPeople who are low in Extraversion tend to be:\n\nReserved\nIndependent\nQuiet\nDeliberate\nExtraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal, especially a goal that involves other people. People who are high in Extraversion are thrilled by achievements like getting a promotion, landing a new mate, or receiving an award. People who are low in Extraversion do not experience the same “high” from these experiences, and so do not put in as much effort to pursue them.\n\nPeople who are low in Extraversion tend to be fairly independent, and do not need a lot of admiration or recognition from others in order to feel satisfied. They tend not to be interested in money or status, and would rather lead a life that is personally pleasing than one that gains them the attention of others.\n\n\nYou Are Moderate in Agreeableness\nYour score for Agreeableness was moderate, at 60%.\n\nAgreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.\n\nPeople who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.\n\nYour moderate score in Agreeableness indicates that you are fairly typical in the degree to which you balance your own interests with the interests of others. You are probably willing to sacrifice yourself for others some of the time, but you also watch out for yourself quite a bit.\n\n\nYou are Moderate in Neuroticism\nYour score for Neuroticism was moderate, at 45%.\n\nNeuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others.\n\nThis trait can be thought of as an alarm system. People experience negative emotions as a sign that something is wrong in the world. You may be in danger, so you feel fear. Or you may have done something morally wrong, so you feel guilty. However, not everyone has the same reaction to a given situation. High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on.\n\nYour score indicates that you are fairly typical in your tendency to experience negative emotions. You probably feel sadness, worry, anger, and guilt about as much as the average person. You are neither overly reactive, nor especially resistant to the stresses of life.

14	ENTJ here to say thank you	I just wanted to pop in and say that I haven’t meant an ISFP I haven’t liked yet. You guys are awesome.\n\nOur cognitive functions are flipped, which makes you very fascinating to me. I love how you are able to feel deeply and moderate through the complexity. It’s only in the past 5 years or so been able to develop my Fi enough to enjoy the process.\n\nWith that said, I’m curious how many of you are attracted to us ENTJs? I’m not talking just romantically, although it would include that. I’ve found that being around my opposite is pleasantly comforting. You guys have a great way of creating space for others and I feel like you women see right through me, which is refreshingly unnerving. It’s like being stripped of your walls without having to worry about an attack.\n\nAnyhow, I want to thank you for being you and if you have any ENTJ questions, I’d love to answer them.
6	I haven't met an ENTJ yet but going by their online posts I am fascinated and a lil intimidated by them, and I have questions!\n\n1. How do we (err some of us) not grate your nerves?! I am the stereotype artsy-fartsy, unapologetically lazy, hippie-like female ISFP and the day I don't mope in misery over an online argument will be a milestone for me. \n\n2. What are some marked differences between male and female ENTJs, if any?\n\n3. Did your Fi develop naturally with age and experience or did you concentrate effort to improve it?\n\n4. What have you found that you share in common with the ISFPs irl?\n\nThanks! \n\n
5	I think inferior Te would be frustrating for Te dominants, but I think that only applies to less developed ENTJs or ESTJs. To me, it’s both endearing and frustrating. I think it only becomes frustrating for me when I know I can help and the other person is unwilling to accept it.
4	That's cause you're guy and women are expected to be submissive and sensitive.\nISFP males are completely different than females, more so than other types because of Se awareness that Fi is not a masculine trait. Not to sound dramatic but just stating facts. You should rephrase it to "I haven't met an ISFP woman that I haven't liked yet"\n\n
2	Developing your inferior takes a lot of time and energy. I’ll never be as good with Fi like an ISFP, but that isn’t the point. To me, it’s about leverage and stability. Meaning, our dominant and inferior functions are connected. They orbit around each other like two planets. The problem is they dramatically differ in size, so they wobble. Growing my Fi balances out my Te. \n\nI think I would be an ESFP for the day because I would be focused on having so much fun.
1	Thanks for the compliments U.U I don't think I've ever met an entj 
1	Ah, that makes more sense. I think I agree with you. There is more at play than the cognitive types when it comes to personality dynamics. I am only speaking from my personal experience then.  👍🏼
1	Ive met a couple of entjs in real life one male and one female and they were both outspoken, abrasive and high energy. I was attracted to the guy and jealous of the girl and too intimidated to talk to either haha :) anyway im glad you appreciate us isfps though. I often feel like a side character in someone else's story.
1	Ahhh, I'm really late to this post but I'll offer my input and hopefully make a small, helpful contribution! :)\n\nI was attracted to a good friend of mine, an ENTJ, when I was in high school, and I actually posted about him on this subreddit before. He was a natural-born leader, charismatic, and liked sticking up for the "underdogs", I suppose. \n\nOnce I confronted him about my feelings, however, he kind of grew angry with me and insisted I was far too dramatic and emotional. Needless to say, one thing led to another, and I'm not exactly friends with him anymore. \nThis doesn't mean that I hate him at all!! I'll admit it--sometimes, I reminisce about these days and grow a bit bitter; but this is because there was far too much miscommunication between the two of us and, to be quite honest, him and I were far too immature at the time--on my end, due to taking his criticism to heart--on his, misconstruing things I'd said to him as exposing his "weaknesses" to embarrass him or bruise his ego--to understand the benefits of, at the very least, developing a strong friendship or relationship.\n\nDespite all of this, you ENTJs are so awesome and encapsulating to me! You just do what you desire because you know that as long as you have the drive, it's possible!! It's super admirable. :)\n
5	ENTJ need some advice from ISFP females	Hi, I seem to attract ISFP females alot, and I am attracted to them as well, but the thing is, it's hard to get the conversation going. Everytime I meet an ISFP at a party or social setting, it's like oil and fire, I can feel this fire growing inside both of us, but since I don't want to come out as too eager, I do the usual small talk, which usually backfires. You guys literally stare the shit out of me and not say a single word, but your body language and smile tells me you are very interested in me, but I don't know how to get it going in a normal sense. I've slept with ISFP girls before, but it was when we were both high out of our minds either from alcohol or other drugs, and the next morning the same thing happens where the conversation gets kind of frozen and stalemate, and we both end up thinking we made a mistake. ISFP seem to see me as who I am (I look strong and unrelenting, but ISFP sees my soft side) I don't tell my friends that I like dogs, or that I am interested in art and dancing, or that I am secretly a closet nerd, but without a word, ISFP knows that I am that kind of person inside, but the only time I actually open up is when I'm incredibly drunk, which is when the magic happens between me and ISFP.\n\nSo the question is, Is it better for me to completely open up about who I am to an ISFP at first date? I never done it sober, but I would think it would scare them off since no one actually opens up at first few dates (maybe just me). Every type except ISFP, I can follow a routine and get them to like me without opening up. If there is a routine that an ISFP likes, would you guys care to tell me? If not, is taking off my mask and opening up my soft side the only way to get you guys to open up? Me opening up my soft side is equivalent to me kneeling to someone, and my conclusion was that you guys know that. \n\nIf there is a right way to approach ISFP in general, let me know. One of my best friend is an ISFP, and tells me to be straight up and soft, but not really sure what that means and that's the only advice he'll ever give me.
9	As this specific ISFP girl: \n\nI don't like small talk. I'm not good at it and I'm pretty awkward. But if you can get me talking about something I'm interested in like my hobbies, I could go for a long time. Skip the small talk. Get to the real stuff and ask her questions about herself. It helps if you ask questions that cant be answered with just a yes or no. \n\nBut just as a general human tip, it's typically best to be forward to the people you are interested in / friends with about who you are and what you want out of life. It helps relationships go a lot smoother, and you're probably likely to find someone similar to you a little easier.

3	hey i was wondering....	since you guys have se doesnt that mean meditation comes easily to you guys?,since se is all about being one with the moment?whats your experinces of this?,and does living in the moment make you happier?
8	Well personally I suck at meditation. I seriously can't do it for more than a couple seconds. I think meditation is more for the high Ni types who constantly have to worry about everything, and meditation is a way for them to ground in the present. Since ISFPs technically do live in the present all the time, I don't think they need it that much. I could be wrong though... In my case, I live in the moment, but there are times where I just... tune out of the environment into myself. Like when if I'm doodling during a lecture for example. I might look like I'm spaced out, but somehow I'm still aware of what's being spoken about. I'm not sure whether that's Se, or Ni, or a mix of both... \n\nI'm not sure whether being in the moment makes me happier... because 'happier' is still relative to something. 'Happier' to what? Being content could probably be more accurate. I like being in the present, and being appreciative of moments and my surroundings. But at the same time, I also like having goals and having something to strive for, I feel. \n\n^...That ^actually ^kinda ^felt ^good ^to ^write ^out.
6	if i try and properly meditate i find it too hard to stay focused. for my ‘time of peace’ i go on a long solo walk in nature. it allows my body to stay in rhythmic motion, and i can allow myself to get lost in my physical surroundings as i dive into my own thoughts. 
2	Meditation and mindfulness doesn't come easy to anyone, I think. It's something that takes practice to get good at, truthfully. Meditation is a practice that's been super rewarding for me personally.
2	I'm not convinced that having a certain type trait makes anyone naturally better or worse at meditation. When I first tried meditation years ago, I literally couldn't sit alone with my thoughts for even 5 minutes, let alone 1. I remember feeling creeped out just trying to do it. \n\nIn the span of about 3 years, i've finally found my rhythm. I was never consistent with it until now though. I recently challenged myself with a 30 day meditation challenge where I do 15 minutes as soon as I wake up and 15 minutes right before bed. Today is day 8 and just this week alone has been way more valuable towards my meditation "skill" than the sporadic, random meditation days I had in the past 3 years.\n\nLiving in the moment has significantly changed my life and made me happy; along with self love, more importantly. Once you realize that the only moment is NOW and you focus on what the present has, you'll let go of worry, stress, and anything else that can't be changed or benefit you.
2	What’s your type? I think dom-Ni types are actually happier living in the future, dom-se types are happier living in the present, and dom-si types are happier living in the past. Not everyone has to live in the present! Living in the future is actually useful for forward thinkers and people who prefer to make investments and delay gratification! And the good thing is, investing in the future always indirectly makes your present, better!\n\nBut sometimes dom-Ni will get into an Ni-Ti loop and analyse themselves into paralysis, which is perhaps where meditation can come in useful. But I find most times a good conversation with a friend is better for me to get out of my head, than strongwilling myself to do it through sheer force of will. When I’m focusing on someone else, I focus on myself less, and that’s good for me :)
12	Can anyone relate?	I was lying in bed a few weeks ago trying to fall asleep. It was very early (or late I suppose?), about 5:30am. I was in a blank, empty sort of mood. Then I noticed the way the early morning light was coming through my window and curtains, and the type of shadow that it cast on the wall. I felt really uneasy and I realized that for some reason that cold blue light and the shadows on the wall made me feel something very dark and painful. I don't know why but it made think of a girl who had a hard life, suffered a lot, and then committed suicide. This isn't a real girl by the way, the light and shadows just made this story pop into my head. It really made me sad though, I teared up a little thinking about it. I really felt attached to this made up shadow girl so I kind of just lay there feeling gloomy for a while. Then I got up and made a tea and forgot about it.  \n\nThis kind of stuff happens to me all the time, and I don't really mind it. I kind of like it actually, these weird little feelings aren't necessarily negative all the time. Sometimes it's a more happy story or feeling!\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else?
2	If you like writing I would definitely use it as inspiration for piece. Or any art for that matter! 
12	is it me or every isfp description i've read so far has been shallow, poor and completely idiotic	Everytime I read an ISFP descrpition it makes me feel like a retarded monkey who paints all day which I know I'm not cause I'm perfectly capable of logic and abstract thought even more so than some so called "smart" intuitives. \n\nSeems to me that ISFP doesn't get the recognition it deserves and is just taken for granted as some emotional artistic monkey\n\n\n\n
11	Get back in the art dungeon, monkey
6	To be honest, all descriptions in MBTI are, i like the system and is fun and stuff but you can never reflect a human personality into stereotypes
5	My husband is an isfp. He’s the most unique person I know, and we were great friends for ten years before we even dated. Then bam! Soulmates and married. Together as a couple now 4years. He definitely had layers that took a long time to see through, and as a younger guy was just a little too immature in his emotions and perspectives, a little too impulsive. I mistook his argumentativeness/love of debate and stubborn refusal to follow advice as a selfishness and immaturity, and wondered why such an open minded guy could get stuck in his perspective. I had no idea that beneath that was someone who is very capable of understanding anything once he’s not afraid of being mocked/criticized, and is capable of following advice once he starts to see the proof in the pudding.\n\nHe is not an artist but a nurse and previously a medic in National Gaurd (decent at guitar but can’t sing, has eclectic taste in music). He’s also been a bouncer lol. Great at kinetic things like jiu jitsu, and sports. Very tactile and sensory, loves good food, nice sheets, always petting the dogs, exercises, comfortable clothes, aware of his body and things around us. (While I don’t notice my shirt on backwards and often walk into people).\n\nHe is empathetic, kind hearted and supportive. Fiercely loyal. Very individualistic but strives for harmony. Sometimes retreats into periods of hermitude if misunderstood or too much conflict. Rebellious in face of bullies or authoritarians that attempt to control others. Concerned for anyone who is upset, and takes initiative in trying to reassure or help. Hates to see anyone victimized, and defends others.\n\nHas difficulty articulating his emotions well, and does take criticism harshly, even things that are not personal. When criticized he can shut down, divert topic, project, feign ignorance, become stubborn or retreat. He’s actually working on it though, and has grown more self-aware and identifies and handles his emotions much better. Doesn’t mentally spin as much, and starting to notice when he’s drawing inward or closing off. He’s also articulating his perspectives better and getting the bigger picture instead of being derailed by details. Acknowledging passive aggressiveness when it creeps up, and stating himself more directly/holding himself accountable. Sometimes he has difficulty understanding how others perceive things, or predicting how others would react, even though he accepts that everyone follows their own drum and supports it... he can be off mark when it comes to knowing what makes others tick.\n\nHe’s incredibly open minded, very liberal and identifies with anyone who lives life differently. Very alternative in his tastes and interests. He was raised by an INTJ and an INTP, so he does like philosophical debate, and politics, kind of bad at planning and strategy sometimes (might be the ADD lol). He has a lot of INTJ friends who enjoy competing with him, and he seems to lift them up when they go through down times with his positivity/humor/present mindedness. He easily makes friends, and has about 5 best friends he’s kept for over 20 years. I think it’s due to the fact that he is always himself so those who wouldn’t like him don’t bother and those who would like him are drawn to him. Regardless he often says he has social anxiety.\n\nA very poor planner, and so has not achieved all that he wished, prone to feeling overwhelmed with tasks and goals and therefore procrastinates or avoids it, then will slump into inactivity and depression, but then sudden bursts of energy with an unrealistic plan that falls through... and gets him down again. Retreating into long sessions of video games, reading books, binge watching movies when he’s overwhelmed and avoiding. (Again addressing ADD has helped this, as well as using a calender, alarm reminders, and getting feedback on a plan of action).\n\n\n\n
1	yea the descriptions are retarded\n\nhow do you feel about [this](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESI_Profile_by_Gulenko) one
1	I've always liked the video from CelebritytType on youtube
1	i completely agree. a lot of other type descriptions seem to me to be *somewhat* correct (as much as online descriptions can be..), but for isfp it's off by a lot in my opinion.. honestly if it weren't for researching on the functions i would doubt myself being an isfp based on descriptions alone 
1	try the one on Personality Junkie
1	Yes, but in fairness, all of the sensor descriptions tend to run on stale stereotypes. 
1	PersonalityJunkie and TypeInMind are my favorites 
6	Hello, I am new here.	I even just joined Reddit today. \nYesterday, at 31 years of age, I took that Myer-Briggs test for the first time and the result I got seemed just right. \nMaybe it has something to do with why I have been lurking on Reddit for the better part of a year.

4	How do I get you guys to do things?	ENFP dropping by,\n\nI'm in a band with an ISFP (really sweet guy), and he really insists that he doesn't decide what we play and do the decisive things and stuff. But when I try and teach him what to play, correct him whenever he's playing wrong and stuff I can see he dies a bit inside and it hurts me but I can't really let him do his own thing, else he'll just be playing gibberish.\n\nWhat's the best way to get your gears going? I feel like I'm trapping him alot and it's hindering his progress. 
3	The best way, IMO, would be to ask what he wants to play. We thrive on autonomy, being told what to do, and especially how to do it, is stifling.
7	What childhood film do you think shaped your personality?	For me it would have to be "The Sword in the Stone"(1963) and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"(1971). Also Pete's Dragon and most movies from that era.
3	straight up lord of the rings, it was my whole life for my entire childhood
1	I would say [Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3b/Spirit_Stallion_of_the_Cimarron_poster.jpg)\n\nHard to say *how* it shaped my personality, but it was always my favorite movie throughout my childhood. I even had the computer game!
16	The way ISFPs think and carry themselves	Hi friends, back again to throw some ideas around and get a few new outlooks! I've recently come into a relationship with an INTJ who I found to be what seemed a polar opposite, and it really got me thinking about how I process information and problem solve as in ISFP. I often feel as though my mind is blank, and after reading about compatibility between INTJ and ISFP, many explained that we are too happy-go-lucky, fun beings who rarely use logic or reasoning when trying to problem solve. I often feel unintelligent (when with INTJ) and often keep quiet when debating, for I always see both sides to a problem, and also can't come to a side that I could sit and prove to be right, it never seems to be worth my energy. This all being said, I was wondering as an ISFP how you feel your brain works? Are there any tips or tricks anyone has to be more "logical" or change the way you think? To have more "intelligent" conversation, and how to form a strong opinion more often?\n\nEdit: just another question, do any of you feel as though you are too emotional or too deep with your emotions? If not how do you deal with your emotions and process them?\n\n
11	i’ve always felt that this is my biggest ‘downfall’. even when i feel like i’m being intelligent, somebody outsmarts me haha! i’ve found though that instead of trying to seem smarter, i use my ability to see both sides of the situation and offer a ‘devil’s advocate’ type of perspective. keeps the conversation going without me having to mentally strain myself haha. or i just simply admit that i don’t have a clue. 
6	I’m an ISFP, and I’m a 22 year old college student, so speaking from personal experience as an ISFP, we appreciate art in a very concrete and physical way, and we are great creators of organic and natural aesthetically pleasing works of art, but ask us to learn the abstract theory behind that art, and we hate it and struggle with it, unless we see an immediately personal sort of gratification and practical application behind doing so. For instance, I’m an English major, who’s recently seriously been considering dropping the applied music minor I signed up for because I really struggled with learning music theory and keeping up with the introductory Tonal Harmony and Solfegé/Eurythmics courses that I had been taking at the beginning of this fall semester of college before I dropped them because they were just to much trouble trying to keep up with, it felt tedious and stressful trying to do so, as I’ve never played an instrument myself.\n However, I’m a singer and occasional performer, who’s been taking private lessons from classically trained professionals for roughly seven years for my own immediate personal gratification and desire of being able to do something that I already loved to do for fun spontaneously better with more potential to be noticed for it by others. I’ve always learned the music totally through imitation. \nThus, I saw no practical application behind learning anything of music theory beyond the bare basics of being able to read notes and key signatures on a musical staff. I mistook my love for singing and my natural ability to do so well  as something that made me a good candidate for a music minor in college. But it didn’t. Once I got to having to memorize chordal progressions and having to memorize the sound, placement, and intervals between etc. of each note on a piano and a staff, though, I got seriously overwhelmed, and immediately got lost because I saw no practical application to learning to do so.  Thus, I dropped the Tonal Harmony and Solfegé/Eurythmics classes midway through this semester of college, and only kept the Western Music History Survey 1 class because that was straightforward. However, I need the Solfegé/Eurythmics and Tonal Harmony classes for the minor, too, and I refuse to try to take those again, especially since I’m a senior, who’s already going to have to stay at least one extra semester because I’m behind on credits for the minor that the institution I’m attending is forcing me to pursue to graduate (they are making the process of graduating from college so unnecessarily frustrating, and time consuming than it needs to be with this whole minor requirement for graduation bs when it would be as simple as just completing a major and the core liberal arts courses of introductory math,  English, and science requirements at most other liberal arts colleges, and I’m finally tired of learning about all of these additional requirements to graduate from the institution that I’ve been attending for over the past three years now because the dean/administration is clearly money grubbing). \n\nAnyway, I got carried away and went off on a tangent over my personal problems online, which is what FI-dominant users often do when they blog or chat online, or at least I’m an Fi-dom (ISFP), who does, because we don’t often feel comfortable sharing our deeply held personal values, feelings, opinions, and problems face to face with other people directly, unless we are really close to the other person, or we feel like our personal values are being seriously threatened by them. Otherwise, we’re a big mystery to other people, unless we feel a close personal emotional connection to them. Even then, when I’m uncomfortable about talking about my real life personal problems, work, or my future plans for a career and graduating from college, I initially still try to pretend like I’m totally okay and everything’s under control because I’d rather be avoidant, live in my own world on my own terms, be free, be spontaneous, never grow up, focus on fiction, a tv show, a movie, learning to sing a song, or something else totally unrelated because I’m an Ni-tertiary user, so my own real life future makes me feel uncomfortable and insecure whenever I try to face it directly. \n\nThus, whenever I deliberate about my future plans for graduation and a career, even my immediate future, like homework for class on a daily basis a few days ahead of time before they are due, I tend to put it off till the last minute, anyway, gain personal experience that totally changes my perspective and feelings about pursuing said goal, and/or learn about every obstacle that I need to overcome in order to accomplish the goal I want a little too late, I feel bad, impatient, insecure, restricted, and powerless over my own future that every authority figure/superior in my life keeps dictating for me in college. Because it’s not high school, it’s not like I can just let my professors and teachers spoon feed me with help and support that will get me to a clear cut goal that they have for me in their minds  that pretty much secures my future graduation within four years, so long as I play along do homework on a regular basis, and follow their rules, I can also still be able to get away with being spontaneous, carefree, and have time to have fun and relax by just being myself and doing my own thing in my spare time. \n\nMost college professors and advisors don’t do that, though. You are expected to take initiative for yourself, and fulfill their requirements for graduation, though. My college takes it a step further than most, though as a somewhat renowned private liberal arts college in Cleveland with a hefty tuition price by having all these superfluous graduation requirements, making me  jump through all these hoops to get from what I want to be a relatively painless, smooth, swift, and spontaneous point A to point B graduate from my school within less than five years that my college is making more restrictive then I feel is necessary when I simply just want to get through ASAP and get it over with, and needing to look for an internship/future career all make me go into an overwhelming gloom and doom mind state of fears of incompetence, insecurities, and potential failure.  I don’t like dwelling on all that shit, even when I logically know that I HAVE to, so I often have a tendency to avoid it, instead, which can become unhealthy \n\nIt doesn’t mean that Fi-Se/Se-Fi users can’t be emotionally complex and abstract in understanding and exploring their own feelings on paper, or through art, sport, and other activities when they are passionate about someone or something. They are often the most deep, emotionally complex, organically talented, and committed aesthetic  musicians, artists,  and personal experience-based writers and critics. Still, they are concrete creators, who live life one day at a time. They need the immediacy of personal emotional investment, personal gratification, personal connection, positive results, and/or practicality in the application of everything they set out to do. Otherwise,  they tend to struggle and feel bogged down by having to do things that they don’t like doing. They tend to hate learning impractical theory. \nISFPs often tend to get bogged down by college because they aren’t being constantly spoon fed and motivated by their professors and advisors in college with academic support given to students by them, whether they ask for it or not, they aren’t being constantly reminded to do their work on time and keep their academic priorities straight, and because they actually have to tap into their uncomfortable Ni-tert and Te-inferior cognitive function zones that often make them feel insecure, incompetent, and largely powerless in regards to their own futures, so they can fall into avoidance mode and struggle to take initiative by putting up with courses that they are required to take to graduate, even if they don’t like them, planning ahead for their own future major/minor graduation requirements, internships, and career by finding the information needed to do those things out by themselves with no reminders of these obscure pieces of required information just told to you on the first day of classes by your professors and advisors outright because they are inferior Te logic users, especially in regards to doing things that feel like “chores” that they NEED to do, rather than WANT to do. \n\nSFPs are often emotionally complex and wise children their whole lives. They are independent in the sense that they don’t like being bogged down with restrictions and rules that they don’t like, and they often have insightful and mature personal values and opinions about whatever practical subject or talent they happen to feel emotionally invested in and share a personal connection to. However, we also would rather not be adults, do work that we feel no personal emotional investment in, like dull and passionless drones, who work an eight hour job from Monday to Friday really well with no heart, just to pay the bills, and we want to always feel comfortable and leisurely doing whatever we love dancing through life (hey, a Wicked Song reference, but that song is very similar to how SFPs want to live their lives all the time, even though they ultimately never will be able to; they aren’t “brainless,” their personal values and close relationships do matter to them, they are not all shallow, but life is much more “painless” for them whenever they can spontaneously do whatever it is they enjoy freely without being bogged down by fears of the future, or anything that feels like boring work and chores  for them).

2	It just takes time.  ISFP tends to accumulate greater hands-on experience and that can poke a lot of holes in INTJ theorizing.  Logic requires no special skills, only keen observation.\n\nINTJ still see things I don't, their input is valuable, but what seemed so superhuman at the start has been in part made clear to me.  And they have needed to be more emotionally cognizant, too, because the world demanded it of them.  That's how it ends up working.
2	Hey, just visiting these parts for this very reason, trying to get an idea of how my ISFP girlfriend thinks. I often wonder how much I intimidate her out of talking. It's like, on the one hand I know I can't expect to get into the most complex of topics with her, we simply won't share every interest ever. But on the other, I do want her to engage me more with whatever random curiosity she has. A different perspective is still useful even if we seem obstinate at first. I find that INTJs suffer a lack of self-aware emotional variance when considering a stance. That is, we think differently depending on our current emotional state, but we only ever account for our current mindset of the moment. So, it's useful if as an ISFP you can sort of draw out a different emotion from us, perhaps forcibly, just to make us consider a different perspective. 
1	>and often keep quiet when debating, for I always see both sides to a problem\n\nThen why not present it as such? You can outline different perspectives to look at the topic at hand, your opinion, feelings or facts on them, while stating that you're undecided about your final judgement. We like perspectives, we just tend to have strong opinions on them.\n\nI can't speak for others, but there's nothing more unengaging than a person that remains silent all the time, especially when they'd have something to offer/say.
1	I would highly recommend the ISFP podcast by personality hacker. I recently listened and it helped me so much understanding my cognitive functions.
1	I married an INTJ. I've had the same feeling, thoughts and questions you are asking. What I have settled on is that, I'm happiest being my true self and I appreciate my husband for being his true self. I watch, listen and try to understand what and who he is and who I am; I wouldn't try to be more 'intelligent' because it wouldn't be authentic. You don't have to debate with your INTJ to have a meaningful expression of communication. If you don't have a particular opinion on a subject just ask what their thoughts are, they like to go into depth about their passions. Sit back and listen, then ask more questions.  Asking questions shouldn't make you feel less of a person.
1	Eh, why is debating a virtue, and what’s so great about having strong opinions? You sound like you’ve been criticised by someone you respect. I think the best thing about ISFPs is their open-mindedness, and the fact that I can totally be myself around them 24/7 ands it’s all totally OKAY. Don’t ever lose that, and don’t try to be like INTJ!
5	ISTP needs help with ISFP	I have a crush on an ISFP. Possibly ESFP. How do I make it work with her? She is pretty nice and always happy. She always has a smile on her face (not when she's serious though). She likes to see other people's reactions a lot. She's always willing to help and can't turn down a request from someone. She's quite irrational sometimes. \n\nCan you tell me a bit about what you hate about us Ti users and what you people like in a person? \n\nI don't know what else to ask. If you've got experience with an ISTP before, maybe share that. Thanks. \n\nEDIT: After thinking about it and with the help of a commenter, she's an ESFP.
3	She sounds like an ESFP, even in that brief description. My best friend is one and I would say she isn’t too discerning about Ti folks, or anything. As long as you can keep it light with her, she’ll be down for an initial chat. Not to imply lack of substance, but generally a good initial approach is lightheartedness. \n\nYou can also just have a frank conversation with her, regardless of what MBTI she is, about the way your brain works, so she can understand you better. 
1	Yeah, huge difference between ISFP and ESFP
1	ISFPs usually look unemotional from the outside 
6	esfp or isfp	social yet quiet, need alone time but get restless when alone for too long, hates parties but loves getting together with friends, loves attention yet modest, humorous and always wants to be involved, needs affirmation, friendly yet skeptical, impulsive yet careful, hates loud people yet can be loud, loves making people laugh, only serious when in a bad state of mind\n\nhow would you type with this description?
3	i'd say more ESFP. can you elaborate on the "serious when in a bad state of mind" bit, though? that sounds indicitive of inferior Ni or maybe inferior Te.
3	I don't know what I would type this but it fits me very well.
2	99% me_irl, except for the "serious in a bad state of mind" part. There's a line. In normal conversation, I'll usually crack a pun or ten, but will definitely be serious if the situation warrants it.
4	How to pursue an insecure ISFP?	I'm an f/ENTP who is currently pursuing an f/ISFP. She's pretty insecure about herself, and I am pretty confident about myself, how do I make her feel more comfortable with herself and reciprocate my feelings?
5	Time. At least for me that’s how i met my ex at one point. I’m sure it’s not the same for everyone, but just casual everyday talk about personal stuff that’s not too personal? Like get to know them but make it subtle so they don’t realize they gave up that trust for you.
1	I mean you'll have to spend some time with her for this to work... but for me,  it meant so much for my husband (boyfriend at the time. lol)   to see all my "flaws" and the bad parts of myself that I normally hide or feel insecure about... for him to see those and still just love me all the more and kind of shrug like none of those things could ever be a deal breaker anyways.   He has always made me feel loved unconditionally. 
1	DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH HER\n\nBe nice to her and earn her trust until she's comfortable with you and knows you care about and VALUE her feelings.  Then you can work on helping her fight her insecurities.  Essentially what I would recommend is to nurture her in such a way that she is free to express her feelings without judgement.  That is very empowering for the ISFP.  Help her find her place and her role within the world, and she will be content there.  
5	we should have a group chat	hey guys if there isn't one already we should really make one
5	no one would show up
1	I made a ISFP Discord server a few months back, maybe this'll interest you? :)\nhttps://discord.gg/uymZnN8
5	What do you think of self-deprecating humor?	For some reason it always pisses me off. 
8	I’m weird about it. I have no problem doing it to myself, but I don’t like it when others do it. I have no clue why I’m that way, I just am.
2	it's mostly super annoying
1	It's good - but do not be so mean to yourself. I just try to not take myself seriously
1	I do it all the time.\n\nIn a time like this where everything seems to be taken seriously, it's relieving for me to not always take myself so serious.
1	i do it all the time\ni find it slightly upsetting when others do it tho
1	I mostly enjoy it, but there are times when some people do it in a way that makes them seem like they just want attention and are not actually joking.
1	I use it a lot.  I suck.  It helps me feel at ease with my shortcomings and insecurities.. by sacrificing myself to bring a little bit of laughter to others.  Also it allows me to maintain a state of comfortably low self esteem, wherein I never disappoint myself because I don't intend on making anything of myself.  But at the same time it's not like I'm hurting anyone or bringing anyone else down in the process, so it's all good.
1	I do it but I hate myself. I think it’s easier to do it to myself then to have others do it to me first. I think it can be a sign of deeper issues. For example I was abused as a child by my family and bullied growing up. 
5	Do you tend to be contrarian or go against the stream?	For example, let's say a bunch of people on the Internet are talking about how amazing a song is. I automatically want to dislike it. Conversely, when someone hates something, I often want to like it. Not sure why, though. 
3	I'll take a stab at the "why"\n\nI think we live by our own timelines which does not always move parallel to the pop culture timeline i.e. we're more likely to be influenced by our moods or our personal tastes at the time than a less personal* influencer like pop culture trends. \n\n\n\n\n
2	If i do something and it becomes popular among people i start to hate it and i end up not doing it anymore(clothing for example), that looks pretty hipstery but i don't think i am.\nEdit: i also don't like trends, like these retard challenges or games like happened with Pokemon GO.
2	If something seems inauthentic to an Fi user, they will hate it.  It could be that you find pop culture inauthentic.  Alternatively it could be an Enneagram 4 thing, where you simply want to differentiate yourself from everyone else.  There are quite a few ISFPs who are also Enneagram 4s
1	i’ve missed out on so many good things because the hype turns me away. except bodak yellow. i bump that shit every morning. 
1	I find this inner turmoil of both quite often. 
1	both. but yeah, especially if it's something people are hyping up it'll probably take me a while to check whatever it is out just cuz. lol.
4	Ni-Te under stress?	Do you find yourself finding practical solutions under stress that you wouldn't have found otherwise? \n\nExample:\n\nToday I had bought a train ticket to my hometown (I study in another city). Before I left, I recalled that my mother had asked me to bring her glasses and my little brother's coat that they forgot at my sister's place, which is located in another district of the same city.\n\n As I was leaving, I calculated the time that it would take me to take the forgotten things from my sister's place and from there, to the railway station. Well, it wasn't enough so I decided to change the ticket to another one that was 2 hours later (with a small fee). I went back home, ate a bit (I was hungry and I forgot to take some food with me.) I decided to take my time with it. \n\nWhen I was ready to leave the second time, I calculated the time again (with a navigator app, I find it pretty reliable), and I found that I wouldn't make it yet again (or I would miss with a few minutes). Then I realized, I could message my sister to ask her to bring the things to the railway station herself! Then it would save me considerable time that way and I wouldn't have to panic. So I did. Thoughts? Have you noticed something like this about yourself (in stress situations) as well? I know we ISFPs are usually spontaneous and in the moment, sometimes without planning things that well, but I think we can sometimes find practical solutions out of nowhere when being under enough stress. 
6	yep i can relate almost exactly xD  i just start looking for all the solutions when i'm stressed to find a practical one.
6	What does it say?	So, I initially mistyped myself and thought I might be INFP, until I went over to the INFP reddit. After a day or two I realized I wasn’t like these other people and did more research to discover I was definitely an ISFP. \n\nHowever, they have a huge community over there, and a well organized forum. What does that say about us? Is it indicative of our personality type that we haven’t formed a more robust and well defined community?\n\nOr is it simply that intuitives are only 25% of the population and an online forum is a great rallying point, particularly for the kinds of folks that INFPs are. \n
3	IIRC INFP tends to be one of the most frequent mistypes, so I'm sure most of the people there aren't actually INFPs. Not sure why our community is so small, though.
3	Skilled Trades	Ready to leave my sales job. I’ve held a majority sales positions for most my life. I think the performance or artistic side has allowed me to be successful. But the authenticity, and introversion side of me absolutely hates it. I also really crave more stability than sales provided. \n\nCurious if any ISFPs here are in a skilled trade of some sort? If so, what do you do?
1	Yes, mixing music, yadda yadda.\n\nI seriously don't understand how you did sales for so long.  That's one of the worst jobs I've ever had.
1	My first sales job was as a banker with Wells Fargo. I lasted 6 months before I quit. That was awful, the pressue the micro management for sales was awful. \n\nI always had my mother and immediately family behind me telling me I’d be an awesome salesperson since I can connect with people and can be so animated. \n\nMy second go around was as a real estate agent. I’ve last longer at this because I’m self employed so there isn’t the micro management. There are times it’s less “salesey” but at the core of it, is trying to sell yourself and getting people to commit to work with me. I can’t stand that aspect. Plus the lack of stability in income has done nothing but drive me bat shot crazy. With a wife and three kids, I can’t take it and I want to do something this time that is more in line with myself. 
2	Do you wish you were another type?	I keep wishing I was an ENxx. I feel it would make my life easier.
10	I do. The stereotypes and social norms that we are held to today do not really make it easy. I am an ISFP Male and really hate how men are supposed to be tough, confident, and the go-getters in a relationship when we as ISFPs are not those type of people. Although I do appreciate my personality type because I am able to easily empathize with others, there are simply many other things that I wish I could improve on. If anything, I wish I could be an ESFP so that I can still maintain the qualities of an ISFP without necessary tiring out after a long day of social interaction.
7	I did before I found my career.\n\nSociety can be...  Unappreciative of certain type traits (note I did not say types specifically).  The truth is that, yes, it's unfair.  It overvalues some traits which comes easy to certain types over others.  You say that's ENXX but I'd side more towards ESTX.\n\nISFPs can make considerable contributions towards culture, and without that society dies.  The heart surgeon does not do surgeries 24/7.  They listen to music, they watch movies, they read.  They absorb.  Our type is usually less involved with creating structure and more with giving context.
2	Not really, I actually feel somewhat proud to be ISFP for some reason. 
1	Well. To be honest, I'm not very aware of most other types. But since my life's (seemingly unrealistic) dream has been to become a musician full time, I find it very encouraging that ISFP is the type most aligned with my dream. Wouldn't want to be anything else just because of this little encouraging thing, to be honest!
1	I’d want to be an ENFP cause their lives always seem so exciting.. but at the same time, I like being an introvert way too much so maybe an INFx.. I really just wish I were an N type heh But I don’t dislike being an ISFP either. In fact, I like it more than I dislike it. It’s my mental state that I have problems with 
5	How do you deal with guilt?	Its one emotion I wish could fast forward through. 
4	Really depends on why I feel guilty. Was it something I needed to do in order to protect my mental health? Or did I behave like a douche? Both can make me feel guilty equally.\n\nSo yeah, in the second case I have the opportunity to learn from it. I can reflect on my behaviour and try to forgive myself because I probably had reasons why I acted the way I did. I know that I can learn from mistakes and that is truly a gift, imo. So in the end I can turn it around and be glad to have something I can use to change.
3	no matter the situation i just try to acknowledge how i'm feeling/what happened and accept it. i remind myself that there's nothing i can do about the past, but that i *can* do something about my present and future - change. really, i try not to overthink it. it doesn't do me any good. it takes practice though, it isn't easy. 
1	Guilt is useless. It activates the reward center of our brain so it makes us feel like we're doing something to fix the situation, but we're just making it worse. I try to focus my energy on actually fixing it, or if there's nothing more I can do, learning from this experience to avoid making the same mistake again.
5	How you guys handle the stress?	So, I've been lately stressing over small and big things, even if they are not concerned to me directly. This is SERIOUSLY having effects on my health. I stay every time anxious or nervous, my blood pressure is always low, I have bad headaches for days, I can't sleep ( thing that I never ever ever had problem, I just faint on any place when I am tired ), I can't concentrate, I just wanna cry sometimes, I think over and over what I did wrong / if it's my fault, my heart sometimes hurts. This is driving me crazy! I just want some help from you guys.
5	Meditation, i can't stress this enough.\nEven 20 minutes makes a big change to me
3	Working out with a personal trainer, riding my bike, and eating better has helped me. I still have nights where I just can't fall asleep because of stress or sadness (don't know whether I'd call it full-on depression), but I fall asleep easier now that I'm exhausted from working out. I try to remember that all good things in life take time, work, and plenty of effort. Whether it's developing true close friendships (takes years), finishing out college (also takes years if you're not sure what direction to take, or you're working full-time), or even working on a project that you thought would take way less time and money.
2	How about walks on the beach or any quiet, calming space? I would suggest a hike too, if possible. 
2	Drink some water with salt in it, you could be low on salt. Weird I know but I get the same thing sometimes and salt helps a lot.
1	I smoke weed and make sure to express myself through an artistic medium everyday. Meditation will also help tremendously.  
1	[deleted]
1	Have you seen a therapist? Stress and anxiety can really ruin your health. I also recommend trying different forms of meditation. My favorite is just sitting down and focusing on my breath. Got distracted, no problem, go back to it, breathe in, breathe out. But there are many other forms, really, all meditation does is make you focus on the present moment, which is all that we have. The past is gone, and the future is uncertain.\n\nAlso, since you said you worry about issues that aren't yours, I recommend this article: https://markmanson.net/boundaries
5	Do you confess to your crush or just wait?	I am an isfp girl. A year ago I tried to confess to my crush through WhatsApp and he thought it was a dare. then I was too nervous that I changed the topic. actually I knew it was not going to work but I tried anyway. this confession was the last straw before ending the friendship and my feelings towards him. at the end nothing happened and I gave up. :( \n\nheres the question: do you isfps confess your feelings or do you bottle them up and observe?
8	i'm a girl & you know - the social norm is that guys are supposed to make the first move, which is crazy and a whole other topic itself.. but putting all things aside... generally i just bottle up and observe, i don't usually say anything unless i have a feeling that it's mutual (not that i've even ever *truly* confessed anyways...) .\nbut really, that's me with every relationship whether it's platonic or romantic. i don't really put myself out there unless i can kinda sense that the other person wants the same thing as i do. and even then i would be hesitant to do anything about it.. but when i do, things are usually just more on the subtle side, haha.
7	I've bottled up feelings and I've let them flow\nIn the end you won't know if feelings are mutual without asking.\nIf you think you feel good about someone it won't hurt (long) to ask.\nPeople usually won't hurt your honest feelings and if they did you know right away you'd be better off alone or someone else.\n\nYour feelings come from thinking about him or her and if they haven't thought about you like you have thought about them then there's only one way to get them thinking like you.\n\nBottled up feelings only hurt or please you, nobody else.\nSharing them includes others.\n\nFollow your heart with a hint of thought.\n
6	I usually wait for them to pass.
4	I'm an Isfp guy, and I'm honestly to scared to make a move, because I feel like a look to far into things, or just miss hints in general
3	I never confess anymore. When I do it always backfires.
3	I don't bottle it up lol. I wait it out, keep meeting new people, let go of attachment, keep trying to meet them if they like hanging out with me, keep flirting, keep it light and friendly, if they show any signs of interest, I move in, if not, I just enjoy the time with them for what it is.
2	I never pursue my crushes.  
1	I'm no expert on this, but depends on how long. If you know them a decint amount then tell them, but in person. Always in person!!! It makes it more genuine. I am guy and I like when girls make a move. I find I've shot myself in the foot by waiting. I'm not great at it, but it's better to try and miss than never take a shot. I regret not doing far more. Remember it is at the worst practice. 
1	All my instances of confession have been hopeless "getting it out of my chest" moments, mostly. I'm awful at that kinda stuff.
1	Bottle them up. Unless I know for sure that the feelings are mutual. Except I remember one year, now that I look back on it, this guy was being very obvious that he liked me and I was torturing myself trying to figure out if he had a crush on me. He ended up losing interest and so did I. Don’t do what I did. 
1	I'm too shy to make a move directly, but if I'm really into that person I try to take a chance, even if it's asking a mutual friend if they seem interested or not. Whatever works for you. Also, passion (being "in love") isn't a very healthy thing for me, it usually happens when I'm idealizing someone, not seeing them for who they really are. Real love is being partners, building something together, and that's more important than random unrequited crushes
1	Hell no
4	what does your instagram feed look like?	i've seen something like this on the mbti sub (which was very generic & general lol) but i guess i just want to know what my fellow ISFPs instagram feeds look like. if you post at all, anyway xD\nmine consists of:\n-scenery & nature\n-food\n-animals\n-pics with friends\n\nand no selfies...\n\n\nwhat about you guys?
7	Don't have a Instagram. Got rid of it long time ago, friend.
3	[Mostly animals so far](https://www.instagram.com/xheylaura/) but I'm probably going to change it up a bit.\n\nHonestly I kind of hate the Instagram culture though.
2	Mine is mostly all pics of my cats, and some scenery/nature photos. I sometimes post pics of my niece and baby brother, but just like you...never selfies. 
2	Scenery, baseball games, concerts, alcohol, family and the occasional OC meme
2	Nature and art 
2	scenery, photos with siblings/cousins, cars
2	mostly my pets and scenery or pictures with my friends. pretty much same as other is fps lol
2	I struggled for a bit to really like Instagram. I too thought it was superficial and surface level based. Just a matter of finding pages we feel for I guess! 
2	Some amateur [smartphone photography](https://www.instagram.com/sepalfi_x3/). Not long until I can afford an actual camera, aka proper equipment. So excited! x3
2	literally nothing.  I havent posted anything, I just have an account so that i can stalk other people. lol!
2	Mostly plants
1	Hm, [Mine](https://instagram.com/clockthatmelts) has most hooping videos, travels, and my cooking/baking. I very rarely ever post selfies. As an artist and former photographer, I do like to try to play photographer take creative photos haha.
1	ART
1	It's highly dominated by food photos. There are also some pics of sceneries, exhibitions, seasonal decorations, the neighbourhood stray cat(s), and a few pics of my dolls before I decided to make them their own account.
10	Introspective Ramble	I have a lot of fragmented thoughts that fly in different directions. They’re rarely narrative in structure… which would flow like a journey towards an end goal.\n\nI wish I knew why\n\nOne of my theories is that I’m bombarded with sensations which narrows my scope of attention. Sometimes I get so focused on the micro details of the situation that I lose sight of the bigger picture. A minute ago I spent about 30 seconds re writing the word “they’re”; something about the conjunction was bothering me. But merely the process of deleting and re-writing that sentence was almost just as captivating as the intention I had to begin writing this. \n\nIt’s why I have such a hard time sticking to things long term. It’s so easy to get lost in the moment. \n\nIs it something I can control? Yeah, with a lot of effort. Do I wish I was different? I guess, but wishing that doesn’t change the reality. Am I just lacking a long term goal which is important to me? Perhaps, but I haven’t been able to construct a sustainable goal that extends far into the future. Or maybe my idea of a goal needs to be less objective and more subjective…\n\nBecause every time I conceptualize what I seriously want to have accomplished on my deathbed, it’s less about the accolades and more about the person I became throughout the process. \n\nI admire people not for their material achievements, but for their personality and values. How authentic was this person in expressing what they truly felt? Whether it was “right or wrong” is less important than sloppily expressing your personal truths. Obviously we’re all constrained by the environment we’re in… we sacrifice our authenticity to maintain order in the social realm. I wouldn’t joke around in a sexual way in my corporate job nor would I have an unfiltered laugh at a friend’s funeral for some selfish reason. \n\nBut for some reason this personality trait: authenticity, or congruence, or alignment with thoughts and actions in a genuine way, is what I’m powerfully drawn to, both in myself and others. Again and again, it appears to be the highest virtue I strive for. And the more my attention is focused on authenticity, the more trivial other things become.  Petty insecurities like how others perceive me become completely subordinate to my pursuit of authentic expression.\n\nIt’s why I respect things like spirituality and religion. Though they’re not the only mechanisms of inducing a purpose filled life, they limit your focus of attention towards what’s the most important. I read a book about how the most happy people are the least focused on being happy, the successful companies aren’t the most focused on profit, and the most creative people don't force themselves to be creative. It’s as if these achievements and skills arise in an oblique way, indirect rather than direct. And yet these achievements are often percieved to be the result of deliberate systematic technique, it appears they arise as a mere side effect of something more important.\n\nWhile this doesn’t extrapolate much about my original point, I think you can see how my thoughts become scattered. I go down vortex’s of thought… building and building on an idea as the sensations captivate me through time. But maybe I can string an idea together…\n\nI originally criticized myself for how shortsighted my attention and focus was. But what if that's a mere side effect of authenticity?\n\n...Because how could authenticity be conceptualized in the future, when the very definition of authenticity is ACTING in alignment with your thoughts and feelings? One cannot ACT in the future. So by definition, my highest virtue requires immediate action to feedback whether I’m being authentic. So my own critique of being shortsighted and bombarded by emotions is perpetuated by my striving to act authentically in the moment. Perhaps, a more sophisticated goal would could be to be as congruent as possible for the longest amount of time; strive for the state of being authentic, and every material accolade and success would arise indirectly.\n\nAnd that goal feels right to me. \n\nUntil it doesn't.
3	As a type we're known for not planning far into the future, and personally I prefer it that way. I like having my options and don't mind living on impulse, it has never bothered me in the past but I acknowledge that it does not always benefit me especially if I'm working towards a deadline. I find myself at the mercy of my very fickle motivation and everything from the environment to nagging questions in my head distract me while working (I currently do freelance but I plan to switch to a day job soon and see how that works for me) As much I hate it I need to discipline myself a bit :(\n\nMy point is, if it doesn't affect the quality of your work or your goals then there's really no problem in being authentic and living in the moment :)
3	I appreciated what you had to say. Can 100% relate. Shits deep man 
3	I'll preface this by saying I'm an INFJ and I've been crushing on an ISFP for 3 months (browsing this sub for a week), and I think this was the last piece of the puzzle that helped me 110% understand her. \n\nShe's interested in me because we worked together (catering) and I was 100% myself around everyone. I've been depressed for 10 straight years, and only recently truly started coming out of it last year (just before I met her). I stopped worrying about how people close to me would see me and I just opened up and was completely myself, and it wasn't as bad I'd always thought. People actually liked me better, when I got outside of my head and just really acted like myself. I'm thinking this and 100% confidence in my decision-making skills is what she saw in me. \n\nIf you'll allow me to parallel her and yourself, I would say that she really needs to remind herself to take care of herself and following through with her little hobbies she has, like knitting or watching netflix. But, she feels like that's a waste of time, so she always prefers to be in-the-moment and is hanging out with her friends all the time, but rarely lets herself cut loose and enjoy herself when she's alone and forgets to take care of herself --- in that, she needs to follow through with her hobbies because she chose them for the exact right reasons, but doesn't follow through with them on an everyday/cathartic-basis because she feels like it's not 'productive' or 'conducive' enough for a future, even though those hobbies are the only things that can really take her mind off of herself. \n\nI would say, the short-attention span is great, because you're always in the moment, but the thing is, you definitely overlook how therapeutic a hobby could be; it's not natural for you guys, but you have to consciously and actively let yourselves relax on a regular basis. Because, the thing is, your hobbies ARE your authentic self, but you keep stressing about "more important" things you should be doing than letting yourself breathe and enjoy whatever your hobby is. \n\nHow does that sound?
2	Are you actually working a corporate job, or were you expressing your point? If you are, it sounds like you should leave corporate behind, it sounds like you need to go do you.\n\nIf you were just looking to express yourself here then know someone read this and appreciates it.
2	Pretty much my life up to this point. I took a job for the mere point that I’d be able to make great money and be independent. I had some success, but you mentioned religion and spirituality. I would consider myself to be a conservative Christian. \n\nThe fact that what had to motivate me to get up each day, and do the things I didn’t want to do (make sales calls, knock doors, etc) was not only incongruent with my own personality, but also didn’t feel to authentically align with my faith. My focus was upon gaining more material thing, greater financial success, not providing for the less fortunate and giving away what I don’t need. Don’t get me wrong, I was generous, but to force myself to do the things I didn’t want to do and were what I now know incongruent with my personality I didn’t have this alignment of belief and action, and it bothered me tremendously. \n\nI remembered I would seek counsel from people and try to articulate how I felt like I had to worship money to be able to do my chosen line of work. Often times the folks would give me advice like “do it to help people” or “focus on doing it as though the work is on behalf of God”. Which in theory is great and all, but what I’ve come to realize only in the last month is that my work is truly incongruent to its core as to who I am and this is why I struggle so immensely. \n\nIt’s tough because I feel like we live in a ENTJ or ESTP kind of world, and I had learned to modify my external behavior to mimic these traits, and ultimately it just wasn’t who I was, although we normally all have *some traits* of the opposite personalities. \n\nAnyway, looks like I might have just rambled. This might have been more for me, than you, but your post helped me realize some of these things. Thanks, and I absolutely identify with your struggle.

The admin loves IxFx types, and so the server has a higher proportion of introverts and feelers compared to other typology servers. That being said, it's an inclusive community and all types are welcome, so feel free to join even if you aren't an introvert or a feeler.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Tsg4sUd
2	Do/did ISFPs like math in school?	Share your experiences.
7	Loved Math, it was one of the few classes I could easily pick up. That and physics which is just math science. Math has always been easy to me but I'm not really sure if that's a personality thing. I'm pretty skeptical when it comes to thinking of a certain personality types strengths in school. (I suck at art and I'm not creative)  
4	I dreaded maths. 
3	Fuck. No.
3	i did like math and was pretty good at it. later on though i realized i wasn't really good at it unless i had guidance so i kinda lost joy in it xD 
3	I liked math when I already knew the theory and you just had to solve a problem and you felt like a detective. It was so fulfilling.\n\nWhat I absolutely hated was studying the theory with 100 phrases to explain one thing that is obvious
1	I was good at math, but didn't really liked it. But if i felt challenged by an exercise, then i became scompletely foccused into it.
1	Math was a guaranteed A
1	solving equations is fun :D
1	Yep I'm majoring in it now 2nd year
1	loved math, esp trig, hated stats
1	Cake walk. Are you kidding? 😉
1	Sort of. I kinda liked it but was bad at it at the same time. I was bad at paying attention to it, I guess that's more accurate.
1	It was boring and astoundingly rote.  Also very restrictive - something which would not appeal to this type.\n\nThink about it.  English: here's some rules, here's a subject, go write a few pages.\n\nMath: do these 100 problems by tomorrow.  They're solved in one of these three ways: ___________\n\nI could understand limited appeal but the repetition really grates on you by the time college comes around.
1	Not a single bit. I was more of a English/art guy.
1	Nope, not at all. The one exception to this was Physics- I really liked that for some reason. My best classes were English and History 
1	My favorite classes are the math, science, and computer science courses. Art is probably my least favorite because I can’t draw what my brain imagines, my hands won’t allow it. I know good art when I see it, I just can’t create it. 
8	ISFP Computer Science	Any ISFP in computer science?\n\nMind sharing your experience or if you have any tips them too,cheers!
6	Sup, i'm graduating this semester and i already work at it.\nIt was really hard when i started, maths was a nightmare. Everyone says ISFP is bad for this type of stuff but i really think that putting some effort into it you can do anything and at some point be better than others.\n\nLet's say, it was hard to me to start and understand new things, but now that i know all that i mastered all the basics i'm pretty good at it, i'm one of the highest notes of my class.\n\nSorry for the poor english
3	Still haven't gotten to actually take a programming class (going back to school) but I do love me some computers so I'll let you know in a couple of years lol. Good luck fellow ISFP computer sciencey person 
2	I am 17 but I love programming. Doing websites for some time now, few years and it is great. You listen to your music while your brain is @100% thinking, imagining what is actually happening, learning. You can be some-way-creative in your code, there are plenty ways how to do specific thing. Your apps can be small in code and great meaning some people can appreciate your work you are doing. You can apply your \~\~aesthetics\~\~ in UI design. Only "hobby" where I found my [flow](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/group-flow.png).\n\n\nThis year I am taking computing technologies class - C and fundamentals. Greatest thing for me is that you do not have to hard-learn a lot of things, mostly it is just common sense, logic and a fuckton of Google :-)
1	I'm an ISFP, and am quite interested in computer science.\n\nCurrently planning to study computer science in college, likely going to focus more on the cybersecurity and/or programming side of things.\n\nI've done great in CS related classes, I guess I'm just naturally skilled at that sort of stuff.
1	Computer Science was my intended major for a while in undergrad. It's what my brother did and I liked a lot of similar things so I figured I would give it a shot.\n\nThe positives for me where that I really really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. There was a big thrill around working out a bug that I'd been tracking and working on for hours and finally having everything compile appropriately, and I wasn't used to feeling this sense of accomplishment after finishing an assignment in other subjects. I also loved learning the basic principles behind computer logic, encryption, network connections, etc, these were things that I wondered about, but didn't know how to start learning about them. I don't know much, but it satisfied my curiosity. The final thing that made it enjoyable was that I like learning languages, and about how they work. I'm no pro at learning to speak a foreign language, but I always had a thing for linguistics and picking up small details and common traits, and I liked comparing what I knew about human languages to that which speaks to machines. Again, I'm not great at any of this, but I'm describing what I liked.\n\nThe downside was that none of it was intuitive to me. I'm an extremely visual and hands on learner, and it was very difficult for me to figure out the math behind it, as well as picturing abstract concepts that are so necessary all around, such as in how the data is stored, how the language communicates to the OS or whatever at lower levels than what I worked with, etc. I ended up having to stalk my Uni for empty classrooms so I could try to draw out my entire program across the chalk boards as I was writing it so I wouldn't get lost. The most difficult part for me came later when they introduced us to GUIs. Being so visual and yet failing so hard at making a visual interface for my program was the most frustrating thing I have experienced in a course.\n\nYmmv of course, but this was my experience. So while I do not regret taking all those courses thanks to those positive things I did learn, overall I did not enjoy it. I ended up finishing my school in another direction after a while because I simply could not continue
1	I’m working towards a BS in information systems which involves minimal programming but I hope to get into programming as a career. Might pick up the CS minor as well but not too sure yet
1	I'm ISFP borderline ISTP.  I started out in Electrical Enginnering, spent almost 4 years there before switching to CS.  Finally graduated after 8 years total in school.  Been in the industry for around 10 years now.  It's great, I love what I do. \n\nMath was never a problem for me, but calc 2 pushed me beyond what was enjoyable.  Core CS classes were great as long as I got good teachers who didn't micromanage.  Some of the generals were a drag (ethics, technical writing) but some were quite interesting (geology, psychology).\n\nToday I'm a backend developer.  I mostly write APIs.  I used to say, "My apps are like my woodworking, ugly but very functional".  But I don't believe that's true anymore.  I really enjoy writing a 'beautiful' well documented API, and I am putting an absurd number of hours into a beautiful new herringbone kitchen table. 
1	I’m majoring in computer science, and I love it. I took computer science for three years in high school and now this is my second semester taking it in college. To me, Computer Science is my way of expressing myself because I have complete control over what happens in the program. I know it can’t do what I don’t tell it to do, and it becomes fun when I try to figure out where I told it the wrong thing to do. 
8	Songs that you find great but seems like no one knows about them ?	hey guys,\n\nso, as the title says, do you have any songs that you find great but seems like no one knows about them ?\n\nIt is hard to find those songs because well, youtube autoplay always eventually ends up at pop songs (ehm, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift), aswell as spotify (except this ends up with popular songs for the genre you are listening to).\n\nFor me, it would be [LP - Lost on You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3wJ1_1Zsg) (I know it has got like a fuckton of views, but hhey i didn't know about this song for so long)\n\nPS : I think the best ones are those which when you listen to them, you are like "ehh I dont know.." but when you play it two more times you can't stop listening to them :-)\n\nEDIT: no problem with playlists too, or even whole genres ! I mean, f.e Electro swing, It's great
3	Ben Howard - Oats in the water\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaH4W1rY9us

1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnkorLFygvE\n\nLove this band so much..
1	Anything from The Birthday Massacre (goth/alternative rock) or Aural Vampire(darkwave/industrial). There are lots of great songs on both of them, and both are great bands, but I have met only one person beside me who knew of Aural Vampire and none who knew TBM prior me introducing it to them.

1	[Atlas Genius - Don't Make A Scene](https://youtu.be/5TaCtE4oG5E) \n\nThere's so many great songs on this album that I like and only really one (Trojans) that's well known
1	Pretty much anything on Mucc's Gokusai album. Especially [Panorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AcJpYBIboM) and [Yasashii Uta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPqdvhHgErQ).

7	What are your creative outlets? Hoping to find a new one for my ISFP sister. Currently she likes making braided bracelets, poetry and prose, and drums and guitar.	
3	I play video games, color, and I do something called bullet journalling. It's a creative outlet for you to do so many things. 
2	Music!! See if she is into mixing audio? That's very interactive and creative. She already can play so shouldn't be a stretch. Painting also, goes hand in hand with music and poetry. If she likes making bracelets try buying her a bead set for the like. And lastly I'll suggest gardening, I've found this to be a fantastic outlet for creativity. 
1	I've always enjoyed video games which has turned into building my own computer to play, I play a bunch of instruments but my go to activity if I'm not being an adult is video games. Hope that helps 
1	I crochet, play pc games, write stories, working on doing woodworking, and I love cooking. 
1	Singing and blogging. I don't really journal, unless I really need to talk to someone.
1	Photography and digital art 
1	Wheel throwing!  It's the form of pottery where you mold the clay with a spinning wheel. It's so so so fun once you get the hang of it. I like that it can be so many things. You can do it solo, you can do it with other people and be social, it can be really therapeutic/meditative too, and last but not least it's super creative. Even after you create what you've created from just the wheel spinning, you still gotta trim it up and paint it. I would absolutely encourage anyone try it out if you don't mind getting a little messy with your hands!
1	Poetry, beatboxing, dancing, singing, painting 
6	What is a beautiful person to you? How do you define beauty in a person?	
12	Those who can evaluate situational outcomes to not only benefit themselves but also others. Also anyone that knows to put the toilet paper flap in the front gets about half my trust off the bat.
5	Sincerity, authenticity. Someone who knows their strengths and weaknesses and isn't afraid to let other people see them. 
7	someone who is comfortable with themselves and stays true to themselves. honest. does their best. caring. that's what i can think of at the moment..
4	Someone who has a nice butt
3	Inner qualities do matter and I think they would reflect on the surface. But I do pay attention to physical beauty. I like well dressed and well mannered (but open) people. I want to feel easy and confident in their company to enjoy their beauty. 
2	when they sincerely want to help me and make me genuinely happy! instantly gorgeous 💕
2	Those who follow their own path. Counter culture types or at least those that know who they are and stay true to that.
1	Growth(striving and encouraging), acceptance, compassion, empathy, open mindedness and the intention to love. 
5	How do you speak?	My job is primarily on the phone and today someone commented that I was speaking 'garbled.' My co-worker said they were likely not listening to me/had no idea what I was talking about but I have had a family member mention I speak to fast/mutter sometimes. I don't see myself as speaking that way and I don't know if it's something that can be corrected? How can I speak to people in a less confusing way without babying them? 
6	I've noticed people very often, if not always, tend to ask "what?" after I've said something, I don't know if it's the tone or volume of my voice, there just might be something in the way I speak that I'm not aware of. I've had people get confused, more than once, about the message I'm trying to get across and it tends to be frustrating to me too. It also sounds normal to me when I'm saying it. It often requires conscious effort from me to use my voice louder so that others can hear it. I wonder if it's the side effect of being such a withdrawn person. We're doing voice exercises where I'm studying right now actually, so I hope that helps me with speaking more clearly to others.
4	Can you explain what is is like to be Fi?	As an ISTP, I would just like to understand some people I know a lil better. \n\nJust curious as to how my Ti differs from Fi
11	I have the Fi trait isfp, I can tell you that when someone around me is feeling a certain way(usually closer relations to me) I am able to instantly "put myself in their shoes". Others emotional energy effects my own, it's amplified in a group setting. Also, my first reaction to my environment is a feeling rather than a thought. The majority of my "thoughts" are feelings that encapsulates all of the related thoughts at once yet it appears in my mind as a feeling(sorta like an interactive color palette in a cloud of light) It's extremely difficult to put into words. 
6	I find it very easy to enjoy the simple things in the world that others look over because it simply doesn't cross their mind. Gentle breezes, nature, touching things with my hands and feeling immersed
4	Hello ISTP, this is INFP.\n\nWhen I look at the world around me I consider how it makes me feel. For example watching Rick and Morty makes me feel bad. It's far to nihilistic for me. So as a result I consider it to be hazardous for people who are sensitive or depressed. While the logical conclusion is that nihilism should convince one to not care and thus conquering depression, I believe telling yourself that no one matters in the grand scheme of things is unhealthy because of the message at face value and that it is counterproductive. This is the best example of how I form values with Fi.\n\nWhen it comes to emotion I can read it like book and place it back out into the world in the form of poetry, music, or astetics. I do this by understanding how I feel and associating words, notes, or colors with emotion and assembling it.\n\nWhen it comes to social situations my Fi allows me to understand the emotional states of others as a priority. I can empathize easily because of this which gives the INFP it's characteristic "healer trait". Empathy is the starting point from which I counsel others.\n\nHonestly I could go further, but it's late I hope I helped you out. r/INFP has a lot of traffic. I'm sure they could give you more answers if you want. :)
1	Engaging more than one person at a time is difficult. 
7	Fear of entering an artistic career?	Hey all! So I'm a recently self-discovered ISFP (have previously mistyped as INFJ - who would've thought we were so similar to them?) and love reading all these discussions with you cool people :)\n\nAnyway, I'm currently lost on where to go workwise: just graduated high school as valedictorian (took lots of AP classes, spent lots of times with IN--'s who I identified with academically) and was going into college planning to study math/economics to become an actuary. As someone, like all of you, trying not to drown in this increasingly STEM-oriented world, I feel like this is the smartest way to a stable income.\n\nBut like... as an ISFP, I keep feeling like that's not what life is really about. You know? Midway through senior year I became really interested in drag and female stage performers, and have subconsciously developed a really strong passion to pursue drag/art. It would be wholly fulfilling, let me express all of my creativity, and I know there wouldn't be one day that went by that I regretted choosing my path. However, there's just such a great risk associated with choosing this route - and a huge opportunity cost as well, giving up a STEM college education and basically betting my whole life on whether or not people like me enough as a performer. It's like I'm choosing between low risk-low return and high risk-high return at this point.\n\nWhat do you all think? I'm so freaking sorry this text was so long, but finally having a group of like-minded people to relate to is liberating and any feedback you all have is greatly appreciated. <3
9	Focusing on the success related aspects when creating art is harmful to the process. It makes the artist try and guess what other people like, when they should be really doing what they like and whoever else happens to enjoy it too is welcome.   That's when the artist can create something truly unique, because it comes from within.  \n  \nI was in the same boat as you once and this is the reasoning I came up with to justify taking the safer path.  \n  \nI don't regret my decision. My art helps me live and gives me joy. I look at the people I've met and connected with and think to myself that if I had the power to go back in time I would not use it. \nYou can trust yourself to make the right decision, because no matter what the outcome, it'll have meaning. 
4	I think the issue is that us ISFP's are pretty grounded and realistic, but our passions are often quite artsy, so pursuing them as careers can be scary.\n\nPersonally I'm going to keep my art, music, drag stuff as a hobby and stay on the technical side for my actual career. No reason your job should define you as a person. A good work/life balance means you can still do what you want, even if it's not your job.
3	Hey! I get where you're coming from - I always did really well in school, not valedictorian level but pretty good. I went to my first year of college as a Biology major and I hated absolutely every second of it. I did... Not well at all. And looking back, I really only chose it because I figured it's what I HAD to choose. \n\nAnyways. I'm now in my second year and I'm now a philosophy major and thoroughly enjoying studying. I'm not sure where it's going to take me in life and it's terrifying to not have a plan right now. But! I'm happy so that's really all I need. (Theoretically.)
2	ISFP dating INFJ for nearly two years. Similar? Maybe in a few things, but our minds work in very different ways.
2	An artistic career is an enormous ask these days.  I only committed after doing mixing on and off for ten years and being well above the competition.  Safer careers don't require even half of the same effort and they yield far more money earlier on.  But for me they weren't half as satisfying, so there are always tradeoffs and nothing will give you only benefits.\n\nThe only way the creative thing works is with **insane** commitment, basically the desire to be the best in the world at something (not saying that will necessarily/has to happen, but the desire must be on that level).  A lot of people fail this check.  It's not required for safer jobs whatsoever.
9	Feeling of loneliness vs horniness are too close for us?	I have felt this way for a while. When I'm single I'll get very lonely at times. When I feel this way I'll start using my imagination and either draw up emotions and memories from past relationships or make them up myself. This will slowly lead to me getting horny, "fixing" that urge, and then completely shutting off thinking to myself "why did I do that?". Maybe it's just the fact that I'm 20 years old and all my past relationships have been less wholesome and more horny all around. This all just leads me to think "was that all I'm good for? Satisfying myself and then completely shutting down? Not caring about the person I'm close with? Was it all for me?" I'm not sure. I guess I just haven't met to right person yet to challenge my need for sexual contact. I wonder if my loneliness is the natural side of me, seeking love and true companionship; while the hormone prone pubic me turns that loneliness into lust, sexual need, and eventually anger. I can't wait for this puberty shit to go away. \n\nAnyway thank for readying my post masturbation neurological insight.
5	I feel that! Well, kind of. It's kind of like when your horniness leads you to have a hookup at all costs, but then you end up somehow feeling attached to the person afterwards and feel lonely if they ignore you later on. Or maybe that's something different entirely!
1	Lol I came here to look at isfps and horniness bc of a joke on tumblr and here we are  
-1	It is our sinful nsture. \n\nSorry if you did not want a religious comment.

1	There are a few but secret crowds from Angels and Airwaves. When it comes you on my playlist i always go back and listen to it again\n
1	https://youtu.be/pQsF3pzOc54 \n\nEverything is amazingly delightful about this song. Fellow ISFPs please check this out by Mac Demarco 
1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4pcrMmP88A   \nIt's a mix between a specific shade of "sad" and an oradinary "happy".
34	ISFPs, why do so many of you watch the television with subtitles on??	I sort of like them too, especially with dialogue that's hard to register without them. It's just funny how frequently I see this with isfps.
26	I do this and get kind of annoyed when for whatever reason subtitles aren't available\n\nI do it because I like to be able to focus on other things than the sounds without fearing like I missed something important.  Volume varies, as does my attention (and other people can be intermittent distractions as well).  Subtitles ensure I can keep up while being able to focus on other details
19	I do it because I can't hear shit
8	I simply do it because English isn't my first language but I do watch most shows in English. Makes it just a tad bit easier.
8	I honestly don't know why I do it. Probably because if I don't understand what someone said, it'll be right there on the screen.
7	i cant catch dialogues, lyrics very well, like it doesnt really appeal to me i prefer reading it
3	Haha, my husband (ISFP) does this, but got me to start doing it too. We just joke we're deaf grandpas. Can't focus on the sound without having subtitles to reinforce what we're hearing.
3	My wife likes to talk through whatever we watch, if I'm going to follow the story to any degree they're mandatory.
2	I like to pick up on any jokes..I'll do it for shoes like suits versus game of thrones for example. I usually use subtitles when I admire the way they speak.
2	i grew up watching subtitles since my parents are deaf so when they're not on it's just strange for me. i also watch foreign movies/shows so that probably also has something to do with it. but mostly i just like to have them on in case i don't properly hear what's being said so i don't miss anything.
2	I actually dislike them. It distracts me and then I miss the visuals. I only have them up when watching anime. 
2	Subtitles are fine if you are watching something in another language or the audio is too quiet, but they are super distracting to me because almost all subtitles are slightly different than what you hear.  For example, someone in a show might say, "that's so crazy" and the subtitles just say "that's crazy."  Then I start putting more attention into seeing if the subs match the audio or not, and I miss out on what's happening in the show.
3	God I don't know why, but I fucking love you isfps. You're all so precious 
1	easier to read it than to hear it, easier to glance and see what was said rather than go back and try to hear it if I didn't catch something.
1	Well... I grew up with deaf parents who needed them, so now can't watch without haha (that definitely has nothing to do with being ISFP though!)
1	This struck a cord with me, I find it really intriguing. I like to understand what conversations are about. Sometimes they're easier to read than to hear, while processing the imagery. 
1	I do it because I can't stand missing any of the words, and without the subtitles you have to concentrate harder, and even then you can still miss something either because the person on the tv was too quiet or someone walks in and starts being loud af.
1	I don't.  Literally ruins my immersion.
1	I like to see the text and make sure I don’t miss anything important. And I have horrible hearing. 
1	i like making sure i understood everything being said, plus i love reading. 
7	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities\n\n* Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.\n* Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.\n* Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.\n* Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.\n\nNi/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:\n\n* Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.\n* Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.\n\nTherefore:\n\n* Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.\n* Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.\n* Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.\n* Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.\n\nAny comments, corrections, elaboration, or relevant anecdotes welcome.\n
9	Is it better to be wanted or needed?	In your relationships, romantic or otherwise, do you feel it is better to be needed or wanted?\n\nPersonally I feel that I could make myself useful in most situations and so I particularly like the feeling of being wanted because my thoughts reach the point of people not always wanting the things they need. \n
5	[deleted]
4	Wanted for me. 
4	Wanted- I've been needed for a lot of stuff with my family but never feel wanted by anyone. 
3	This question digs very deep.\n\n\n\nRomantically, the "wanting" will evolve to "needing", and I believe this is very normal in serious relationships. You start to date someone and keep seeing them, because you *want* to get to know them; it is a *choice* you are making. Later, you learn to need them to an extend....in a way that you don't need anyone else for whatever it is that they do for you. If you need help or support, that person is there and should be the first person you go to.\n\n\n If someone wanted to date you because they just need your financial support or whatever it maybe, it may be because they feel like they have no choice left but to settle. That's just my thoughts!
3	In familial love, I think it's natural to feel both love out of necessity and love out of genuine interest for your close family and friends. Most people start to realize that they genuinely just want to be around their parents because they love them for who they are at some point, but when they're young, unemployed, and a student, however, there will also be a bit of a codependent sort of love. I'm at the stage of my life where I feel a mix of both companionate and codependent love for my parents as a college student, who's unemployed. I'm growing out of the codependent stage of love for them, and it's been turning more so into companionate love as I've gotten older, but I also have to acknowledge that I do still need them to do what I want in my own life and to pay for things. \n\nHowever, I don't think that you should have codependent love for your close family your whole life. You gradually grow out of it, and these days that's usually finally over around the age of 25-30 for most people. Ultimately, you should just feel companionate love for your family when you find independence and stability in your life. \n\nIn romantic relationships, however, codependent love, love out of necessity, would be the LAST thing that I would want, and it's usually majorly unhealthy. I would much rather be loved and wanted for just being who I am in a romantic relationship with another person than being loved because I'm needed, or being someone's whole reason to survive and get up in the morning. I  would not want to be like my lover's mom, and treat them like my baby, who they can't live without. That's a sign of an unhealthy codependent relationship, and that's not what true romantic love is. \n\nTrue romantic love is loving someone, simply for just being themselves, and knowing that, though it might greatly upset you to let them go, you'd be able to do it, if they asked you, and you'd be able to ultimately move on with your life and survive without them in it. But if a romantic partner seriously loves their partner because they "need them" and "can't survive without them," then it's more like taking care of child than being in love. It's not healthy. 
2	Wanted. Codependence theory, basically if you need each other you can't be fully independent, and can't love each other as much as if you're separately self sufficient. The choice is more meaningful. 
2	To be wanted. I feel like that's closer to unconditional love.
1	Good question! I guess feeling wanted would be nice for the same reason you mentioned, the person in a sense has some "feeling" toward you instead of just needing something from you. 
1	I'm a little late this discussion but I have to say that it's better to feel wanted. I don't want to be kept around out of necessity, to fulfill someone else's arbitrary needs...I want to be kept around because someone genuinely enjoys being with me, and continually chooses to do so. Not to mention that being "needed" can be such a burden sometimes.
1	In my relationships I feel its better to be wanted. But at the same time I don't hold it against anyone or demmand from anyone that they have to "want" me. If Im close with someone and we drift apart or their life becomes busier or they get a boyfriend, I dont hold it against them or make them feel like shit. \n\nI cant stand it when friends in the past have gotten super pissed just because we started growing apart. Just because we dont hang out as much or talk as much doesnt mean I dont care all of a sudden. Its just how life works.
12	Do you guys get passive aggressive without even trying?	Let's just say I tend to be like that without even trying. Kind of like you know how some individuals tend to not know that they offend people? Well my deal is me being passive aggressive without even trying.\n\nI'm guessing that's like my defense mechanism to people I start to dislike? But when it comes to hate, I go 0 to 100 just like that. \n\nCan any of you relate?
4	[deleted]
3	My passive aggressiveness is the root of my sense of humor along with being goofy. I'm not an asshole, I'm just tastefully sarcastic and I laugh at myself all the time. It makes me happy. If I'm in a odd mood I'll turn into the total opposite, a carefree mopey stoner that forgets things and accidentally offends people because I assume too much. Usually happens when I don't eat enough.
1	[deleted]
1	Nah I'm just outwardly aggressive.
5	I thought we are creative :o	Yoo isfpersonalities, \nI thought we are a creative type, why are so many people pragmatic here then qwq
10	We find creative ways to be pragmatic ;)
3	The type is both of those things.\n\nI find the creative thing really overblown.  ESFP, INFJ, ESFJ etc often seem to have a much higher creative output, not to mention society's overvaluation of status and wealth - things far easier to obtain if you pick a more traditional career.  Money's not that hard to get, but satisfaction is.
1	You want everything working efficiently so you can safely be creative?
1	Te is in your stack sooooooooo yeah
6	I'm tired of being bullied and want to give up	All my life I've been laughed at, publicly humiliated and abused by family, boyfriends and colleagues. I'm never mean to anyone and I don't understand why I attract abuse. People instantly dislike me. I am always nice to people and at the age of 35, I want to give up on life. \nEveryone turns against me except for one friend, an INFJ. She is the only one who knows me and looks out for me and has never once been mean to me. \nI want to end it because I don't understand why it keeps happening. It feels partly due to low self-esteem, misogyny, and lack of love. I have crooked teeth which makes me very self-conscious so my smile is off. Is this why they hate me? I only want friends. Why do I keep attracting it? \nI don't know how to fix things. Is it an ISFP thing were I just can't spot things accurately so they keep happening? \nWhat's the point in living?
5	Love yourself before looking for love from others. 
3	[deleted]
2	It seems to me you suffer from a history of emotional abuse/neglect and childhood trauma. I understand your struggle with self-esteem issues. It is very debilitating, as much as it is a hindrance from reaching your to true potential. I don't think people dislike/hate you; they are probably just uncomfortable with the poor self-image created from your feelings of inadequacy that are projected onto them. And unfortunately, low self-esteem can attract toxic people into your life. But I agree with the comment above, that you should focus on self-love. It is very important that you learn to truly love/accept yourself (flaws and all) before you can move forward and give/receive love because you would always feel like you are not enough. I would recommend counseling/talking to a therapist about your issues and choose the best one that would be patience with you and work with you step-by-step, if you haven't not seek professional help yet. I also suggest reading self-help books/articles to put your doubts/fears into perspective. I don't know you but I do believe you have the inner strength to endure all the obstacles that life had thrown at you and build emotional resilience. So, do not give up on yourself please.\n\nedit: grammar
2	Go! You are the best! I am also an ISFP and I appear sometimes when other ISFPs are in need... I've been bullied too at school, but things change... Have Hope please, and DON'T DO ANY harm to yourself, save your life, for the partner who will really love you, don't let him be alone without a soulmate, lovely children of yours may not exist if you choose to end your own life... I recemmend you (if possible) if you have faith tendecies, trust Jesus Christ and See how you will never commit suicide... Your Life will be more important...\n\nAnd I want to say something that you really need, it may feel weird:\nI LOVE YOU! Even if I am stranger but based on my experience, I still need to be Loved so I can really feel your need to be loved... Please believe in yourself!! (and if possible believe in GOD).\nFORGIVE YOURSELF too!\nYou deserve that Self Forgiveness and Love...
1	I would be your friend.
1	I went through similar thing. At my last job I quit because of a bunch of bullies. I think people can tell who they can bully. So, after problems with everyone in my life every day for a decade, I began to pray to God and one day I had a wake up. I asked myself the question, what would happen if I just stopped defending myself? I believe God answered my prayer. I am healing inside and in my life every day. It is true that you have to have self-love because we must love our neighbor as Ourselves. That's not so easy to do. You need help but you probably don't love yourself enough to even ask for it. My mother is also narcissist so it is a very difficult situation to say the least but I have the same story, I am so sorry for you because I totally know how you feel but it is nice to know that I'm not the only one very lonely person that has to live with the past and the present and future with a narcissistic mother. This I can say, we are strong people. I always say I don't know how I ended up not dying of a heroin dose already... never touched it. Just to kill the pain and emptiness but I have had a relationship with God for years. I've always believed He has a purpose for me and that has kept me alive. When I had no one, I turned to books, tv and God. I believe there are people who can love us like we've never been loved but we won't meet them until we love ourselves enough. I avoid all contact with my mother nowadays. Eventually I may try to have a relationship with her but it will be with boundaries or not at all. I have come so far, I honestly hope you stay strong because you are worth it. Anyone that can survive a narcissistic family will surely have qualities that make them formidable. You my dear have the strength and bravery of a lion. And if you can find your way through, I'm confident that you have the ability to make a difference in the world because nothing will daunt you if you can overcome this. As for me, no one will be able to take away my happiness again. You can take everything I have, but you won't take my joy EVER. Now, I'm finding out that my mother didn't teach me a thing. I literally have to google everything to learn everything now. I thought I was a screw up but what I didn't know is that I learned all I know from a tv set! My dad was alcoholic too.
1	Aw babe! Don't give up, the way people have been treating you has nothing to do with who you are as a person or your personality. People are always so quick to judge based on looks or on one's initial demeanor, and I for one have been abused emotionally for being shy as well. The point in living is whatever you make it to be - but there is one. Whether it's the beauty in art or something you create, the excitement of forming new relationships, etc. you have a purpose and you deserve to fulfill it!!\n\nBy the way, INFJs are typically pretty fascinated with ISFPs, so if anything that's something you can remember, is that your friend genuinely cares about you for you - just one can make a huge difference. \n\nBest of luck love <3
1	Read this and instantly identified...and wanted to ask whether any of your parents had NPD. I see you commented further down that your mother is the narcissist, and you seem to have been the scapegoat child, bullied by the Narc & her army (siblings, family). \n\nI do believe that we end up being scapegoated in other aspects of life, due to the treatment in our childhood. Almost as if the initial narcissist leaves a marker on us that makes it easier for other narcs to find us throughout our lives.\n\nWould highly recommend therapy, specifically one that deals with PTSD/abuse/Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Also check out the r/raisedbynarcissists sub on here. \n\nI'm currently going through the same thing and haven't figured it out but I know it's possible. We can't change the abusers in the world,  but we *can* change the things about us that attract them. Sort of like avoiding bears in the woods or sharks in the ocean using safety techniques. \n\nI'm not an isfp (isfj) but I definitely think our abuse combined with eye for detail means we are on hyper alert and can see injustice everywhere, which makes it harder to get over, because we equate every injustice with our initial abuse. It doesn't make the adult bullying right or miniscule, but it does make it feel like some cloud or larger pattern of oppression that is too big for us to fight alone. \n\nIt is definitely possible & I would 100% recommend building up an assertiveness plan of action - how to be more assertive about things in general or behaviours you don't like for the people who you want to keep in your life (friends or family wiling to change)/cant remove from your life (colleagues). For everyone else, snip snip. ✂ Loneliness is hard but gets easier with time. Abuse never gets better.\n\nIf you ever need to rant or vent, you can message me anytime :)
17	Is anyone a 'bubbly' ISFP? Or are more laid-back?	I'm just curious. I haven't read anything about bubbly ISFPs. I don't know any ISFP in my life...People around me always consider me as bubbly, even though, so I sort of just accepted it. However, I do have a feeling that it's the type of people I hang out with. For example, my SO is INTJ (exact opposite except for the I).\n\n\n\nTo elaborate, I'm not cheerleader-*bubbly* at all. I'm a bit more socially awkward, but I'm more of a...adventurous, always-up-for-trying-something-new...kind of lady, and I like making talk and greeting people meet just to try to get them to smile. If it's awkward, then I just shrink back and carry on...\n\n\n(sorry for the typo in the title :( )
4	So fun! My so is an intj as well, her and I get along like peas and carrots. One of the best personality mixes I've known(isfp, intj). As an isfp I'm zen and quiet most the time unless I'm in a creative space or a great conversation then I put out more energy. My so is better suited for social situations than myself but we make a great team. 
2	People describe me as being very bubbly. However, I think I only come across as bubbly when I put in effort in making a good first impression or if I feel comfortable around you. Or if I'm really excited about something then I get overly bubbly. Otherwise, I'm shy and awkward as fck 🙈 
2	I'm definitely more "chill" than bubbly but on the rare occasion I might have the energy to be "bubbly" I guess.
2	My SO is an ISFP (I’m an INFJ myself) and he’s more laidback than bubbly but when I see him bubbly because he’s having a good day, I adore it. 
2	 Neither, really :p but If I had to choose it'd be lair back. I habe mild social anxiety at times and prefer to be alone. "Grumpy" would be a better description.
1	Sometimes if I'm excited about something I might be? I'm more of a laid back ISFP but certain things excite me, like exploring new places.. I'm naturally a very low energy person.
11	Do ISFPs typically get along with INFPs naturally?	I myself am a ISFP and have a good friend that's INFP. I was wondering if our friendship was natural or if we made it together with different personalties. I appreciate all feedback :) thanks
6	i actually have quite a few infp friends and i form really good relationships with them so i'm guessing our personalities are just compatible somehow 🤔 but no really i've been wondering the same thing since i get along with them so well
4	I generally do, but I tend to get along with everyone really
3	http://www.typeinmind.com/fise/\n\nhttp://www.typeinmind.com/fine/\n\nFi mega dom combo.\n\nIf you look at the functions it makes tons of sense. Both with each other trying to get stuff done (aux Se, helps 3rd Si) and figure stuff out (and aux Ne, helps 3rd Ni).\n  \nAlso, both bad at Te. ;D
1	INFP here. One of my best friends is an ISFP. We both love art and care a lot about authenticity (Fi doms).
1	Yep, I'm an ISFP and one of my closest friends is an INFP. She's actually the one who told me about the 16 personality types and convinced me to take the test. My younger sister is also an INFP.  I feel the most comfortable with them because its always a judgement free zone~ 
1	I have been changing best friends in the past few years and hadn't been successful, mainly because I don't talk much and these friends dreaded silence. it didn't feel comfy so these friendships didn't last long.\nSo now my best friend is an infp and we get along quite well. We don't talk much and we stay together to do our own things separately. it is comfortable and I like it :) . There is one time we went out tgt with my other friend and she complained about how quiet we are lol.
1	Stumbled here when I finally convinced my ISFP boyfriend to take the test. I'm INFP. He's my favorite human on the planet. 
7	How many times do you masturbate per week?	
14	High quality survey, can't wait to share the results on social media!
4	how do emotions come onto you	i feel like the title is somewhat misleading and not worded correctly but anyways. how do emotions look in your heads?? and how do you deal with em.\nfor me it's like a whole jumbled up mess of string that i can't seem to untangle... so much at once.. so i just push em down til i'm ready to deal with them at a later time. which can be both a good and bad thing i guess 
6	Bottle it until they become overwhelming and then don't know how to deal with them so I get super depressed and self loathing and suicidal 
4	Uhmmm i have no emotions in my head. If that makes sense. I have physical manufestations of emotion. Yeah i dont know how to explain that further. And i just let it out. Mostly. 
3	They usually just happen. I try to control my emotions but that’s usually easier said than done. When I do keep my emotions in, they always come out eventually. 
2	Idk I think my emotions can manifest in many ways... sometimes I can picture my emotions as little characters. Like insecurity would be like a highly avoidant person who would shy away from people a lot and be like "Noooo... don't come close to me! why are you getting close to me!", while happiness can sometimes take over my whole body... sometimes I imagine myself ranting at people, not that I would usually do that...
2	I feel like I've learned how to internalize in such a way that my feelings do happen in my head. I intellectualize them. Particularly strong feelings like love and affection I have a hard time allowing myself to really feel, because of past emotional trauma or whatever. And if I feel very upset or angry it feels physically uncomfortable so I tend to seek out ways to numb that as well. \n\nFor the most part I am pretty even and not easily overwhelmed or disturbed and I like that. Try to keep it on the chill side. I am definitely not the warm, affectionate type with any person except if I'm "with" someone and even then I go through periods of isolation and reservation.
2	They take complete control over me. I'll cry, I'll shake, I'll feel euphoric. I have trouble calming them down and usually I have to find a quiet spot to center myself again, listen to something to block the feeling out of my head, and recover.\nSometimes I wish I didn't have emotions, but then I remember all the good things they bring me, like passion to keep pursuing the things I love. :)
5	What are your hobbies?	Me:\n\n- Dancing\n\n- Piano\n\n- Listening to music\n\n- Reading comics/manga\n\n- Like cooking but the aftermath is too messy for me to handle
5	i always get stuck on this question when asked because i feel like i have no special/fun hobbies lol. but idk i like listening to music, playing the sims, taking care of my pet dog & rabbit, looking at home interior/exterior design and stuff cuz i think it's pretty. wish i could do more activities outside but have no one who really likes to do the same with me xD not sure if this counts but a lot of my time just goes towards thinking about stuff???? but ya really i'm just down for whatever
2	I love rock climbing, playing covers on my bass, hiking, singing, sitting in the grass, writing, and basically whatever else catches my attention and makes me happy. 
2	finding new music, self discovery, wheel throwing, journaling, writing lyrics, reading/audiobooks, sex, DIY anything, watching HGTV.
2	Running, reading books, writing, video games, collecting shiny things, occasional coding, internet research on something I found interesting, being around a lot of trees, drawing, listening to music, singing, exploring, frequent naps, thrift shopping, putting together lots of outfits involving mom jeans\n\nI honestly cannot sit still.
1	Playing guitar, drawing, travel, bicycling, swimming, listening to music, climbing trees
3	just curious to know what tv shows/movies you guys like to watch?	would like some recommendations. also would be cool to see if any of us have similar tastes in stuff i guess :) 
2	I've just about wrapped up breaking bad and love it, history channels Vikings too.\n\nMy favorite live action is Always Sunny in Philadelphia and I like a few 90's sitcoms.\n\nMy favorite stuff to watch is cartoons though from My Little Pony, South Park, The Simpsons, Futurama and a few others
2	right now im on Suits and Shameless\n\nedit: to add some detail to this. my ESFJ recommended I watch Suits because Harvey is an ENTJ and she thought I'd hate/love him. I don't hate him, I admire is qualities but would probably feel infuriated around him. \n\nAs for Shameless, I gave it a try on a whim and got addicted! my favourite character is Lip, who is IDed as an ENTP. Probably because I have never met a self-identified ENTP.\n\nI also lazily watch Game of thrones.
2	I'm watching Firefly rn!\n\nAs far as TV shows go, I loved Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Night Of, Westworld, and American Horror Story. TV shows are kind of a time commitment for me so movies win them over.\n\nI watch a ton of movies. I love love love all the Miyazaki movies, cheaply made Netflix horror, all of the Alien films, any Pokémon movie, Moonrise Kingdom, Interstellar and The Grand Budapest Hotel.\nWhimsical but also horrifying is the key word here.
2	 TV Shows:\n\nI used to watch OUAT for Rumbelle, until it went to shit, and I finally quit after S5 ended because I couldn't stand the writing anymore. I recommend not watching any of the episodes of that show after 3x11 because everything after that is bullshit. \n\nI used to watch TWD until they killed off my favorite character in the S7 premiere.\n\nI'm currently watching HBO's Game of Thrones, though the writing on that show often pisses me off too. \n\nI binge watched the first five seasons of AHS on Netflix, but I can't find S6 and S7 online, and honestly, I'm too lazy to search.\n\nI also love to watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Family Guy sometimes when I have nothing else to do.\n\nI tried Scream Queens, but got bored watching by S2.\n\nGlee (S1-S5)\n\nMovies:\n\nThe Breakfast Club (1985)\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off (1986)\n\nPretty much all of the late eighties to early 2000s Disney animated films. Frozen had some nice music, but I was born in 1995, so the Disney films that will always have a place in my heart will be The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, The Incredibles, Hercules, Mulan, Lilo and Stitch, Toy Story, etc. \n\nAnastasia (1997)\n\nThe Hangover (2009)\n\nA Little Princess (1995)\n\nWhite Chicks (2004)\n\nMrs. Doubtfire (1993)\n\nMatilda (1996)\n\nFreaky Friday (2003)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)\n\nThe Parent Trap (1998)\n\nHigh School Musical (2006) \n\nHigh School Musical 2 (2007)\n\nShrek (2001)\n\nShrek 2 (2004)\n\nSpider-Man (2002)\n\nSpider-Man 2 (2004) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
2	TV:\nBreaking bad, better call Saul, marvel agents of shields, elementary (first two seasons only. it gets boring later), Sherlock\n\n\nMovies:\n*Edge of Tomorrow\n*Notting hill\n*About time\n*Terminator series\n*X men series\n*The Shawshank redemption\n*Fight club\n*Singing in the rain\n*Groundhog Day\n*Pulp fiction\n--movies with great music, plot or funny settings, and I tend to watch movies about time travel, bad guys, and romance
4	Question: what's your opinion about school?	
7	[deleted]
3	Fucking hate it. I'm bored, I'm tired, the information is presented in ridiculous and complicated ways, assignments are pointless when I can just ace the test and still pass the class. And literally no human being being should be expected to get up and be at school before 8am, sit in a desk for 8 long hours and still learn anything. Then you are expected to do homework. The system rigs you to fail. There is zero personalization for learning techniques and I have no interest in any of the subjects offered. High school was a drag. Online college is awful. Campus college was never gonna be a success. /endrant\n\nIn all seriousness - I get that school is important and we need it for success and blah blah blah. But schools in other countries seem to a system in place that is a million times better than here. \n\nI genuinely want to learn and I want to love school but I can't. I've tried every technique suggested. Just can't be bothered with it. 
3	I go to a community college and I think it's OK, sometimes I have a lot of fun but sometimes it's very boring. I like it for socializing and spending time with people, but most classes aren't very interesting and end up feeling like a waste of time. My grades are mostly good, but I'm very bad at math and I have a few math courses I need to take before I can transfer. maybe it will be more enjoyable at a university, I don't know 
3	I hate the bureaucracy involved. And the useless courses (especially in college). Useless teachers are worse though-- you know, the ones who read from the PowerPoint. And I hate how some teachers have unfair expectations-- like the ones that don't let the straight A students sleep in class (hey, if we need to sleep in class, we probably just survived an all nighter) while they let everyone else do it because they're afraid of the students hating them. I actually had a teacher do this AND give an 80 to people who got 30s on the exam because he was afraid of the parents even though I worked so hard. Now I know why everyone loves him. That asshole actually told me to get the highest score on the AP exam (because he wanted to look good and probably because he thought no one else would be able to do it). I was like,"heh no" :) in my head. I study hard for myself, and I get good scores because teachers actually do their jobs, not because some overrated idiot tells me to :)\n\nSorry for the rant -- but this is what I hate about school.
1	For me id say I kind of enjoy it only because I'm interested in my major, (mass communication) but like you said I too tend to doodle on my notes time to time :P
1	craziest time of my life, cant believe it is ending soon
6	ISFPs, how strong is your se?	I know a lot of ISFPs who have 6 and 9 in their tritype. 6s are known to be security-oriented and correlated with Si. 9 is all about that comfort. I know many Fe users who have 6 and 9 in their tritype too. With all of this, I'd assume some ISFPs appear more like Si users than Se users. If not, I'd assume the 6 and 9 would at least lessen how "Se" they are.\n\nSo to you ISFPs, how strong is your Se? Do you all love change, physical activities, getting "lit", thrill, taking risks, etc? If not, how does your Se work?
3	My Se is pretty weak. I don't pay attention to my surroundings at all sometimes. I think it's because I'm maturing and focusing on my Ni right now. \n\nI have to get back focusing on Se. ;)\n\nI am enneagram 4w3.
2	I have a strong Se but it's full of contradictions. Like I would love to go skydiving but I'm afraid of heights.

5	Hello! It is I, an ENTP!	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion? Thank you!
3	The best way would to drop a **clear** hint that you’re interested, preferably a statement. Then just wait and see how we respond. If we’re interested we’ll reciprocate, if not we’ll make it obvious with our actions.
2	Formally on a date, not to 'hang out'. I am the evasive one so it drive me crazy when they are evasive/fickle as well.
1	Be straight up. I hate having to rack my brain into figuring out whether you like me as a friend or not. I'm also kinda dense to hints so make it easier for both of us and be direct as possible.\n\nEdit: You posted the question twice and I read some answers from the previous thread that I want to add. While I do like directness, it's better if it progressed naturally over a mutual hobby, say yoga class or something. We have to be friends or at least acquaintances or else I find it a bit strange.
14	Does he sound like an iSFP?	18. Plays a ton of sports. He likes history, wants to do history. \n\nHe's very impulsive, would skip classes to do random stuff. But he 'studies' for long periods of time. (Lots of zoning out though) Also gets quite mediocre grades. Words like fickle, restless and unfocused can all be used to describe him. \n\nFrom what I have gathered, he falls for girls easily. And gets over them in a very short time. He said he's submissive in nature, but he likes... being the more dominant one in relationships, that's why he likes shy females?\n\nI'm ENTP, and I'm not sure if he feels the same way, but our conversations feel insubstantial. At least the online ones. It's easier to talk to him face-to-face. He's very open to my weirdness and he gets my dark humour. But still insubstantial. We used to text everyday, but it felt very exhausting on my end because we are very different people and I felt like I constantly had to act bubbly and nice when we text. Otherwise he would feel uncomfortable.\n\nHe's also very averse to conflict and drama. If he senses conflict he would try his best to *not* get involved.\n\nHe's also a very nice person. He can't stand the idea of someone disliking him, so he tries his best to be nice to everyone. I don't think he engages in any form of art-making, song-writing, or poetry-composing. But he has this hidden depth. When prodded, he can and will discuss functioning parallels between his friends, motives of his counterparts etc. etc. He uses big words too. \n\nHe has a TON of friends. But he has no qualms about being seen alone? He eats alone quite often. But he's a chill person. He makes friends easily, bonds with them over sports. 
3	Yeah sounds totally like me (isfp) lol 
2	Yes he does. I am an isfp myself. 
2	It sounds more or less like me, except I have zero interest in sports and I am in love with doom metal.
2	Jesus sounds just like me. Great analysis 
1	Late response, and also echoing off of everyone else's, but this sounds like the male version of me 👍 I would definitely say ISFP
2	is my brother an isfp?	some facts about him:\n\n- he enjoys playing guitar and writing songs and really enjoys it when he masters a hard song on guitar\n- he has a bandcamp page and the design of it is really important to him\n- he dislikes sports but is good at them when he actually tries\n- he constantly switches between "energetic and weird" and "chill and smart" \n- he used to dance as a hobby when he was younger\n- art is his life\n- he's very lazy at school, although he's incredibly good in the subjects he's interested in\n- he can seem like an intp at times, dunno why\n- he wants to be different from everyone else\n- he feels everything very intensely so when he's happy he's REALLY REALLY HAPPY YAY and when he's sad he almost wants to kill himself
1	Only your brother can decide
1	Okay, art and music doesn't revolve around our lives. Those are just stereotypes. Not. Facts.\n\nSee if he's reserved when it comes to strangers, thinks before acting, watches instead of doing, etc.. That's the Introverted part. Is he more detailed-oriented and in the moment or big-picture-oriented and looks a lot into the future? Being more detailed-oriented and in the moment is the Sensing part. Does he put his feelings over the logical reason? If yes, then he's a feeler, which is the Feeling part. And lastly, does he keep up a routine and is organized? Perceivers, which is the P of ISFP's, tend to be flexible and adaptable, but lack a routine.\n\nHoped it helped!
1	He sort of sounds like an INFP.  But hey, you could always let him test and figure it out!
6	HELLO, IT IS I, AND ENTP CONDUCTING A SURVEY	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?\n\nThank you!\n
13	I always feel that it seems awkward to be "asked out".  I like to let something progress naturally from shared activities/interests, or kind of a mutual understanding that we want to spend more time together.  If we like and understand each other, we'll text/talk more and more, get to know each other better, and grow closer, and when we finally discuss our "relationship status" there are no surprises. This is how my happiest relationships have always begun. \n\nI only want to date someone that I'm head over heels for, which doesn't happen every year. 
8	I'd find it awkward to be approached unless I knew them well. I prefer to meet and get to know someone naturally, then for it to get romantic there'd have to be sort a of "click," where I would sense that neither of us get tired of each other through harmless jabber. \n\nEven if they're really cute, the chances are, the relationship won't go very far if there was no "click" beforehand.\n\nBasically, ISFPs prefer not to rush into dating someone, I think.
7	I would very much appreciate a non-romantic fashion: E.g. a sports activity, exotic food with friendly conversation, some urban exploration or a hike. Something to get to know each other. \n\n(I'm German, so none of those strict dating rules I hear about from America.) 
5	Honestly, being a guy I don't usually expect to be approached.  So I'd just appreciate if it were to happen at all XD 
5	We are probably ten times more likely to ask someone out that we are already friends with. My nerves would kill me if I had to ask out a stranger. You won't catch me in a bar, but funky restaurants are cool and so are book stores
3	The idea of an interaction occurring solely from a place of romance stresses me out and makes me uncomfortable. I think that's why it's hard for me to actually connect with people through online dating? The end game is already set up in the foundation. So if a stranger right out the gate asked me out I will probably say no unless conversation starts in a way that doesn't imply they are interested in me especially if they are mainly physically interested in me. That sounds crazy, but I just feel weird if someone who knows nothing about me is super into me from first impressions. I feel like I didn't earn the desire if that makes sense. \n\nIf a stranger saw me with a book about a specific topic and they also read the book and decided to start a conversation with me about it, I'd be more inclined to go on a date with them if conversation went smoothly and we clicked. If a stranger from a bar, or anywhere for that matter, asked me out because he likes what he sees i'm 100% not taking it seriously. The furthest that will go is a fwb or text buddies.\n\nI'd prefer to actually know or meet someone through similarities. So like a hobby or class. If I don't meet someone through that way, there would just have to be some kind of deeper base that goes further than looks. I guess i'm kind of contradictory though because I also wouldn't think of dating someone i'm not sexually/physically attracted to. I'm not sure if that's actually what you're asking though. \n
3	No asking out, too awkward.
2	The most important thing is if I already like the person AND want to be in a relationship at the time. I don't like it when people I don't really know ask me out. I think it's sweet when he seems vulnerable and nervous asking me out; it shows sincerity. 
8	Survey for ISFPs on Movies	Hi guys! I'm an ENFP writer, and I'd like a little assistance with a project I'm working on if anyone is interested in contributing. I'm curious to see if there are similarities between movie preferences for each personality type. If you want to help out, list your top 3-5 films from any genre, and feel free to explain why if you are so inclined. \n\nThanks in advance, and have fun!!!
4	Drive, Fight Club, Big Lewboski, Waking Life, Dances with Wolves
3	Interstellar, Moon, all of Harry Potter, Arrival (My favorite by far), Inception\n\nLove sci-fi, weird concepts carefully explained and implemented visually, like to be surprised, emotional gets a plus.
3	* Matrix (only the 1st one) it has a very big sentimental value as I use to watch it with my brothers and dad, and we watched it a lot...\n* Hitch Hikers guide to the galaxy, I love the books.\n* A million ways to die in the west. got me through an emotional time.\n* The dark Knight, I mean greatest Joker performance ever. \n* The Prestige, some of my favorite actors in one movie. \n\nI have more but you said 3-5 :o. So I limited it xP
2	In no particular order of just my favorites:\n\nInterstellar\n\nKingsmen\n\nEmpire Strikes Back (the whole series really but ya know)\n\n\n
2	It would be easier if you had a list to check because there are too many movies and all my favorites would probably not have much overlap with others:\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nSon of White Mare\n\nM\n\nForce Majeure\n\nStalker\n\n\n
2	10 things I hate about you\nThe Island\nAll harry potter\nClueless\nMen in black\n\nit's mostly nostalgic feel good for me
2	The Prestige- the first movie that got my into my now favorite genre, mindfuck/psychological thrillers\n\nInterstellar- Went to the theater with no background of what the movie was about because I was bored and couldn't stop thinking about the movie for a good two or three weeks afterward. Everything about that movie was perfect. It was so aesthetically pleasing to look at and the premise itself immersed me into a movie more than other movie I can think of. Also, this was the first movie I watched multiple times in theater. \n\nMemento- Honestly, I just love Christopher Nolan.\n\nThe Truman Show- I get a warm, fuzzy feeling when I even think of this movie lol I can't explain exactly what about it I love though. I get the same feeling from movies like "Harriet, the Spy", and that one movie where the whole town is black and white because it's an old tv show and then tobey macguire and his sister "corrupt" it and things start to have color. I think I get a nostalgia feeling from the movies since I loved them when I was younger? Idk, but they give me guaranteed instant feel good vibes.\n\nSynechdoche, New York- It makes me uncomfortable and made me think of a lot of questions I usually wouldn't.\n\nedit: Just to add, my favorite movies tend to be either stupid funny like "This is the End", psychological thriller like the ones listed above, or dystopian/sci-fi like "In Time". 
2	Hot Fuzz\n\nScott Pilgrim Vs. The World\n\nThe Emperor's New Groove\n\nShaun of The Dead\n\nShrek - The Original \n\nI have always been more inclined to watch an action film more so than a comedy one but my most favorite movies tend to amusingly be comical in nature. I'm someone who is a big fan of fantasy settings and would absolutely love a big hit Lord of the Rings esque franchise to release in the near future. A good one, aha. I actually found the Harry Potter movies intriguing too. Such fantastic atmosphere. \n\n\n
2	E.T.  It is just a perfect movie IMO. The score is amazing and it's just so beautifully done.\n\nStar Wars (1977) The one that started it all. The original cantina scene is probably my favorite scene from all of the SW movies. Such a great introduction to a larger world. \n\nHunt for the Wilderpeople. I love the flight of the conchords-esque style of humor and there is so much heart in this movie too. So glad to see Taika Waititi directing Thor Ragnarok\n\nDrive. Beautifully shot and the soundtrack kicks ass. I love how this movie is just one giant crescendo.\n\n\nShaun of the Dead/Forgetting Sarah Marshall. My favorite comedies. The jokes just never let up with either of them and both are so well written\n\n\n\n
2	I realize I'm pretty late to the party here but I think you should consider a different format for these. I think you're getting a lot of response bias from people seeing a movie that was already commented and since it's in their minds they'll comment it too.
1	Shawnshank Redemption, American Beauty, Requiem for a Dream, Interstellar, Your Name. I like emotional and a bit philosophical stuff.\nEdit: The Wire (series).
1	Interstellar, Raiders of the lost ark, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Empire Strikes Back
1	Interstellar, Jurassic World, The Martian, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Big Hero 6 for animations.\n\nI love sci-fi movies.
1	harry potter and the order of the phoenix, dead poets society
1	The shawshank redemption \nThe dark knight\nBraveheart\nStar Wars trilogy (if I have to choose, Empire, DUH)\nLOTR trilogy (if I have to choose, return of the king)
1	Almost all of Miyazaki's films are fantastic. Sometimes I won't be able to put into words exactly what the morals of his films are but I always feel satisfied after watching them. Also, Hisaishi's music is equally stunning. 
1	Fight club, Shawshank redemption, Whiplash 
1	Eyes Wide Shut\n\nSuspiria\n\nAmerican Graffiti\n\nA Clockwork Orange\n\nTree of Life\n\n\nI like movies that have a very intense atmosphere. Like dream-like. Where the visuals + music are super important.
1	**Inception** - The concept of constructing worlds and committing all sorts of deeds inside another person's dreams is mind-bogglingly awesome! It takes lucid dreaming to whole new level. It's very abstract and subtle but still told in such a way it's easy to grasp what is going on.\n\n**28 Days Later** - Rage.. It's not voodoo, it's not scary black magic, it's not a super secret military experiment gone wrong. It's just rage. "Just rage". It's in the blood.. I love the music and the setting and how well *Cillian Murphy* displays confusion and fear.\n\n**Cast Away** - I can't really put my finger on why I like this movie so much, but I re-watch it at least once a year since it came out and when it first came out I watched it a bunch of times. It might be that the idea of losing everything and starting over with absolutely nothing on a desert island is very romanticized and somewhat compelling. Coping with the thought that nobody knows what happened to you, and that they must all go on with their lives thinking you're dead. There's so much despair and a touch of dread and just general sadness in this movie that I can't not watch it.
1	In no particular order...\n\n\n* Say Anything (1989)\n\n\n* Memento (2000)\n\n\n\n* Marvel movies, hard to pick! (all the X-Men, Spiderman, etc)\n\n
3	ESTP dating ISFP	nope
3	I dont think its abnormal, clearly he has been hurt and now he is hesitant to do something due to the indecent with the other guy. I guess you have to lure him back with sometging that shows him you care. A bit like luring a cat. First thing that came to my mind was for you to physically go to him. Idk how he works and if he is busy and all. Don't force things.\n\nAnother part of me says to leave it. Dont feel sorry for him. I guess that's worse, as in he needs to be able to deal with his insecurities. But if you are interested in him and the relationship then carry on. I know it seems harsh but you will actually be helping him in a way. \n\nI know I have worded this weird. Hopefully it gets through as intentded. \n
3	My first time being hurt I was like this too. It was during my highschool years so my recovery/healing time went alongside me gaining maturity from teen to adult so it was less painless. Anyway here's how ISFP's work, at least for me. If we aren't in a relationship, we crave to be so much. The second we find one, we tend to cling very strongly to our SO. Our relationships depend on trust and the second that trust is broken even the slightest, you're fucked. It takes a lot of time for me especially to accept you back to my good side. If you see a sad ISFP let them know you care. The easiest way to get to our hearts is too love the fuck out of us. Not too much, but back rubs aplenty we love being loved. If anyone tries to break up our relationship by taking our SO's away or for themselves, we either have the balls to fight to the death for you or we don't and we become depressed as fuck. We rely on trust because we love feeling that sense of importance and meaning from others. That feeling especially is what drives me, the "I can make anyone happy and make a difference in the world" feeling. If I were you I would evaluate what you want in a relationship and how much you like this ISFP. He's going to take some time to heal and he's definitely going to take more time to be understood by his SO. Nothing's worse than a relationship where two people don't understand how their SO's think. If you want to be with this person you have to be devoted and see him more often.
3	He sounds emotionally unavailable.\n\nThis would be a red flag for me if I heard this from a girl on the first night "you won't leave me will you?". It signifies a potential  neediness and a broken self-esteem to mewhich is always a slow-drip disaster over time. \n\nAlthough I don't know a ton about MBTI (I'm an ISFP male) For me, I have to "allow" someone to get close to me before It'll go any deeper. I hate it, honestly. Very few people, let alone relationship targets, ever get that far. shrug.. I know very few ES, but they do have a way of unlocking that barrier at a faster rate.  My daughter is an 18-year old ESFP and she's the closest person to me. Not just because she's my daughter. \n\nIf I let a person close then you're in, but if I get betrayed then it's that much worse. I shut-down, and become unavailable for anyone. After 2 EN's burned me, I'm not sure I can connect to anyone anymore. I have interested attractive options(not bragging), but I just am unable to connect. I stopped dating as a result because it's not fair to me or anyone else until I feel I can. \n\nAs far as the other person, depending on what happened I'd definitly withdraw some. I'd think I was another option possibly. But like I said, it depends on what happened, how it was portrayed, and how your actions lined up versus the "story". Being open and reassuring will help, but I know in each case I've been burned there was a situation early on in the relationship that should have been taken as a red flag along certain "just a friend" lines, so I'm much more likely to withdraw depending on the situation. \n\nHe just might not be that interested? I'm indifferent for the most part unless I'm in to someone... \n\n
3	I don't really think this is a type thing...he just sounds reaaaallly not ready for relationship.  I think it's in your best interest not to try to fix him.  The dude has some issues and he needs to be responsible to sort them out himself.
5	Trying to figure out an elusive iSFP	I'm INFP. About a month ago I began chatting with an ISFP guy online, and we ended up chatting for about 2 weeks. The reason it went on for so long was because it was difficult to try to get him to arrange a time to come and see me. But I really enjoyed chatting with him, he was so funny and sweet and would sometimes make me cry with laughter. We both seemed very interested in the same kind of thing from a relationship, where we both wanted to experience something serious since we were both tired of the promiscuity that is rife in the gay community. And he seemed really into me, where he would initiate the conversation every single day.\n\nThen we finally agreed a day. He even told me what train he was going to get. But then on the day we were supposed to meet he just stopped replying altogether. After a few days of hearing nothing from him I decided to delete him on all social media.\n\nA month later I saw him on tinder and I swiped left just out of intrigue. We matched. He then wrote to me on tinder and said he was sorry and said that he liked me so much that he got really nervous and just stopped responding. Then he did the same thing where he was writing to me a lot and I got reminded of how much I enjoyed speaking with him, so I eventually agreed to meet him.\n\nThis time we did actually meet. I went to his neighbourhood and we went to a cafe together. Afterwards we went swimming in a lake (we had agreed upon this beforehand so we both brought swimming trunks). We subsequently sat behind a rock in our swimming trunks and chatted and made out. I really enjoyed the day. I was possibly slightly more reserved than I might otherwise have been because I was apprehensive about letting myself be too swept away by him in case he might just ignore me again. But now after we met, he's gone completely cold again. He hasn't stopped replying to me altogether but it takes him about a day to reply to my messages, whereas before he would often reply almost instantly.\n\nI don't know what to do or think about him. I really liked him - thought he was gorgeous, kind, funny. But he just seems to be making things very difficult.\n\n(Another note: He took a photo of me when I came out the bathroom which I also thought was a bit peculiar.)
8	I don't know if this is just me but I've realized I'd ISFPs are a lot like cats. We want intimacy on our terms, maybe a little commitmentphobic, but can be very cuddly and sweet when we want. When the other person is showing an intense interest we may get spooked because it's a lot of attention we're not used to but sometimes we enjoy that rush. \n\nBut maybe that's just me, though I've noticed it in other ISFPs \n\nSo my advice to you is to throw the aloofness back at him, don't get too invested or show too much interest, maybe even ignore him a little so he has room to want you. \n\nSomething you can do is telling him hey I'll be at X place doing X this day and time if you want to join me you're more than welcome and then do that thing whether or not he shows up, show him you don't need him but he'll have fun with you if he's willing to put in some effort. 
6	ISFPs are underrated. We are amazing partners if you have the patience to get to know us. We are secret cuddlebugs that hate being betrayed/let down, so our vulnerabilities are experienced x10
3	ISFP Fi dom is weird as fuck. Same thing going on here. They'll have to decide for themselves. Fickle ass type.
1	pretty straight forward. \n\nHe's not that interested. 
9	Do you believe you are more sincere than other types?	I believe it has something to do wi feeling like the odd one out, but I've never met someone that I've truly connected with or shared my values (honesty, loyalty, dependable, supportive). In fact, in recent months I've found myself getting shallowly involved with people completely missing these qualities, after getting hurt I retreat and cut them out. Sure, being alone is better than having shitty people in your life, but it's hard. I feel completely alone other than my coworkers at work.
6	"owner of a lonely heart, much better than an owner of a broken heart..."\n\nISFPs tend to be of the "authentic" types:\nhttps://personalityhacker.com/authenticity-as-a-decision-maker/\n\nThe opposite is the effectiveness type people, which tend to be much more celebrated especially in western culture. A good idea for ISFPs is to get out and explore more, especially cross-culturally. If able, try traveling, learning another language, or meeting people of other cultures.
2	You'll find other people who value the same things you do. It just takes time and maybe a little effort to find more people who get us. I mean I'm not gonna lie I've been having this issue myself but it's better than sticking around a toxic environment 
2	Yes, there was a time in college I felt like this. I transferred and met someone I vibed with really well. But he liked me afterwards and I when I found out I couldn't open up to him anymore. Wish we could talk like we used to. \n\nThere are times when you'll feel completely lonely. But sometimes special people will walk into your life. I agree it's better being lonely than having shitty people in your life. Staying true to yourself is important because one day you'll find someone who appreciates you exactly as you are. 
1	I get a sincere vibe from ISFP's. Good on you cutting ties with toxic people. Might be hard now, but if you keep at it and not compromise your values and such you are more likely to form relations with those that appreciate them.
3	How many of you guys leave your dirty socks on the floor? Is this an ISFP thing?	I know two of you who do this, a man and a woman.\n\n I am an ENFJ and I need to know if this is a scientifically accurate ISFP phenomenon. :O
7	I know this is like r/shittymbti troll question but. ..... yes, yes I do.  ;D\n\nedit: it's not about socks specifically, it's just my room is always a little bit of a disaster, and sometimes it's tough to get to the laundry basket :/
5	all P types
5	You mean "gently used"
2	Can confirm. I'm in the process of moving right now and I haven't cleaned my closet in my 19 years of being alive, AMA
2	ISFP friend does this all the time
2	i'm pretty sure other types would do this as well but yes, yes i do leave dirty socks on the floor xD
2	Guilty
2	Don't forget the homework assignments! :)
2	I leave them on my shoes if I used them once or twice. This way I can just equip sockshoes faster.
1	ha! I didn't even know that was a subreddit xD thank you for that.
1	ha! that's totally accurate to both of them too. xD
6	Do you like to eat as you do something or not?	Do you eat as you do something (browsing, video games, TV, YouTube, podcasts, movies, etc) or do you tend to focus on eating when you eat? 
8	If I'm eating something tasty, I like to focus. Specially when I get the munchies, mmm. But if it's just boring old frozen lunch, I like to eat it watching youtube or netflix so I don't have to notice the taste, or that it's not properly heated, just eat it because it's healthy.
7	I read 'do you like to eat ass as you do something or not?', ahaaa!!
1	Is this type related? I might eat while also browsing the internet or watching tv. My brother, who seems to be intj, prepares his meals and eats them at the table while doing nothing else, which I find sort of odd. I have some ADD a little bit, I think.
2	What are you studying/What would you like to study?	When summer ends, i'll start my last high school course, then i'll go to the university. I would like to work on something that lets me help other people, my options to physiotherapy or engineering (CS). I will probably end studying engineering because it has more employment opportunities but i think i'll love to study physiotherapy because i really like how the human body works. So I have a full year to choose and that's not enough time for me to decide. Sorry for unnecessary text, i felt bored.
2	I am a physio. I enjoy it. I find doing what I enjoy is better than doing what will be the better career choice. What is the point doing something you dont likr. But use the time to maybe shadow both professions. Might help you decide. 
1	I'm studying psychology and want to be a Physician Assistant  
1	I want to be a nurse. I work now as a dental assistant and helping people every day satisfies me in a way. I'm hoping to go to CSLB for the BSN program. It's really hard to get in though 🙈
7	Crushes	Do you get crushes easily? I used to catch them a lot when I was younger but now I've noticed I'm becoming pickier on who I like. 
10	This is 100% me. I always had crushes when I was younger, and even through college, but not anymore. I rarely find myself interested in people romantically anymore and it makes me sad. 
6	I don't think I ever developed crushes *easily* and I still don't and it makes me feel alone. But when I do get a crush on someone boy-howdy does it hit me HARD
3	It hits me hard. I am super suspicious of others because if they hurt me it hurts 10x as much
4	It depends how you define crush. .. I can have little crushes on a lot of guys simultaneously, kinda like an extrovert would. I don't act on it, I control myself, but I almost always have a crush on at least one person if not more. 
1	Oh god, I'm horrible with crushes. They'll pretty much consume my entire life. I'm in a great relationship now but I'm still prone to crushes, though I won't act on them. I am definitely picky though. 
15	Do you guys suppress your feelings to the point where you can come off as a thinker?	I have had this "nice guy" syndrome for most of my life. Until I decided to change and train myself to change that and be less emotional since summer 2016. Now people don't consider me this nice guy anymore. In fact....people think I am too cold sometimes. \n\nAny of you relate to this? Not like I wanted to change, I had to. People seem to take kindness for weakness. 
5	I can totally relate to this... I remember when I was a in high school a "friend" asked me "why are you always smiling?" Like it was a bad thing. I remember I consciously decided to stop smiling and progressively started to act more like a thinker...weird how something so small had such a big affect on me. Now in college I'm starting to recover and accept that it's ok to have feelings.
4	I tested as an INTJ until high school because I was hardcore suppressing my feelings. I love my INTJ friends! But once I got more comfortable and okay with actually caring about stuff then it's like a switch flipped. Consistent ISFP now.
3	In public I probably look like the most anti-social person on the planet, and it doesn't help that if I'm in a situation in which I can, I will have earphones in because if I don't I'm overly self-conscious. I always feel like people see me as some sort of freak or weirdo.\n\nWhen I'm with close friends and family I'm usually pretty easygoing and expressive.
2	I feel for you. I've always thought that if I were a guy, I would have it pretty rough because society is a lot more accepting of females being nice and having feelings than guys. If I were a guy I'd probably do the same as you, but it sounds like it might not be healthy in the long run. 
2	My change came from a close friend of mine pushing me to my limits every single day. I finally took a stand for myself and refused to take any shit from him after over two years of dealing with this. Out of literally nowhere, he dumped our friendship calling me all sorts of awful names and terms claiming that I was manipulative and that I was turning our other friends against him so I would be his only friend (I know now he was projecting his own feelings of himself onto me). It ended badly. I wish him well and hope he is doing good but I never wish to be his friend again. \n\nChange is a good thing. Embrace it. Those who don't like it aren't worth your time. 
2	Glad somebody made this post. I've become a hardcore thinker out of out necessity for my job, insecurity about my intelligence and because I've had so much more free time to think (having a hard time making friends after moving across the nation for a job)\n\nEvery day feels like I'm playing the role of someone I want to be but am not yet qualified for. My emotions are completely suppressed and I approach social interaction from a detached, judgemental, hyper rational standpoint. It's caused me a lot of personality crisis and anxiety since I can't fool myself, I'm changing and not very fulfilled about it\n\nI used to have a ton of close friends, I was always the high-energy jokester than people liked being around, but could also share deep emotional conversations. \n\nI think this is mostly the consequence of my environment though
1	Welcome to Fi.
1	I'm pretty cheerful, even when I'm feeling gloomy inside. I repress my feelings so I won't suffer like I did in the past, so I used to consider myself a natural thinker, until I got into therapy and read a bit about psychology and stuff. Still not ok with my feelings.\n\nYou can still change, and become [kind but strong](https://markmanson.net/boundaries). It's slow but it's possible.
1	Yes, definitely. 
7	Low numbers	Why are there so few ISFP's??
7	So few in general or so few in this subreddit? For the latter I can think of a few reasons, like people not knowing their personality types, not wanting to let it "define" them as if joining the sub would do just that, or simply not knowing about the subreddit. 
2	Umm, I'm pretty sure ISFP is kinda middle of the road in terms of what percentage of people fit the description. There are personality types that are far rarer. 
1	INFP here. My opinion is that ISFPs have a much more tangible approach in bringing their values into the sensory/"real" world that you won't find them online as much. Also: an ISFP can look like a goth girl with piercings everywhere, a quiet man wearing camo who goes to the gunclub every Saturday, or the acoustic guitar playing guy at the coffee house. They can tend to wear their identity on their sleeves, literally. In my experience, they are so individualized that they don't tend to appear alike in real life as other types.\n\nINFPs tend to be recognized "in the wild" concerning the ways they are misunderstood/unable to interface with the world, and they usually bond about this fact together instead of bonding about "what's important to them". And I argue that the "what's important to them" part is a bigger piece of who they are than the "I'm so misunderstood/can't adapt to this world" side of their lives. It's just a thing that brings them together because their differing values are usually expressed in the abstract.
10	Anyone else get called "serious"?	hi everyone, i'm an isfp (i think). i don't feel as if online descriptions entirely of isfp match me; but the functions do very well and so that's what i'm going by! anyways, to the point:\ni'm still young, but many times over the years i have been called either serious or too serious. at first i took it as a compliment, being serious can be a good thing. but then i realized some people don't think i can be fun, or i can't take a joke because they think i'm serious all the time. maybe that's all in my head though. but i hate it. i think some of it might have to do with my face/voice not showing a lot of emotion or people not catching onto it. \ni always enjoy a good laugh even though i may not make jokes or gags myself. i love having fun, i may be much more reserved than others though. but what i do know is that i'm in the moment, enjoying every single thing that is happening around me. it's not like i'm just sitting there not enjoying myself. and that's why i hate being called serious. i feel like people don't see the real me. i mean, that's fine but that's not really who i am inside!!! i yearn to have fun in actuality. that was just a side point...\nand i think i may come off as serious maybe because when people are talking to me i really think about what they are saying/doing and immersing myself in the conversation??? i don't really know.\nit's almost as if people either see me as not having any worries so they don't bother being serious with me or they think i'm not fun enough. it goes both ways. and it kinda sucks.\nthis is kind of just turning out to be me rambling on and on so i'll stop here but any of you guys ever feel this way? get called serious? do you like it or not?
6	I'm an ISFP and I've always had that problem too especially in high school. I'm 20 now, and it's definitely gotten better, but I find that hanging out with a smaller group of my close friends (or even just one) helps me loosen up more. So I tend to do that most of the time. 
3	I'm pretty straight-laced so from people that don't know me very well, yes I do. Around my close friends I loosen up and joke a lot.
3	[deleted]
5	I think some people perceive me as serious. I'm very observant and generally a quiet person. I'm not too great at talking because  when I'm trying to explain things/talk I can never seem to find the right word. I care a lot about my future career.  Those things combined might make me seem serious. Although some times I can be very lighthearted and play along with groups,  I generally dislike groups because people speak over on another and the whole not being great at speaking means that my jokes/timing aren't really that good.
2	i (think) i'm an isfp too and i used to be reallyyyy serious. i still am pretty serious at home but outside i'm pretty easy going until pissed off. how old are you? id you're really young then that's prob an explanation 
2	People have said this to me since I was young and I hate it too. I got bullied when I was little for being too serious. And people who like to go to clubs say I don't know how to let loose. Some people just can't comprehend that not everyone likes partying :/ Or they feel like I'm judging them. Don't let it get it you. You have your own standards and ideas of having fun and that's fine. Life's too short to seek validation from people. Do whatever the hell you want to ;)
1	i can totally relate to this!
4	Are dead bodies sacred?	A lot of people will agree that humans should have complete control over their own bodies while they are alive. How about after death? Is it better to use those bodies (for organ donation etc.) for the benefit of the living?\nShould there be an opt-out instead of opt-in for organ donation? How about in tricky situations where the person died really early before deciding?
1	Sacred? No. But you've got to handle them with respect of course. I reckon an opt-out scenario is best. Many people don't think about whether they want to be an organ donor, some do but are indifferent or just too lazy to change their registration and others don't want to think about it because they are scared. Family is often faced with this question when a relative dies who has not registered and many people say no, some say yes, but many people regret their decision afterwards. No wonder, because making such an enormous decision on someone else's behalf in such a turbulent moment is impossible. \n\nSo, making organ donation a default for people over 18 or 21 because of all these reasons, and more, is a good thing, I would say. It forces people to face this question and to make a conscious decision. I think that is good. We need donated organs so we can't just keep on not registering for whatever reason. Do it to save other people or to spare your loved ones such a difficult choice, or spare the doctors having to ask your family. And please, don't feel guilty if you don't want to be an organ donor. That's your every right. Put please register so as to make things clear and to prevent chaos after your death. That helps everybody.\n\nI would also make underage people organ donors by default, and let parents or guardians change this to a no if they or the child are uncomfortable with this. Children are of course an even more touchy subject, but child organs are in even greater need than adult organs because adult organs simply are too big for children. And, child organ donations are just the most important because we can give these kids their childhood and possibly their whole life back.
1	I think bodies should be handled with respect, but I do think that the organ donor aspect should really be an opt-out kind of thing. If they died and didn't opt-out, donate. Even then, most bodies are not apt to donate depending on the cause of death. \n\nMyself, I'd like to be buried in the ground under a seed or something. Go back to nature, not buried in an expensive box wearing expensive clothes and makeup, or toasted to become toxic ash. It makes no sense.
5	Do you like to follow a routine?	I like to make a time table to list things I have to do daily.\n\nI end up procrastinating anyway but it is better than not having a routine.\n\nAnyone?
14	I make so many to-do lists and schedules and plans for myself, and I never follow through. I think it's because I never feel like I have enough energy, I'm like a human-shaped sloth. 
5	I just keep the list of the things I have to do in my mind and do them whenever I feel like it. (Although I also procrastinate a lot lol so it may take time)
3	nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1	i wouldn't say i 'like' to follow a routine but i DO make up a list of things i need to do in my mind - to make up for being disorganized. because otherwise i won't get anything useful done. i'll just procrastinate (and i still do even with a list in mind). but to answer from what i feel like inside, i feel quite held back when i need to follow a routine/list/etc. so no i don't really like to follow a routine!
1	If routine means getting up from bed, brushing your teeth, eating breakfast, going to school, procrastinating on homework, doing said homework late at night, and staring at the clock until midnight, then yes, I do follow a routine.\n\nIf you mean a reasonable routine, then I'm not the right person to follow.
11	When under distress, what are you like?	**A)** I replay past memories in my head and regret or become ashamed of them.\n\n**B)** I think of future possibilities and dread them.\n\nIf other, please describe in comments. Thanks.
3	B
3	I turn into a really cold calculated person. Aside from that, A. I am not organized enough to be thinking about the future, and I kind of like it that way.
2	I become a super bitch. A super moody super bitch. I guess I'm more so B though because when i'm in this mood I tend to be thinking about how bleak the future could be.
2	I procrastinate. It helps numb out my emotions. Then I isolate from the whole world in the corner of my room.
2	C- escapism
9	this is one of those getting-stuff-off-my-chest posts, please ignore if you're looking for useful advice.	I did the personality test on that 16personalities website (since it appeared the most attractive/professional) and tested as ISFP(-T) 4 separate times over the course of a week. I'm new at this but I decided to reach out to the inter-webs since I haven't tried this method yet, here goes nothing.\n\n\nI've been in a little bit of a (well kinda big) rut recently since entering the university system last year, I still have no idea what I want to do although I definitely know what I don't or wouldn't like to do in the future (e.g. definitely not mechanical engineering or the sciences). I used to be interested in film (fueled by my enjoyment from making YouTube videos for fun) but that kind of died off, just like my interest for business studies/commerce. I've been attempting programming during my time in university, but recently that has been dwindling too. It's not like I am failing horribly at those subjects, in fact i'd say i'm doing decently; it's just that I find it really hard to justify doing something if I don't enjoy it (for an extended period of time). I started to notice and acknowledge that my work ethic revolves around random bursts of high energy and motivation whenever I find something I am genuinely interested in whether it be a subject, a hobby or even something as minuscule as shooting a basketball, I would literally dedicate my entire life towards that activity and become the most efficient and hard-working person that I personally know of. But as a result, if nothing ignites me or interests me in the first place, I procrastinate (a lot), lose motivation and as of recently, start questioning whether I made the right choice in choosing media as my major. I am jealous that many of my friends found their place at their unis and seem to be excelling in their fields and healthily developing as an individual, finding internships and what-not, getting fit and healthy, making money etc. And here I am again, wondering what went so wrong.\n\n\nWhy can't I handle stress and/or bite the bullet like my friends? Why do I mentally and physically crumble under (the smallest amounts of) stress? Why do I procrastinate so much even though I know that I can physically do a certain task?  Why am I always unsatisfied and anxious? Those are probably some of the questions I google every night before I worry myself to sleep (am I even an ISFP?). It's just so depressing thinking about this stuff but I feel if I were to suppress these feelings, they would probably creep up on me in the future. I tried sharing with friends and family, but they don't seem to fully understand (comprehend), maybe because I am bad at explaining what's going on inside my head, or they're not taking me seriously. Every time I try to explain the struggle i'm going through (especially to elders) I get the "you're not in the workforce yet, so just get good grades" talk. I understand that they might have gone through the college experience and found some secure 9-5 job that pays good money, but that doesn't mean I should subject myself to that same path (of torture) doing something I have no interest in, come out working some random job which I will hate for the next 20 years only to say "I hate myself". \n\n\nSpeaking of hate, I sometimes hate how emotionally sensitive/weak I am. Maybe I can attribute that to my weak strength (relative to the world) so I can't exactly put up a fight, nor do I want to since I know I'll lose. Or my mental capabilities, especially the ability (inability in this case) to keep up my side of a verbal argument, it seems to always get to a point where I start realizing where I might be wrong and then I implode; so I feel that unless I am 100% correct I cannot win (I usually lose in those arguments too since the other person tends to arrogantly think they are correct anyway). I don't exactly have high self-esteem nor the willpower to just will it to existence like my brother did. Don't get me wrong, I do have willpower, but it just comes and goes at the worst of times; I'd go out my way to spend time with a friend if they are in need, but I just can't get started on that essay.\n\n\nI've been told many times that I view things too much in black and white, ones and zeroes, and that I take things way too seriously/personally (even social interaction), but habits are hard to break right? I have no idea what the solution is, I doubt it can be found through a simple google search. I have tried taking things less seriously and become more lenient to halfway points (not winning 100% of the way, at least I put in effort sort of thing), but it seems during moments of high stress (work or play) I throw all that out the window whenever things are going south and it's back to square one. It almost feels like I let my guard down and as a result I let the result slip. A common example would be: while I am playing games I relax a little and enjoy the game with a few friends. Then some random player on my team says that I suck (usually after a round loss); the casual match then becomes some personal mission for me to do everything I can to prove him/her wrong so I can rub it in their face later (not verbally of course). This puts a lot of stress on something that is meant to be a relaxing activity. The thing is, I know that it's not a healthy thing to do, but I do it impulsively (explosively) and usually I can't control it although I am aware of my actions. It usually ends badly as I tend to set impossible expectations for myself but still be disappointed if I don't reach them. \n\n\nI probably said enough, I could go on for ages but I doubt fellow redditors would want to read such a long post (especially if it's a rant). I don't really expect much from this post, nor do I know what response I want to see (just like how I don't know what I expect my family or friends to say after hearing my rants), but at least I got it out.
3	Meditation is the answer.
3	Hey, I'm so sorry you are going through all this. I have four kindof points that I would have screamed at myself five years ago when I was in university, so I guess I'll now take the opportunity to volley them at you...\n\n1). Depression/anxiety/existential crises during college are common and, sadly, normal. Remember that this is a stage in your life. It is not the only one, and honestly is not even the most important one (although it feels like it because... You're in it). I was SHOCKED to read some of my personal writing from college, just three years out. It was full of unbridled and *casual, flippant rage*. I feel none of that now.\n\n2). Some schools and departments are better about this than others... College is not a competition. You and your classmates are all in this together. Reach out to people you feel jealousy towards; they may actually share insecurities with you or tips and tricks to accomplish the same thing. Put your finger on which direction your department leans (competition between students or community) and strive, strive for community. Nobody is as secure and put together as they would like you to think. You are NOT the only one struggling with x, y or z, not by a long shot. The more healthy friendships and networks you have, the more chance you have of a successful friend extending an opportunity to you which could not have been attained otherwise. If you think you can be successful on your own... You are dead wrong. I missed a lot of opportunities right out of the gate because I was such a lone wolf. \n\n3). Counseling is generally available depending on the university. Please, please look into it; it will help you analyze how your opinion of yourself affects your opinion of others. It is always more helpful to describe your situation to a human being sitting right in front of you than to a disembodied "community" on Reddit. You made a post; you're aware you need help; please seek it from a source that can really HELP.\n\n4). If it's hard to settle on a career path, perhaps speak with a professor who meant a lot to you this past year/taught a great class. It may be they have some insight into your strengths and weaknesses and may be able to direct you. It's possible that particular subject appeals to you, in which case... Keep on it.\n\n5). I lied, there are five points. Snuggle a cat.
1	I used to be this way but a little bit less extreme. What helped for me was 1. Maturity 2. Discovering my personality type 3. Taking intellectual classes with a good professor (English, sociology, etc.) 4. Learning to relax. \n\nThe world isn't running away from you so why try to be a step ahead of fate. Once I discovered my personality type and what parts of me I was suppressing through classes and stress I started becoming a Very relaxed person. \n\nI know this is anecdotal but I feel like this could strongly help you.\n\nStart off by taking the time each day to relax, listen to some relaxing music, maybe research something. Your brain will take you the rest of the way. \n\nGood Lord I sound like a hippie.
1	I also get overwhelmed when stressed, i freeze and i struggled a lot in my studies due to this. I got counselling and just got some relaxation techniques aswell as stratagies to deal with  stressful situations. \n\nI also understand what you mean with the sensitivity. I am very emotional and unfortunately the world does not think it is "manly", but it does not help that you become anger about it. I had to just accept it, i dont flaunt it but im not ashamed of it. \n\nThen a good way to be more mentally healthy is to be physically healthy, also (this is going to sound horrible but) get a routine or time table for the day and stick to it. This helped me when i was stressed and didnt want to do anything. I use never study and was distracted by anything (i use to make tracks for track mania for hours). \n\nHope this helps, welcome to ask questions. Oh and we are all friendly and helpful here. 
1	I relate completely to everything you said. I tested the same as you on 16 personalities, and I was in your boat back when i was in college (even now, too). I felt like i existed in a constant state of apathy and indecisiveness, unable to focus on tangible goals and unable to get myself excited for anything. Sometimes my reactions to things are plagued by anxiety or impulse, making me feel untrue to myself.\n\nRecently I've been googling all I can about my type, and found some ideas that helped me understand myself a lot better. If you can, read up on the functions of the mbti types and isfps. I found that I was in something called the Introverted feeling, introverted intuition loop (Fi-Ni loop). Basically i lived inside my head, letting my fears, doubts, emotions run rampant. But isfps are sensation driven people, and in order to get out of this, I learned that i had to get back in touch with the world by doing things, going places, seeing, touching, feeling. The comments that mention meditation are good advice. Learn to clear your head and become present in the moment. Using your extraverted sensing (Se) will feel very much like this and help you feel more focused and aware. This felt like the missing piece of the puzzle for me. I started reading more books recently, and it's expanded my mind and given me topics to talk about. I realized a lot of anxiety and stress stemmed from not knowing things outside of my own mind, which lead to me being unsure of myself. But the more i put myself out there to see and learn new things, the more confident i felt because i knew that i had the experience to back it up. Some things might take time and growing up before it becomes apparent, such as finding your career niche and passion. But set goals for yourself and start doing them. Honestly, life is just you running new iterations until you settle somewhere you like, so it's okay if you don't always get things right the first time.\n\nIt's been a few years out of college, and i don't think I've ever been more sure of myself, but it's not perfect by any means. I've felt significantly better within the past few weeks alone by compulsively learning about isfps. Part of it was just being able to identify some things i've felt were missing but never understood. If you like podcasts, Personality Hacker has some good topics pertaining to your type as well as others. I like thinking of mbti as your stats/class in the game of life, and when reframed in this way, all i wanted to do is to level up and get better at what i am. Anyway, apologies for the long response, i just really resonated with what you posted. Good luck!
1	Thanks for sharing, I relate a lot.
6	ISFPs good at programming/data analysis/excel?	Never learned but wondering how much of a drag it would be
8	I have a career in GIS and losing myself in tedious data problems is one of my favourite parts about my job. It allows me to creatively problem solve and to not have to talk to anyone for long periods of time. 
1	Im not at all. 
1	I have two jobs currently. For one I automate excel reports and the other I'm building websites and databases with coding languages like PHP, JavaScript and HTML.\n\nIt's a drag if you let it be a drag. But if you think of it with a more creative mindset then it helps!
1	I think that i'm ISFP and i love these data graphs and things related to that, i also like programming, i haven't learned it yet but i find it very interesting, specially AI.
57	Does anyone else feel like they're constantly in this cycle?

7	Gotta get off the internet and do something else... ugh, I'm bored with that... what can I find on the internet?
4	All day erry day
2	Befriend an ENTJ, they're organized *and* impulsive.
3	ISFP detailed profile by Zamanskaya (Socionics ESI "Dreiser")	
2	It says ISFj though...?
8	How do you move on?	How do you let go when the person you have feelings for doesn't feel the same?
12	I have internal agony whenever I think about them. I only really move on when I found someone else. 
4	When you like someone, you look at them with rose-tinted glasses, take those off and take a step back. Try to think about the situation from a 3rd person perspective, what would you tell someone/your friend who comes to you for advice regarding a similar situation? Anyway, the same words are what you should be telling yourself, write them down somewhere and read it whenever necessary. This helps you think more objectively as you detach yourself from the issue and there's articles on this which you can search up if you want to read more. 
2	I go on a trip in seclusion with my dog. Once I drove to a small mountain town in Colorado with my dog Ares and spent 5 days hiking and swimming in hot springs and living in my truck. Another time I moved to California with nothing for 3 months and realized how much life there sucked. Maybe going through a bit of roughness puts things in perspective? I also found someone new pretty soon after both times
2	Moving on from someone is one of the most difficult things to do, at least it was for me. You always want to cling on to that shred of hope that you'll be with them. But sometimes you just have to make the decision to let go. I've found that starting a new hobby, or even making new friends, away from that individual really helps. As an introvert, putting yourself out there like that can be scary, but in the long run it really does wonders. I realize that I'm saying the same thing as everyone else on here, but from personal experience, it really does work. Eventually you'll find yourself thinking about them less and less everyday, and then one day you won't think about them at all.

1	I (M 42)have this same problem.. moving on when the person doesn't feel the same is difficult. I think it's difficult for most people but it seems more difficult for me. \n\nAfter my last breakup that was just one of those life-changing type events, I took a long look at myself and my identity when I "finally" buy in to a relationship. I realized I let the relationship become part of my identity instead of being a separate person within the relationship. So if the relationship failed and it had morphed into my identity then what did that mean for me? Like I said, lot of internal inventory type stuff had to happen. \n\nI remember during that last one complaining to a friend that "I had let this person in" and all these "things" happened. I realized that I can count on 2 fingers the times I had a relationship get anywhere close to me, so if one gets past those levels of seperation then it's gonna be a tough out if it falls apart. I'm not entirely sure if that's my ISFP/ADHD or just how I'm put together.. \n\nLetting go and realizing everytime (in retrospect) it was absolutely for the best helps immensely 
14	I quit my job and have all the time in the world, but i'm still miserable	I invested wisely when I was younger and saved up a lot of money from my job straight out of college. As a "starving artist" type, I quit my job because I felt 40 hours a week was just too much. Wake up early tired as fuck, commute on a ghetto bus for almost an hour, go to work, talk to people through messenger only, commute back on a bus, walk my dog, cook dinner and relax, by then I have maybe an hour to do my hobbies, but I usually go to the gym since it's pretty much necessary. What the fuck? I can't believe this is how people live. On weekends I usually have to grocery shop, get my car fixed, take my dog to the vet, go to the gym, or have a social life for a friday/saturday night. By then, I STILL have no time for my hobbies.\n\nI want to learn how to skateboard, make music, play more instruments, volunteer, travel, build my own house eventually, start my own business, meet new people, join gymnastics, lift, join an orchestra, learn to cook better, make funny videos for Youtube. Etc etc etc.\n\nSo, I quit my job. I have enough money to live a year or two without working. Believe it or not, I STILL don't have enough time to do all this!! It's the most frustrating thing in the world. I recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree last month, so I thought okay, this will free some time up, but no, there's always SOMETHING. \n\nMy typical day is wake up, shower, walk my dog, go to the gym, by then it's time to make some food, so I do that and dick around on Reddit for a while. Then either my friends want to hang out or I go to the skatepark or play piano, then it's time for dinner. I eat and catch up on Youtube subscriptions. I go to the gym. Dog needs another walk. By now it's about midnight, day is done. It NEVER seems like enough time! I want to do everything. This is what a day looks like when nothing urgent comes up, such as car needs to go to the shop or friend is having a panic attack or sister wants to call and catch up for a couple hours. \n\nI'm wondering if any other ISFPs feel this way, like there's just never enough time. I also hate it when people ask what I do for a living because I never know what to say! I just want to live without a job for a while, is that so wrong? It bothers me that people work to live and live to work, but even if we didn't work there's just not enough time to do what I love.
10	Ugh you have NOOOO idea how much I relate to this. I loathe working 40 hours at a tedious job, sorting at a desk all day. But I know if I actually had that free time, I'd use it sleeping in and goofing off on the internet instead of being productive, unless some outside force makes me do something else. I have serious self motivation issues when there's no sense of urgency to get things done.
5	That's because the problem was never your job. It was your perception and your priorities. I know that because I made the same mistake you did. \n\nYou have your whole life to do anything you want. Saying that there's not enough time is bullshit. Just get started on ONE thing for now and enjoy the ride.
2	I guess you're going to have to prioritize what's important, and start saying no to some of those unexpected things that come up.\n\nI've been without a job for 7 years, and even the last one I had was part time. I make passive income online.\n\nEven so, if I let it, things could steal my time if I'm not careful. I had to learn to say no. My phone is always on silent. I turned off most notifications.\n\nNow I'm so lazy some days I just chill outside and watch the birds all day. Time management is still an issue for me too, but I don't like to beat myself up for not being "productive enough".
2	I'm one letter different from your type, but still:\n\n* "It NEVER seems like enough time!" - there is no other solution as to say no to some things and to intentionally set time for the things you truly want.\n\n* Top content in /r/getmotivated and /r/getdisciplined subreddits can help. For example, [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/?st=j4ffeqkc&sh=27e30648). \n\n* And you can post your daily/weekly/monthly plans in [special threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/search?q=%5Bplan%5D+author%3Awalls&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=month) in /getdisciplined (the link is there in the sidebar) - at the end of the period you get asked by the moderator how did it go. All 4 things _(figuring out your list of goals/habits to practice, sharing it publicly, a deadline, and having someone ask your how did you do)_ have a sobering and motivating effect. \n\n* It seems, there are no strong motivators for you to progress in doing/learning what you want (no need to make money, show off, etc.), so what can help is setting up systems, not goals:\n\n1. Figure out your aspirations and what daily habits will automatically ensure you achieving/learning what you want. \n\n2. Just build those habits. It takes times of course, and there are some guidelines - start small (a short list of small habits - 5min / 1 pomodoro / etc.), use positive wordings, try to stick new habits before/after your existing solid habits or group new habits into morning/evening routines, etc. 
1	I can relate a lot. My job had recently become more seasonal, meaning I have weeks off at a time and I should be either finding a new job, learning a new skill or being productive at home. I find myself instead reading books and enjoying the peace and quiet of my home and can't find the time to do anything at all productive. \n\nI find planning a trip or event puts the pressure on me enough to start working on things that aren't the daily grind. I also have recently scheduled gym classes for the time I would normally be going into work, once I'm out I find things to do, but if I stay home - it turns into a hermit day.  \n\nI have no real advice, just I feel ya..
1	I strongly suggest doing some meditation
1	At this point in my life, I would much rather be working an office job and being busy that having tons of free time. When I was unemployed I got depressed, tired, bored, I actually ended up doing less. I don know my life's purpose but I know I'm not going to find out by having more time, only through experiences and trying new things, and as an isfp it's hard for me to take initiative on my own.
1	Make a routine.\n\nOr at least allocate a few hours per day for your hobbies and only proceed to do other things after that.
6	How do you guys view ENTPs?	My best friend is one and he got me into MB. He thinks most types see them as assholes. What do you think?
4	My brother is an ENTP and we get into a lot of debates, from the smallest things (I tell him knob is broken, he tells me it's not, I tell him I just tested, he says he used it and its fine, I tell him go and test it, he says it must be this and that) to really serious things (I advise him not to take a full load of classes this semester at uni, he tells me he signed up for the easy ones, I tell him it will still eat up his time, he tells me he can do this and that). He often debates me to death and will not accept being the wrong person in the conversation and will try to find loop holes so that he can emerge as the victor. He even twists my words sometimes and claims I said something that I didn't, and will claim that the context in how I said it was misleading, that's why I'm wrong. \n\n\n\nDespite all of that, I love my brother and he's a good companion. I never had difficulties asking him to do errands. He agrees to go with me whenever I need help doing something. He is loved by many of his friends. We have so many inside jokes. We enjoy watching movies together and talking about it afterwards. He's one of my closest friends and he tolerates me when I want to relax and act like we are kids again (water pistol fight, playing games with our dog, running around the house like crazy, etc). Plus, I must admit, he is intelligent. I just hate how I lose logical arguments with him :P
3	I have always wanted to meet an ENTP. I think we would get along great...I am into ENTJs but there's just something too different about them for us to ever perfectly mesh. I wonder if that would be fixed with a J to P switch.
5	[deleted]
3	My boyfriend of 2.5 years is an ENTP. He can definitely come across as an asshole at times but there's a lot more to him than that. 
2	never met one either! we're too quiet and we don't get noticed by them. I imagine that we'd get intimidated by them. Ni is slow and Ne is fast, which would probably make us look stupid/ boring to them. Quicksilver from the recent X-Men movies (Evan Peters) and Tyrion from GOT reminds me of what ENTPs would be like. I actually had a crush on Quicksilver and Tyrion, too.
17	Anyone else have trouble with obsessing over a new love interest?	Like thinking about them All The Time. I took a good year off dating to focus on myself after my last relationship and got to a good place - self sufficient and generally happy. Got back in the game recently and met someone who checks all the boxes.. all of a sudden they're on my mind all the time, next comes the insecurity and self doubt, then the awkwardness that will push them away. \n\nAnyone have any advice? Trying to trick my brain with distractions and self affirmations but it's a losing battle.
18	Yes this happens a lot to me. Like you idealize that person, it's not even based in reality, it's your fantasy of the perfect partner. I don't know how to stop the obsession but you should understand manifestation and that actively desiring it repels it away. Act/believe/have the attitude that you already have all the things you want. It's kinda crazy but it shifts your mindframe and might make you feel better. Also, if you're feeling doubts/insecure about a romantic interest, I would just leave it alone. Your potential partner should want you just as much as you want them and shouldn't make you feel insecure about it, but reassure you and provide the affection and love us ISFPs can so easily provide.
9	I accidentally deleted my comment :/ but yes! Currently obsessing over someone for the longest time now. We fall for people who we think are better than us at everything
4	Damn peeps! Wish we could hold ourselves at the high value we do others. It comes in flashes but hard to hold onto. 
4	Not even a love interest but a friend interest will take up a lot of my thoughts. I'll go in with such confidence and then worry that I will start pushing them away with my obsessive nature - which in turn can seem stand offish, it's a real struggle to make new, close friends. 
5	Always. Not even that new anymore and im still obsessing. Trick is to find someone that obsesses over you as well. Hahaha. No it helps if you know that they are obsessed and tgus intern want you to feel the same they do, which you do so its all good. Anyway I know its hard and I always just embraced that part of me and if that pushed tge other person away you should reevaluate and decide if it is really worth the emotional effort. Never change! Feel passionate! Its not abnormal.

1	not ISFP, but definitely yes
12	Why this sub makes me realize how lonely being a introvert is.	Being a introvert I am generally pretty bad at making friends. I can see this throughout my life. While I don't wish to be friends with probably 90% of the people I meet, that letter "f" still persists. Funny how we long for feeling and expression when our social skills are inherently weak and clumsy. Yeah I dont want a lot of friends, but even with the two or three good ones I have right now I still feel lonely. I stared working retail last year and made good friends with my coworkers and that really improved my social skills. I think I've reached the point in my life where that "f" is taking over and making me very emotional about not having a girlfriend and honestly a wife. Call me crazy but this maturity thing hit me like a truck. I am a different man than who I was two years ago. Here I am talking to a bunch of people I don't know much about other than a common personality type just because I want that sense of having some close to talk to. Thanks for being my wife reddit. Yes I know I'm insane, but that's the card I was dealt.
3	I feel this way too :( love can be a distraction though. If you look over at the exfx forums, they pine over an imagined other half too. Even the thinkers do this. So at least you're not alone at feeling lonely
3	>[...] and making me very emotional about not having a girlfriend and [...] a wife. \n\nDon't be greedy, most of us would be content with either a gf or a wife :-D \n\n...Sorry. Regarding social skills, there's a lot of advice flying around along the lines of "fake it till you make it", "assume rapport", etc. Amazingly, all of it is true. Just practice acting like you're an extrovert, and it becomes a skill you can pull off with relative ease when you need it. \n\n(The difference to actually *being* an extrovert is that you still have to actively make the choice to put in an effort, I think.) 
3	I don't really feel this way. I'm an introvert, and I'm bad at starting conversations and making friends, but I practice anyway. I don't want to be friends with 90% of the people I meet, but when I meet someone who has stuff in common with me, I put myself out there. [Being vulnerable](https://markmanson.net/power-in-vulnerability) is scary but it pays off.\n\nI've also been happily single for the last 4 years. I might get into a relationship if I really find someone compatible, but for now just sharing a house with my two flatmates and having a few really great close friends is more than enough for me to be happy. Invest in yourself. Friends and wives come and go, but you have to live with yourself for your whole life. 
2	Isfp conversation	Hey, I've been trying to become friends with an isfp girl recently, and I've been having trouble. Everytime I bring up something hoping to continue the conversation, she responds with really short answers, and the convo stops. I'm an infp girl. Am I doing something wrong?
5	You are trying to force the convo. If that makes sense. I also do this sometimes. Just give it time. Im speaking for myself here: I do that aswell, I usually take a little while to warm up to people and then I can talk easily. And sometimes I just dont want to talk to people so then the convo just dies, and its not just people I dont feel comfortable with but everyone. \n\nSo just give it time, hang out, maybe try do an activity with her. 
4	Why not invite them out for an activity? that way you get our adventurous spirit going, it's easier to chat when part of our attention is doing something physical, and you have common interests.
3	One very important tip that I learnt. Never speak over an ISFP!  It seems to be their number one pet peeve! Listen attentively, and always wait for them to finish. They will appreciate it, and will be encouraged to talk more!
1	Consider the ladder of abstraction:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9IXPZfswNw\n\nMaybe try bringing the topic of conversation more to the here and now, the concrete and less abstract.
3	Isfp x infp	For the past couple months, I've become good friends and developed romantic feelings for a girl with the isfp personallity type. I'm a male infp, and I've thought so much about asking her out, but everywhere I look, people talk about hoe incompatable isfp and infp relationships are. I don't often buy into stuff like that, but it's still fairly doscouraging. Should I put in time into the relationship, or are these type of personalities so incompatible that it's not worth the time?
14	Just go for it 
4	Go for it, life is about living and experiencing. Don't live in regret :)\n\nalso we find you infps sooo romantic, it would be lovely!
1	Hi\nI know your post is old but I’m in the same boat myself, f/INFP to a m/ISFP. \nOut of curiosity, did things work out? I kinda wanna tell him I like him but idk what to do. If you don’t I understand. Good luck!
7	What Each Personality Type Thinks of Physical Appearance	
4	Isfps, do you tend to get lost in thought?	Just wondering.
11	Yeah but I seem to just space out without thinking just as much
2	The other day I was at lunch and I spaced out with a open water bottle in my hand and dropped the water. it wasn't a good day overall, though.
2	[deleted]
2	Yes, all the time really. But, it's hard to tell if it's being an ISFP alone or more of my ADD kicking in.
2	Often..sometimes labeled as anti-social or weird because when i'm socializing im really on but then ill hermit often too
4	What sort of college did you go to?	I'm a rising senior in high school and I was wondering what sort of factors (size, major, vibe of the place, etc) made you choose the college you did. Are you happy with the college you went to or do you regret it? I'm just a formless blob not knowing what the hell I'm doing and could use a little guidance. 
3	Lmao didn't go. I totally respect the dedication it takes to go to college but, for me personally I'm not going thousands upon thousands of dollars into debt and throwing away 4 years of my life just so I can find out what I don't want to do with the rest of it, y'know? Not saying this is everyone's experience, but I can tell it would be mine. I love learning and I love knowledge but I'm in the "knowledge should be free or understandably priced" camp and right now it (university I mean) just isn't.
2	I'm two grades above you, I went to a small liberal arts college called St Olaf for a semester before dropping out. I hated it. Really really make sure that when you pick a school, you take a good a look at the culture of the school. Make sure you like the extracurriculars and the town it's in, cause the vast majority of your time is not gonna be spent in class or studying.  
2	Absolutely loved my college. I think the most important factor was visiting just to be on campus and get a feel for what it's like there. I was thinking in terms of "this is where I'm going to live for the next 4 years, I should make sure it feels like home and I'll fit in here." \n\nI also didn't have any idea what major I wanted to pursue, so that wasn't a factor for me. If you have something specific in mind that you want to study, that's obviously very important. I chose a school with a wide range of options so I'd be sure they had something I was interested in whenever I did decide.\n\nEDIT: You mentioned in another comment that you're shy (as a lot of us ISFPs probably are). Maybe ask about the schools' orientation programs. Mine was amazing and created an environment where I was super comfortable meeting people. My dorm was really tight-knit as a result and I'm still best friends with some of those people. I think that made a huge difference where I otherwise would've struggled to make friends.
1	I chose my college based on a couple factors. It needed to be well within my range of standards because it costs a lot of time and investment of money once you make the commitment. I had already decided I wanted to go to a top public university within my state anyway, so applying my selection of choices was easy enough. I got rejected by the most prestigious ones, accepted by the ones next in line, and waitlisted by others. At that point I just had to pick out of the ones that accepted me (since waitlisting couldn't guarantee me a spot), and from then on it was a matter of visiting the campuses, seeing what they're like, and then determining which one I felt most comfortable going to.  \n  \nA point to make: if you have any specific major or career in mind, make sure they have good programs or departments at the university. I was undecided so it wasn't a particularly big issue for me, but since I had chosen to go to a prestigious research university I ended up closing off possible routes you might have found in other types of higher education (community college, trade school, etc.). Animation was one of the things I was interested in pursuing, but I crossed that possibility off once I decided upon the university I ended up attending.  \n  \nAs for what my university's like, it's quite big (30,000 students) but it wasn't a big deal for me since I was used to attending a large middle school and high school of an average of 3,000 (I had grown up in a major city). Meeting fresh new people every day made things fun and interesting. The college town is very safe, and I enjoy being able to walk around at night without feeling afraid (again, grew up in a major city so I normally wouldn't do that at all). However, it can be a little boring because it's so safe, so it's up to the students' preferences on what they want the vibe to be like. I personally didn't mind since I usually spend my free time indoors anyway instead of going out lol.  \n  \nLastly: I don't particularly regret going to the school, but I don't particularly find myself attached to it either. It depends on your own view of the college experience: are you treating it more like a business to get it over with and get your degree? Or are you there for the life itself and looking to make lots of good memories? I was initially the latter, but ultimately ended up as the former.  \n  \nCollege is a life changing experience no matter what, so you take away from it what you can. I had good financial aid (with the mistake of deciding to dorm because I personally did not have a good experience with it *and* am now stuck with loans thanks to that...), so to me overall it was a positive experience. I now made myself more marketable in the job field because I attended a well known college, and I have plenty of relatable/college stories to tell all the new people I meet.  \n  \nSorry for the long post but there's my 2 cents! Hope that helps you out :)
1	I went to the university my dad went to. I wasn't leaning to a particular university (was lost and had no idea what I wanted to do..). The only thing I would change looking back is I would have gone to a university different from my hometown. My uni was full of snobs.
1	My friends and family pressured me to at least take some online classes. I had no idea what I wanted to do at the time and was working full time in a fast food kitchen. I was interested in computers at the time so I went into IT. I think I did 1 lesson realized that this is retarded and just like the bs busy work I had to do in high school and never logged back in. \n\nSo for an entire semester I convinced my parents I was still taking the class. I got some emails from the school asking if I was still attending and just ignored them. I figured I was out a grand and just wouldn't go back next semester. Then one day I got a check in the mail returning the majority of my money. Well my parents were kinda pissed about me lying but they understood not wanting to waste money on something I wasn't 100% sure about. \n\nSo I continued working fast food, became the best grill guy at the busiest of 4 other restaurants in our chain in my city. Then I quit and became a 2nd shift lead at a small local manufacturing plant in less then 4 months. I get to be in charge of run a cnc router. Basically it's like being a computer tech+mechanic. Its fun and has lots of hands on stuff plus troubleshooting. I love it so far. It's kinda weird though because it's just me and 2 other guys at night, and Im new enough still that I generally have zero idea what I'm doing. It's all trial and error. I love it.\n\nTLDR I dropped out cause I didn't have any idea what I wanted to do. Found a job I enjoyed. Better than college.
6	How Would You Best Explain And Describe Your Type (ISFP) To A Person Who Knows Nothing About Myers-Briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ISFP personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
9	Usually I start off by explaining functions. Then I often offer examples from my life to illustrate Fi and Se. Each of our functions are filtred through Fi. Our Ni and Te are good examples of the flawed versions of these functions.\n\nFi - I am constantly aware of myself and constantly wondering if I am doing the right thing, if I am being supportive enough, if I am being interesting enough. It takes a lot of place. Fi also makes us FEEL what is right and what is wrong. It is subjective, therefore it can be wrong, and since it's just a deep feeling, it can be hard to understand, even for yourself. It also makes me feel for individuals. It makes me aware of individuals and their feelings rather than social conventions. Since Fi is about values and morality, it's what makes us want to be good and supportive people. Sometimes we don't have the words to help, but we always want to help. Especially the people we love. It can make us self-sacrificing, but since it's an ebb-and-flow function, it can also make us very cold at times, when we feel betrayed.\n\nSe - Combined with Fi, it makes me aware of every single person around me. But it's also what naturally prevents me from going for conflict or words that could make someone sad, especially when facing the person, because I will feel how hurt someone can be. (we are tuned both to people's feelings and our environment) Se also makes me observant of sensory details. It enables me to enjoy going for a run, sports and beauty in nature for itself. It's a good, objective counterpart to Fi. It allows me to be nonjudgmental and to appreciate all the differences and qualities in each person. Fi+Se make us naturally good with art, because it gives us a good sense of a beauty that can convey perfectly our feelings, without having to put words on it. None of our main functions are functions of language, which is why we have trouble putting our thoughts into words. Art is our way out. It's also the reason why we love animals and children. They are simple beings that are not molded and repressed by society or morality itself.\n\nNi - It allows me to link things to get to a conclusion. Since it's not especially good, it can both be too idealistic or too negative, depending on my mood. It makes me see a future way too bright or way too dark. For example, I tend to idealize people I just get to know based on little information I have of them. I extrapolate, often in a wrong way. If I do not sort things out with Se, that is, with external, objective data, I also tend to be extremely negative about myself and my future. Se is very important for us as it helps us make sure we are making concrete moves to be morally good people according to our standards. Ni is ONE conclusion. It's because of this function that we can make the wrong conclusions about what people think of us. (One of my best friends is ISFP and sometimes she is sure I am mad at her or I am sure she is sad when really none of this is happening. Most of our conflicts happen because of misunderstandings. I also get mad about her not talking things out when I see her being in a bad mood or because she did not ask me to do something out of fear of bothering me even though we've known each other for nearly 10 years; or I explode after keeping something to myself for a long time because I primarly thought I was just interpreting things and then got further proofs for this idea that I could not get off my mind on my own. Then by talking about it I realize it was really just me interpreting things... sigh)\n\nTe - Sometimes I can take the lead and order around, for the sake of efficiency (for not any less than two seconds). Usually though, Te manifests itself when we get angry. When our values are wronged, we can get extremely factual and cold, but since it's a flawed version of Te, filtred through Fi+Ni, our anger can be unjustified and too harsh.\n\nOur biggest challenge is to be able to accept things as they are, others and ourselves. To use Se, accumulate data and experiences, instead of just being constantly in Fi-mode. It's also to force ourselves to communicate about what goes wrong instead of ruminating it by ourselves. \n\nThere you go! Do not hesitate if you have questions. I might have made it sound a little bad because I think it's important for us to face our flaws. But Fi+Se can be awesome ! Because of this combination I love hearing about people's passions or joyful events because I can see how bright it makes them. And I am able to enjoy very specific things about people that make them happy, remember them and use it to make them happy again later ;)
3	The most accurate way to explain about myself as an ISFP is to just show someone a portfolio of art I've made. 
6	Need ISFP relationship advice	I'm an ENTJ,\nOk let me try and make a long story concise here...:\n\nBackground:\nOne of my closest and most long-time friends is an ISFP, we grew up together and were like brothers. A few years ago he got into a really bad downward spiral driven by an adderall (prescription amphetamine) abuse problem. He seemed to be struggling with a lot of paranoid and delusional thoughts and he quit college, work, family and moved into a room in his GF's family's house and played "call of duty" all day for two years. He had surrounded himself with enablers and complacent people.\nI moved back from college to find him in this state and, over a period of about a year and a half, slowly but quite forcefully pushed him to reenter society. In the process I got him a good job at my workplace and he has been adjusting, he's been normal-ish for about 1 year.\nAlthough initially my goal was to rehabilitate him 100%, he seems to be permanently changed from the person he was before the ordeal, and I accept that now for the most part.\n\nNow:\nHowever, in the past 4 months or so, he has started to relapse into irrational and paranoid thinking, and this time the target is me. His belief is that I am "talking gossip" about him and that I constantly hound him for "favors". He will bend or twist any interactions or events to fit as evidence to reinforce this narrative. \n\nFor example:\n-Any time I ask him about something going on in his life (small talk), he gets extremely defensive. Believing I am trying to pry for gossip to tell others.\n-If friends or acquaintances know something about his life, he will interpret that as evidence of my gossiping. (his memory is poor, and often times he was the one that told them, but he forgot).\n-He will bring up a list of 2 small favors he helped me with 1-2 years ago and get really resentful about it. I have stopped asking for anything from him for a long time now. But I can't escape this resentment for these past favors.\n\nOn several occasions now, we've discussed in depth these thoughts and actions, and corroborated with mutual friends that his thinking seems unusual. Each time he seemed to mellow out and start to trust me for a few weeks, only to return back to the irrational thinking.\nAs it stands now, I've decided try to switch strategies and give him space instead. As a result our relationship is basically on a communications blackout for 2 months. However, since I got him a job at my workplace, I still have to interact with him and its very tense and uncomfortable.\n\nI'm not sure if these issues are related to the ISFP type or if it's a sign of mental illness?\n\nCan anyone relate? \nHow can I escape from this zone of scapegoat/ enemy? \nAny advice is very much appreciated. Thanks everyone!\n\nTL;DR\nENTJ with an ISFP friendship falling apart due to irrational suspicion of gossiping and resentment of "favors". plz help
8	He clearly has a personality disorder and most wouldn't relate. And in that case I think it's better to ask people who understand mental health and psychology much better.
5	INFJ here. Married to an ISFP.\n\nMy wife has encountered similar issues, and I personally can't stand how many times I hear "Get her professional help". My response is essentially "No shit!" Trust me, if fixing mental health was as easy as seeing a therapist or taking some pills, we'd all want to be fixed and we'd all immediately seek out those options without hesitation.\n\nBut it doesn't work like that, and this type I notice tends to avoid talk therapy like the plague. ISFP's are stubborn and HATE talking about their problems. They feel cornered and evasive when sitting face to face with someone and are expected to lay out their inner sufferings. And believe me, as someone who loves talking and loves therapy, even under the best circumstances, it doesn't always work so well. To get anything out of therapy, you first have to believe that you WANT it, and you NEED it. If you don't believe yourself, forget it. It's not going to work. And ISFPs are a pain for getting them to change their habits. They look at it like a personal attack on their "individuality" or something. \n\nSorry if I sound a little frustrated, but was actually just on the verge of making my own post. I don't know how anyone in this typing ever fixes themselves when they are broken. They desperately want to do things their own way, which is awesome and wonderful! But when they are doing something that's at their detriment and everyone's around them, they will resist your help, and then when you take a more forceful approach  they will go totally cold on you.\n\nI don't know the answer... and Honestly, if I were to guess, I'd say you just have to take them as they are and do the best you can. For your specific situation. Give your friend space. Forcing him to turn his life around was definitely like... the #1 "no-no" with this type. They'll go along for a little while, but they internalize everything and will eventually go stone cold on you or blow up. Moments like those are a bit scary. Just give them time, and maybe defer to simple gestures of kindness to show you really care about them. ISFPs are surprisingly receptive to these types of things.\n\nAs far as fixing them. It might be best to consider it from another angle. Maybe the problem isn't entirely with them, but perhaps its in your suffocating expectation that they need to act in a way you'd like them to? In your case, as much as you might care for him, he's not your roommate or lover, is he? You have the luxury of space that friendship offers. It can be more easily used to take the good with the bad.
1	Your friends a classic unhealthy type 6
1	sounds a little more like the schizophrenia my mom was diagnosed with this year and she's an ISTJ. So just talk to a metal health specialist honestly. Sorry youre dealing with that. I know it's not fun. Youre a great friend:)
7	Ever feel misunderstood	And unable to explain to people because your original intentions came out wrong and annoyed them and you really want to explain but don't want to bother them and annoy them more than you already have? \nOr maybe it's all in my head? I wish i could just ask her but she'll just think I'm annoying... She just left for work without saying a word 
4	Omfg yes. I just end up explaining to people that my mind doesn't think in language so it's hard for me to communicate. 
3	yea i get it, sometimes words cant explain everything. i also hate when i try to explain something i realized to someone and since its usually like incomprehensible ? they look at me like wtf but ya good luck
2	Yes
1	HELL YES... misunderstood describes my life lol
5	Anxiety and depression makes me feel more like a J than a P	So I'm very certain on the ISF part of my personality type. But I'm really conflicted about the last letter. I have a really hard time making decisions, I like to keep my options open, but at the same time I am constantly fretting about the future and wondering which move I should make next. I have social anxiety, low self esteem, and depression,  but I'm not sure if I'm a Perceiver who over thinks or a judger who doubts herself too much! 
3	Definitely ISFP. An ISFJ would get super stressed out but feel better having everything planned out just so. I have anxiety and avoiding all of that helps me a bit. Like NOT thinking of the future is when I'm relaxed.
12	How do you deal with impulsivity?	I feel like I'm too impulsive in almost every aspect, like i live in autopilot. I feel like spend so much time lost inside my head that I'm not really aware of anything. I can't really remember things clearly, like what I said or what i seen and heard, only an abstract idea of what happened.\n\nI feel like I'm acting on impulse all the time. I dont think before I speak or before I buy something or make decisions. Sometimes, it saves me time, effort and some concerns I don't need, but sometimes (lots of them) they also bring me bad consequences. For example, I realized I'm an impulsive liar. Not all the time, but in some situations where I feel pressured or just only on the bad consequences of telling the truth, I just lie. I know that lying will bring worse consequences in the future, but I do it out of impulse to avoid immediate conflict.\n\nWell, that was one example of how my impulsivity is bringing bad consequences to my life right now, but there are many others. I just want to be more aware of what I say, what I think and what I feel, instead on living in autopilot while I hide in the back of my brain.\n\nDo any of you experience the same thing?  Is it just me or is it an ISFP problem? \nAnd how to deal with it? I think therapy would help, but it's not a viable solution right now.\n\n\nTL;DR: I am an impulsive liar, procrastinator and money spender. How to be more aware of my actions and think before acting? How to stop living in autopilot?
4	Lol, are you me. I think exactly like you, except I don't know if I lie that much, I just try to pull out a vague idea that's in the back of my brain whenever someone asks me a question about myself. I live a lot inside my head too, it's just that my thoughts are hard to translate to people (and I don't think they're that much special anyway). I forget a lot of stuff too. There's too much shit going on inside my brain to properly listen to people sometimes. Sometimes when I listen to people, I forget what they said right away as I'm focusing on the next thing then remember it and reflect upon it later when I'm alone. \n\nOften it's just me living my life, thinking about my thoughts and flaws and trying to find ways to improve, finding them but having no drive to. I do try to be mindful of things but they often slip away, leaving me with the bad consequences. I think scheduling/organizing your life bit by bit can help at least somewhat. But don't get too stressed about it either if it's something outside your control. Enjoy life.
8	Ever feel bored of beauty?	It's such a highly idealized concept..I feel as though it loses its appeal/uniqueness when too much importance and attention is focused on it. Like if I am beautiful, it's not why I want my partner to like me or approach me or focus on. 
6	Agree on the last one, I appreciate beauty but being in a relationship solely because of it would just feel meh. Like they don't want me for me and I'm just a piece of eyecandy for them.
5	No. Beauty comes in many forms, including things some may find ugly or creepy (certain types of art, old abandoned buildings, people who don't fit the ideal because they have features like big noses or unusual facial structures). There's way too much diversity for me to ever feel bored. 
2	I am rather split. While I dislike my partners to like me for my looks, I like them mostly based on looks. But ofc I am male and I grew up in a world where male beauty is considered to be gay or feminine, while for women it's considered the uttermost important thing to have. In my head my brain tells me that male models is the most lousy occupations a male can have. It's worse than cleaning toilets. I know it's not how it is, but my brain and instinct tells me it is. But I don't think I will be bored of Beaty no. But beauty is connected to sexuality. And I hope when I get old and sex lust drops like a stone I will not care anymore:)
10	You guys are really cool	Just wanted to say that you guys are really cool! My best friend is an ISFP and hes one of my most favourite people. Im an INTP and me and him just seem to get on so well. He respects my need for space and he always texts me at night if we had a lot of banter that day to check if i am okay. He's a really good cook and yesterday he was making me pasta and he described the tastes of garlic as musical notes, which to me was crazy but also really interesting.\n\nKeep going you guys because you rock :)
6	Tastes of garlic as musical notes? He sounds cool
3	Thank you!
1	I also like to make nice meals. But I absolutely hate garlic;) I love to get good feedback on my cooking. If I get negative feedback I will stop cooking and call them retards lol. I love praise but I can't take criticism too good. If I get praise I am like an energizer bunny, happy and enthusiastic and everything. If I get criticism I will most likely try to get you out of my life as fast as possible. 
1	Its kinda cool you guys are friends.\n\nApparemtly your types are mirror opposites and its good to see you respect each other and stuff.
4	MBTI Test/Questionnaire	I'm developing an MBTI test but to do this I'll need some people to add to a Discord server, mostly to test questions I may add to the test. If anyone would like to participate you can join the Discord server here:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Q6zjrTd 
27	I'm not an artistic ISFP and I can't stand being labeled as "the artist."	Any post anywhere about an ISFP usually begins by detailing how creative we are. How we have a keen eye for art and are experts at creating masterpieces. However, I have never considered myself an artsy person. My favorite subject in school was not literature (in fact English was my least favorite), and my best drawings feature stick figures. I can appreciate good art but I don't enjoy producing my own work nor do I believe I'm any good at it. Any ISFPs relate? 
15	I always preferred the Adventurer over the Artist.
8	I can relate! I'm a stick figure Picasso, but any more than that and I'm trash at drawing. However, I do enjoy learning Langauges, English included. Like you though, I can appreciate good art and nature around me. Glad to know I'm not alone either! 
9	Isfp are called artists cause we enjoy using our senses externally. I'm an artist but I've always been naturally good at sports and games as I have great hand and eye coordination. \n\nSo if you also enjoy using your hands, eyes, nose, and ears, youre also using your isfp traits in your life. 
4	Yeah I can't draw for shit and I don't really get art. But I do love Literature, I'm currently studying it at University actually. I'm also learning how to code on my own so yeah, forget what other people think. Do whatever makes you happy. 
3	My "art" looks like total garbage and I should not be allowed to even try. I even took a sketching class last year and it was one of the most humiliating experiences I had because we had to show our work to the class. \n\nMy least favourite subject in school (besides math) was English class. You're not alone.
3	Same! I'm undeniably an ISFP but I don't have an artistic bone in my body. 
3	I TOTALLY agree with this, and the label "artist" made me think I must not be ISFP. I have since learned that it's just a poor label.\n\nI will say I love taking in the arts, like listening to music, going to tons of movies, art shows, etc. I'm even a singer in a choir. But if you asked me to CREATE art, that would make me super uncomfortable. I am much more into the mastery of what I'm doing than I am about creating a new way of doing it, which is very much an S trait over an N trait.\n\nI wouldn't say interest in art is an F thing either...but the motivations for taking in art for F types and T types are different. For F types, it's about finding things that enhance beauty and make you feel loved, anything that creates an emotional response. For T types it's more about how does this art influence the world. Not saying that's exclusive to each...that just tends to be the preference. My main point here is that "artist" isn't even necessarily an F thing...there are tons of great T artists throughout history. The artist label is dumb.\n\nAdventurer is way better. I recently bought a camera and just started going to campsites so I could take some cool pictures. But really my goals there are taking in beauty and getting some adventure. 
2	I like art and more an more with age. But it's not only art. I basically love astheticaly beautiful things. But I can't make art at all. But I can do a lot of "house building" etc. I think I have a very creative mind. I am also good in sports. And I love adventure as long as it does not include anything dangerous. I also don't like to travel. My adventure in life has mostly been in the way I consume things around me:)
2	It isn't supposed to be about literal art. It's more about focusing on aesthetics and sensory details. I agree a different name would help though, it tends to confuse new people in the mbti community. I like composer or aesthete  myself.
8	Identity issues as an ISFP	So I thought maybe posting this here would be the best place. I'm an 21F ISFP-T and I'm struggling with some identity issues as I'm a rising senior in college. Mostly this is arising because I want to start a YouTube channel (which is something I've wanted for a number of years). I just don't feel like I really know who I am enough to know exactly what content I should produce. \n\nTo give you an idea of why I want to get started with YouTube, I love producing and editing videos. I don't think anything makes me feel more creatively stimulated since I'm not much of a drawing / painting type of creative haha. I also love the freedom that it would give me. Even if I don't go extremely far to make it a job, it's still so open ended that I could make whatever I wanted / follow whatever schedule I liked. \nBUT despite all that I don't feel like I'm a person who is interesting enough / I'm having a lot of doubt about my abilities both in making videos and in finding a job / career path that interests me enough. \n\nI've heard that isfps tend to go through experimental phases wifh their lives and identies more than other personality types but I just wish I could understand better what I want out of life and who I really want to be. One day I will want one thing and the next I want something else it seems. \n\nThanks for reading. I'd like to know if you experienced something similar and how you could overcome these feelings of being lost with your identity.
4	Ultimately, I feel we don't really have any identity. I think it's always better to just go with the flow.
4	I fight with the same thing. I actually love producing music videos and nothing makes me feel as creatively alive. Literally I can spend an entire day shooting video of the city on my dslr, editing the video and matching it to music with effects and shit. It's such an emotionally involving experience too, like I will completely isolate myself from family and friends and act a little closed off to them when I'm in a creative flow state. Unfortunately, I really don't like the person I become from a social or ethical standpoint when I'm in that zone. Also, it's not a very marketable skill and I also want to a solid income to support my family and do fun things with them so I've chosen a more stable corporate job.\n\nThe thing that helps me the most is realizing that submitting to temperamental weaknesses is not helpful for any personality type. Stop thinking that being an "ISFP" (which literally means that in your default state, you're more likely to act with ISFP tendencies) is limiting you from doing what you want. Even being part of this forum can be a circle jerk of people becoming demotivated to try anything "non-ISFP" like because we think that we should just live comfortably and not push ourselves towards any kind of goal that's important to us. \n\nListen dude, not trying to be condescending or harsh (I almost feel like I'm negotiating with my best and worst self here a little too) but YOU KNOW what you want in life. You look up to people, and resent others, and there is an ideal version of person that you want to be. There's an ideal way you want to be around people, the influence you want to have on them, the feeling your profession gives you, the amount of love you want to feel, the relationship you want to have with nature, how you want people to view you, etc. While it's hard to linguistically articulate these ideals, especially as an ISFP, they need to be recognized. \n\nTl;dr, you have an idea what you want. Don't let being an ISFP stop you. 
3	Identity, what's that? For real, I've never seen the idea of having an identity as nothing but self-limiting. Sure, it gives a sense of security knowing you're that and that, but it comes with a price.
2	I get you. When I was a teen people would always say stuff like 'just be yourself' and I would always think 'but I don't know who I am'. You said that you loved the freedom editing gives you, so shouldn't that be enough? Isn't that something that makes you an individual?
7	Hello fellow iSFPs, what do you like to do on your days off?	22 male ISFP going to college and work part time. Personally After a work week I go hide in my room on Friday night, then try to have a guilt free Saturday off where I have no plans(usually involves guilt anyway) but will try to do one social activity with friends which sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't (I have two and one of them doesn't live near me). \n\n\nThen Sunday I try to have a laid back day but get super anxious about work and school starting up again. I tend to get super guilty and ashamed of myself if I don't do something even on my days off so I try to leave the house at least once per day to do something whether it be grocery shopping or getting gas. Not doing stuff also makes me stir crazy and makes my depression worse so I'm also fighting that on off days because I don't have my job or class to keep me distracted. \n\nI'm an ISFP with anxiety and depression from an abusive childhood so I'm probably not normal. Sorry I'm such a downer :(. Anyway what do you like to do on your days off. 
8	I like to do nothing as well. Some weekends I have some family/social obligations but honestly I find that if I stay at home but still do something new (try new a recipe/food, watch an informative youtube video/lecture, do some exercise/something creative) it feels more productive. The worst is sitting in bed all day just eating and being on the internet - it contributes to the depression and also doesn't REALLY help you recharge.
4	i get by one day, one week at a time. very similar the way you do, apparently. there's some comfort, there.
3	Sleep in, listen to music, play videogames, get high. I try to hang out with my friends and few times a week too.
2	I take it day by day, no 2 days off are really the same. I just try to do things that will relax me and help with my anxiety. Spending the day hiking or climbing is one of my favorite ways to spend a day or just hanging around playing my bass or writing something. The only real constant for my days off is "ok let's try to manage this anxiety while I have a chance".
1	I tend to get a bit depressed if I just idling......so I play computer games a lot. 
1	I will say that while my brain tells me to hide out at home and take lots of "me" time, I have way better weekends when I go out and do stuff.\n\nI have had a number of lonely weekends spent at home. My last romantic relationship ended months ago, and I too struggle from anxiety and depression. So last weekend I decided that even though my friends weren't interested, I would go check out this local festival in my neighboring town on my own. And you know what, I had an AMAZING time, much better than if I just say at home. I drank some beers, watched a couple bands, stopped into a bar for a flight of whiskey (maybe the booze helped my enjoyment lol). But man, it was refreshing.\n\nI recently bought a camera and will soon buy a tent. The idea being that I'll go camp somewhere and see the sights and take lots of pictures. Just get out of the house for a while. I'm excited to start doing it!\n\nIt is nice to have brief moments of time at home to unwind and relax, but doing it for a whole weekend is, I have learned, not good for my mental health.
1	On my first day off I generaly just relax and catch up on what i've missed on like youtube and reddit and what not. The next weekend day is when I pick something and work on it. Admittedly it's not usually anything like hard, just something like "Play that Video Game that RIcky won't stop recommending" or "Read that book that caught your attention".
9	ISFP Description By Victor Gulenko (Socionics ESI "Dreiser")	
2	I'm pretty sure that's ISFJ.
4	isfps how often do you use ni?	idk,but as an infp i find myself using si just as much as i use ni?,so how often do you guys use ni?,and could you sometimes be mistaken as an intuitive like an infp on tests because perhaps you use ni so much but infact you isfps?
2	It's possible, depends on circumstances and the environment. My ex (ISFP) started testing as INFP on many tests about a year into our relationship, and conversely, she probably also enhanced my Fi.
1	i always feel it "there" during my daily life and it helps me realize truths + patterns about the world around me that i cant really put into words. it helps w my understanding of the world and ppl, as well as how to react to certain situations
16	It looks like yall have never done face thread, I would love to see some isfp faces!	Hahaha. Damn. From the few isfps I know, the comments don't surprise. Worth a shot. 
12	The one thing I love about Reddit is you don't have to look at people faces 
9	Wrong subreddit for that lol
9	Well this ain't happening innit.
6	What is face thread?
7	[deleted]
5	eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh, face, what. no no. 
3	Hahaha! I absolutely love our collective reaction. Yeah, no thanks :)
5	:)
3	Hahah my own mother has enough trouble getting me in a picture
8	The ISFP Personality Type from an infj perspective	
6	What do you guys think about the movie "eyes Wide Shut"?	Here is the link to the movie just for you guys to remember it: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/\n\nI personally love it now. I remember when I saw it back in 1999. I back then thought it was "painfull to watch" cause it brought up some wierd feelings i could not explain. I was then married to a woman I did not truly love and that did not share my intense feelings for life etc. I dont think she reacted to the movie at all really. She commented something I remember and never spoke of the movie again. But it stuck with me. I have always "worshipped" Nicole kidman after that movie...(along with the hot prostitute that died)\n\nThen...a few years ago I mentioned the movie to my much younger GF. A woman I truly love and desire. She kinda liked it...i just showed her the "sex clips" and she liked it. She is very sexual and i guess that helps alot (my x-wife was not really sexual at all..just extremly smart).\n\nThen....fast foreward to last night, Me and my GF even "played out" a litte bit of the movie ourself and it was pure magic. A magic for the senses I think I have never expereinced before. That wierd music in the background...and she playing the totally lost, submissive prostitute was absolutely sentational. She smiles a little bit tio much in the start and I think she was about to laugh....but she quickly and by my "direction" turned into being lost...and basically looked like she was on drugs.\n\nI'm pretty much addicted to strong experiences (but never truly life threatening dangerous like parajumping etc) where I can use all of my senses 100% so this was a fantastic thing. She loved it aswell.\n\nSo I was thinking that the ISFP community might like Eyes wide shut "themes"...or I might be wrong but the whole thing is just perfect I think:)\n\nEDIT: Mind you! I do NOT share in the "darker meaning" of the film. I would never ever really want to experience the "theme" in real life and in person (I probably could have watched as a fly on the wall), but as a "thill for the senses" and for "in the mind only role play" its utterly perfect!\n
8	How Each Personality Type Responds to Art	
2	I don't really get art to  be quite honest. It's nice to look at but that's kind of it for me.
5	The one ISFP I know is the most difficult person to read	I happen to be an INTJ. I have an ISFP friend that I deeply care about and cherish. He's very kind, smart, funny, creative and so on. And he has that down for whatever attitude that I hear many ISFPs seem to have. I used to like this attitude. But recently, I've grown to fear that he is somehow compromising, because he doesn't ever say what he wants at all. He doesn't talk about his passions, he mostly doesn't talk about himself. If I asked him what he wanted to do he would just scratch his beard and smile while looking around. Heck, yesterday I tried to ask him what he wanted to do on the phone: 10 seconds of silence. I had to break it.\n\nNot only that, he seems to be wondering around, not in employment, not in training, not in education. Motherfucker used to forget his calculator during math exams and physics exams, and still score B+ and A. He got the BRAINS to do whatever he puts his mind to, but he's not putting it to anything. Of course, I don't open this topic with him, except for once when I asked him what his plan was, didn't get any viable response, asked him what he wants to do, even if just hypothetically, still no response. \n\nI think I'm going to just give up trying to understand the dude, and just be down for whatever myself. If you guys have any thoughts that can help me understand I'd really appreciate it. But thank you guys anyways, lurking here was in itself helpful. 
4	Hi there, ISFP checking in. My experience with INTJs have been less than swell, so it's really nice to see you tuning into your perceptions of this ISFP. Here are my experiences combined with my advice to you:\n1) He likely has no clue how much you care and cherish him. How do you express this to him? A lot of connection, trust, and openness can be created between these two types just by showing your appreciation for him.\n2) ISFPs are more compromising than INTJs. In fact, I perceive INTJs as completely unwilling to compromise. It's grown into resentment for the people in my life that are INTJ, because I in fact always feel like I am sacrificing. That doesn't mean I know the answer though..\n3) You have to work extra hard for a partnership with these two. ISFP want to independent and make their own choices, but often get stuck in what those choices really are. An example of getting past this is the 3,2,1 method. ex. picking a restaurant, one person provides 3 restaurant options/types of food, the other picks two from that, the last person makes the decision. This helps figure out what ISFP really likes and dislikes (for himself)\n4) Aimlessness.. sounds familiar to me. Not sure why this is of concern to you, you won't be able to change that about him. You can only support him and hope he opens up to you about his dreams in the future. We are not future-oriented or like planning. I am still struggling with this myself.\n\nHere are my tips for you:\n- Be more expressive, understand the ISFP won't judge you for it. Tap into your feelings, you should feel a pull to do this naturally in their company.\n- Be in the present. It's times when you spend with them that you should be curious about the world, the fives senses, your observations around you. It's comments like these that usually open to great, deeper conversation with ISFP.\n- Do you like this ISFP romantically? If so, they may be guarded because thinks aren't really outlined between you two.\n- Be consistent. The biggest thing that broke my trust with INTJ was hot and cold behaviour. He could say he was just going through things at the time, but I took it personally in the moment and there's no going back from that. 
4	ISFP’s tend to struggle with long term planning because we are present orientated. He’s very agreeable and tends to go along with what others want because going along with other people’s agenda’s is easier for him. He wants to maintain whatever peace of mind he has and words like work/discipline seem to disturb that. I think one way of motivating him might be exercise. This might not seem like ‘work’ in the traditional sense, but it’s one way of being active. It also forces him to be in touch with his body and to actually move about, which is something that ISFP’s need because they have sensing.  Picking up a sport will also help nurture self-discipline because exercise is something you have to stick with. It’d be good if you asked him come along with you and some friends, so then it won’t seem like work.\n\nIn terms of goals, maybe he genuinely doesn’t know? It might seem far-fetched but I think it’s hard for some people because everybody seems to have known since they were a child. Asking him what he wants to do will leave you with a blank stare or a 'I don't know' kind of response. I think he needs to explore his options. I’d suggest finding a list of different occupations (some which include physical work) and then going through them with him one day. Keep in mind that a lot of ISFP’s tend to be creative so something like web development might interest him. \n\nI think a lot of ISFP’s know what they need to do in order to be successful but just lack the motivation to carry through with it. Personally something that motivates me is when people suggest that I’m incapable of doing something because it’s too hard etc.  Also have you heard of the enneagram? I think that would be a useful read. Does this sound like your friend? https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9/\n\nI’d also say this method of being productive would be helpful for an ISFP: https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/. An app I’m aware of is ToDoList , so he gets constant reminders on what he needs to do throughout the day. https://en.todoist.com/.  Day to day planning is essential for ISFP’s, so a weekly timetable would be useful. Something else that will help him do work is taking a lot of breaks in between work. So 25 mins work, 5 min break and then another 25 mins etc will be helpful in getting him to do work. \n\nI don't know what sort of dynamic you have but I'd suggest you introduce these things subtly. Try not do all of this at once, but just bit by bit. 
2	I don't even know how to respond in this thread, I guess it's an ISFP thing? Often when I'm writing something (especially an answer to someone's thread or a comment) I find myself completely deleting the message and not posting anything while thinking "It doesn't matter" or "Eh whatever". Almost did it with this one :/
2	I can tell you one thing. As an ISFP I need 100% passion and I need it directed at myself from any potential partner. Then I will give it back 100%.\n\nThe description of this guy seems like he is the most passive and laid back person I have ever heard about. Almost as if he's on drugs tbh hehehe. \n\nAnd as far as I know, we ISFP's talk about our passions alot....WHEN we are in a safe zone and when we trust someone.\n\nI'm a little bit puzzled at this guy....and tbh..I am VERY puzzled about what you actually like about him?...To me he is the manifastation of boring and I think I would have had big problems being his pal hehe. (and secretly I think he is pot smoking junkie)\n\nEDIT: PS I'm not trying to offend anyone, I just try to write how I feel about it given the information that we have gotten:)
5	GUYS GIVE ME A LIST OF SE THINGS TO DO?	guys give me a list of se things to do?,but nothing outside the house,just indoor activities thanks!
3	Clean like a anal house wife. This is my life.
2	dance party
3	se and ne?	ok so for the past few days iv been consiously trying to tap into using se,eg by being aware of my envirmonment,noticing external onjects in a concrete way ect....and i noticed that i cant stay there for long without getting bored,infact iv discovered its because i constantly want the next fix of enjoyment i stay in ne letting ideas flow out so i cant become inspired by some,infact if i lost all form of enjoyment id probably fall into se,.......now my question is what energizes you guys when using se?and im not talking about mountain climbing,surfing or doing thigns like thatm,,.....i mean on a lazy sunday whe you just alone at home for eg,...what would stimulate you using se?
3	One thing above all. Computer gaming!! \n\nI remember my childhood....extreeeemly bored! One cannot constantly be out and about in heavy rain....many times one is confined to the house.\n\nThen at the age of 16 I got a computer. I was sold for life! Gaming makes that I seldom grow bored anymore.
8	worst vs best jobs for isfp?	Do you think ISFP would excel as a doctor/nurse? What about an ER doc? XD These jobs are helping others..but might so stressful it would be hell. But I think nothing would be worse than manager. What do you guys think?
2	 I have a list of jobs I would consider, every time I find something new I add it to the list \n\nNatGeo Photographer \n\nMotoGP Rider\n\nSailor\n\nCowboy \n\nAdventurer \n\nExplorer \n\nBartender \n\nCameraman \n\nLifestyle Photographer
3	This site had a great breakdown of ISFP and recommended professions. https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality
2	i'm in school for architecture and there are a couple isfps in my class who do great work\n\n*edit i am an entj
1	Currently a graphic designer and I like it. We need a job we can express ourselves in and something not too monotonous.
1	i want to be a professor and just sit around thinking all day, or a psychologist.  Doing stuff is for extroverts.
12	What type do you find drawn to you?	I always hear about ENFPs obsessing over INTJs or INFPs obsessing over ENTJs. Is there an ISFP equivalent? Is there a type that really likes us or are we kind of always in the background/left out? Who would you say is attracted to ISFP naturally?
13	INTJ here, and girlfriend is an ISFP. We're in heaven, we talk all the time, the affection both emotionally and physically is like a dream come true. She not only picks up on my emotions, she draws them out of me effortlessly. When we're out together around social situations we both turn into extroverts from the comfort of each other being close. \n\nBest part is we both get it when the other needs some "me" time, and needs to veg. There's no competition for time.
5	INTP spouse of an ISFP.  We are best friends and always seem to be happier than our other committed peers (stories of fighting, disagreements, etc).  Not that we don't fight, we just hate doing it because we'd rather be joking around together and just want to get the fight over with to go back to having fun.  We tend to balance each other out in the best ways without thinking the other person is crazy for thinking the opposite about something.  Really goes to show that so much of relationships come down to respect not just being on the same page.
5	I know an ISTP who loves ISFPs. I like ISTPs too but think they can come off as douchey sometimes if you don't know them very well. I've noticed ESFPs are really drawn to me, which sucks because I do not like them at all. I think ISFJs like us because we're both pretty chill. I don't know of any other type really "obsessing" over us though.
2	I also am dating an intj. I'm a guy isfp she's the intj and we are like peas and carrots. We can talk about anything constructively and with great fun. I dig the outlandish and far thinking that the intj is and she can also separate her emotions easier. That comes with a down side since I base my reality on what I'm feeling and she absolutely doesn't. Although we compliment each other very well. 
2	Yet another INTJ dropping in that has an ISFP girlfriend. Where as the ENFP-INTJ relationship seems to be some sort of anomaly and built mostly out of novelty, I feel like the ISFP-INTJ relationship has larger grounds in actual growth and stability in the long run, assuming both people are self-aware and willfully developing. The key here is maturity. We complement each other in a lot of ways to make a very strong pairing. I imagine for a lot of us, we're the pairing we don't realize we've always wanted until you try it. You just add some much needed sensitivity and prodding for adventure to our lives. 
2	I find that introverted feeling guys have crushes on me, but only if I act like my goofy, weird, somewhat domineering self around them. A lot of them are intuitive too surprisingly. I think they were infx, infp (2?), isfp (?). One enfp took an interest in me but I kind of brushed him off (he has crazy ex that is enfp or infj I think). I'm still not that interested in him romantically (he probably isn't either because it was long ago) but I really wish I got to know him better. He was really interesting! All the extroverted guys I like didn't even notice me until I gave out signs that I liked them, and I think they eventually liked me back (estp and enfp(?))
1	Guys who have liked/crushed on me (at least, ones whose types I know): INTP, xSTJ, ExTP, ExFJ. There are some extroverts at work that act like they're into me, but that could be because introverts are less likely to approach and initiate conversation. \n\nA lot of xNTJs online say they love us, but given how prevalent the intuitive bias is, I have no idea how true that is.\n\nENFPs seem to like us too.
1	I'm attracted to ISFPs. But a very certain kind of ISFP. Older males, uber-artistic, with high Ni and Te. Also, I married one of them XD
5	isfps and there inner world?	hey i woke up today with a thought since isfps have fi and ni inside there inner world must be magic,could you guys explain some of your inner visions about things?
10	I've always trying to understand myself. I often think about what kind of person I am, reflecting on who I once was, who I am now and who I'll be in the future. Some people define themselves purely through labels, but once you strip away those labels, nothing remains. Labels can be useful but somewhat limiting. I prefer to look at my life in stages, especially the major life events and periods that have impacted me. I ask myself, who am I now? Who will I be tomorrow? How have things changed? I've been many people throughout my life. It sounds cheesy but I'm not the same person I was a year ago.\n\nSe users are observant, action orientated and also tend to have high self efficacy. Some non Se users view us as mindless and hedonistic. Can you hate a person for liking the good things in life?!? In truth Se-Ni can make ISFP's an unstoppable force. There are many times where I've doubted my ability to achieve my goals or cope with something and yet something compels me to keep going. I know there is something beyond what I am experiencing and that the future holds something better for me. I tell myself "Don't be so pathetic, pull your socks up and keep going". \n
8	I'm in an unhealthy Fi-Ni loop. Let me tell you-- it feels like being under the ocean. Even though we have secondary Se, we suppress it unconsciously sometimes. I've always had problems with daydreaming since I was little, before the Fi-Ni loop. Usually my daydreams are about fighting injustices with superpowers or creating stories and characters within these stories (think the Secret Life of Walter Mitty movie). Sometimes I do this when I work and I can't stop it! Other times, I just feel tired and dazed, always sleepy (but I can't go to sleep), and there's just not much in my mind, but my mind isn't really interacting with the world. I'm not here. Sometimes I confuse my dreams with reality. I'll be awake and I'll remember a nightmare that seemed real, and actually panic because I thought it actually happened. It's funny because I have very realistic dreams (Se?). What can you expect from a loop with two introverted functions-- they're not good with keeping in touch with the world.\n\nThe Fi-Ni comes out with my existentialist crisis. We want to live a moral life that is reflective of the truth. But what is the truth? What if there is no truth? It also feeds my interest in esoteric things like tarot cards and astrology (my Fi-Ni loves symbolism) and literature with a lot of esoteric symbolism and Ni-like instances. In Heart of Darkness, he describes crew members on a boat suddenly going to sleep. Most people wouldn't think he was describing their deaths. I wrote an essay on this book relating to morals (Fi) too, supported by a lot of Ni symbolism. I like to connect two seemingly unrelated things, like magic and sex. My Fi-Ni likes to read some Aleister Crowley sometimes.  
4	I feel I can be many different persons. They are not totally different ofc, but at times I am withdrawn and totally immersed with my happy thoughts. Almost smiling for myself. Looking forward to get away from what I am currently doing, dreaming of coming home to my family. To my computer games. To the company of just myself and ppl I really love. And basically to a place where nobody demand anything at all from me. \n\nOther times I am extremely extroverted, and a few ppl have thought I had ADHD. Almost all of those occasions have been under the influence of alcohol. \n\nToday I saw some mountains and some late snow on them. Quite a scenery. It brought tears to my eyes and I felt so much in love with life. And it's not that I want to go to those mountains. The magic is all in my head, and actually going to them can possible break the immersion and spell. 
4	Unicorn, unicorn, potato-man with a lightsaber. \n\nLike 80% of the stuff in my head is either series, anime or movies. I have stopped trying to understand what goes on in my head, because most of it is not that important and I feel it is just for my entertainment. My thoughts tend to jump around. I started to focus more on how the thought makes me feel and then I interpret the feeling with meaning rather than trying to interpret the thought. Seems to work for me. \n\n
13	Anyone else annoyed that other people dont understand our purchasing habits?	When I receive something as a gift or I buy it myself, I treat it like it was a family member. Everything I own I have had for years. And everything I purchase these days is either hobby related or a necessity like food and gas (I'm young yes haha). My family gets mad at me for buying expensive things like Computer parts or audio gear but I take care of my shit. Although I may have expensive taste at least I'm not buying a new iPhone every year because I dropped it ten times (never cracked my phone ever). Or buying new clothes all the time because I don't care for them. And better yet I don't spend my paycheck on drugs or alcohol, so get off my case. Sorry for the rant but people don't really seem to get it that we like to take care of our shit ( assuming I am not alone).
9	Not me! I'm shit at looking after my things. If I crack my phone screen and it becomes un-usable I really don't think twice about the money I spend to get it fixed. Only a minor annoyance. And I still wouldn't bother getting a case for it. Lots of my money goes on food alcohol and drugs and clothes haha.
4	I'm actually very frugal. I have a spending budget.\n50% on necessities, 30% on expenses and 20% savings. I'm a student so I kinda have to be strict with money. Before college I used to spend money like it was nothing. 
4	ISFP Interest in puzzle type games?	I've always gravitated toward short, turn-based puzzle games like Chess, Crosswords, Sudoku, and Scrabble.  I also really like simple Tetris based games like Tetris Attack, Dr. Mario and variants.  Although I enjoy them, I'm terrible at fast-paced reaction type games like first person shooters, racing, etc.  I can never finish an RPG because it takes too long and I lose interest. \n\nWhat kinds of games do you enjoy?
4	I really like logical games with patterns and stuff like that.\nI even take those worthless online IQ test and treat them like browser games.
3	Yes, I am! I love tetris, too. My favorite games are strategy-oriented. \n\n\nBut to counter that, I am also excellent at First-Person Shooters, and I love RPG, such as Final Fantasy 7. Maybe I just like games...
3	I hate puzzles, but I love adventure games, mmo and shooters. I like to be amazed by all the beauty of this world (from the safety of my home using a computer...or in the past dating as many girls from my town that i possibly could), but I dont like to get stuck on any puzzle at all! I only like things I know I can master or things I have no reason or urge to master:) \n\nI think thats why I dont like puzzles. They will stop me going foreward unthil I have solved them! Fuck that! I'm going foreward regardless anyway!
2	You might love the cave. It's awesome, it's a working cave with different characters so you can play thru 3-5 times with different storylines. And it's funny and a puzzle.
1	Yes, I'm an active chess player. I go to a chess club and have participated in a few tournaments. One thing I've noticed is that I'm really bad at time management compared to other players. I almost never see other players running out of time, but in my case it's the cause of like 80% of my losses in blitz games. I always get pleasantly surprised when I notice my opponent has less time on the clock than me lol
1	I play almost exclusively multiplayer FPS. They're good distractions, let my mind wonder while giving my hands something to do, and I appreciate historical and realism factors a lot as well.
16	Do you feel like people don't take your seriously?	IDK if it's because we're seen as passive, but even in personal matters, I feel like I'm not taken seriously. And then the moment I'm more dominating people are like "wow! calm down!"
14	YES I only ever show my true self to my family. I space out a lot because I don't really care about impressing other people (even though I dislike being judged). That may have something to do with being "passive". I wish people would LISTEN when we do have something to say. But then again, I don't really listen to other people...
8	Hell yeah, that is me. I usually just want things to go smoothly, so I go along with whatever agressive people say, but recently it has been really getting on my nerves, but when I say a super normal "no, I can't do that, sorry", it's like I insulted someone's dead mom. Because it used to be "oh don't worry about todayismanday, they are definitely cool with this", no! Ugh.\n\nJust keep practicing being assertive though, it is worth it.
6	Even after I prove myself to people, they still don't take me very seriously.
2	Not really. A guy once told me I don't talk much but when I first talk it's really worth listening to. I've noticed this personally too, when I speak up the room usually goes quiet (which can be somewhat anxiety provoking lol).
6	What do you guys think of intjs	I interact with isfps pretty regularly (work in design) and other than work it feels hard for me to connect with them. So I'm trying to understand how I'm viewed and work out some insecurities I have socializing with them
3	I'm ISFP and my boyfriend is INTJ. We are very different, but we work wonderfully together. He always says he has a hard time understanding what I'm thinking at times, and then I would get sad, because he didn't understand what I communicate with him (without words). But we can talk about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING, and that is why we work. Communication is the backbone of any relationship.
3	I find it hard to connect, despite wanting to. They've all ended up in disaster for me. I feel like I do nothing but compromise for them and they do nothing but take (they obviously don't see it that way, but I think the problem is the way they give doesn't resonate with ISFPs, so we don't recognize it).\n\nedit: I'd like to add that I think we are both cautious around each other because our strengths are their weaknesses and vice versa. So it's hard to figure out the compatibility. If you want to feel closer to them, try being more open with your feelings and taking in the present moment vs. the future.
2	I dont really connect with most of them at my work. I am strangly enough a scientist and also a ISFP. needless to say...I kinda choose the wrong education and line of work. I think the INTJ's think I am lazy.....and I am...but nobody should even consider thinking it or showing it to me..I take great offence if I find out they have any negative attitude with me being lazy. I'm cool with ppl telling me I'm lazy but they think its cool:) Then I love them:)
2	Savage. Every INTJ I've come across has been incredibly blunt. I can tell they really dgaf lol. But I respect their drive and work ethic. They tend to be intelligent. I've never had the opportunity to get close to one though. 
7	Does Being an ISFP Limit you from reaching your goals? If so, listen to this now.	
1	why do you relate this to isfp?
15	Drunk/High [weed] personality?	I'm an internet psychoanalyst and frequent observer of my own behaviors. \n\nAny time I get high (like right now [ weed ] ), I get extremely vigilant of the submotivations and behavioral nuances driving people's actions. I compare myself to them, and really want to understand why we all behave so differently. \n\nHowever, when I'm drunk, I'm very social, less sensitive to the subcommunications of others and confidently get what I want in a creative and borderline manipulative way. I act congruently and emotionally unstifled and say basically anything that comes to mind. \n\nIs this just me, or is this common among ISFPs?
6	When I get high, I overanalyze as well, but it manifests as a crippling aversion to talking or communication. I will instead sit in a corner and observe the social hierarchies. But on more than one occasion, I have nearly made comments stemming from these observations that may have been wrong or percieved in the wrong way. That's vague. But I guess I mean saying something would have placed judgement on my friends' or families' motivations in relation to their statements or behavior. Maybe that's why I remain silent. I have stopped smoking weed because this situation became such a common occurrence. I probably would again if I could be completely isolated and experience the high in the comfort of my room. I feel like it amplifies my already insular nature. If I drink tho, I just bro out lol.
1	No. No idea what the fuck you're talking about.
1	I don't enjoy getting drunk, so I can't say much about that. Getting high, it is hard to have complex thoughts, haha! If I'm in an unfamiliar scenario, I get worried I'll say something way off, and prefer to just focus on watching tv or whatever. I'll get lost in my own thoughts, which isn't so cool. But if I'm with people I like and I can be myself, and they are also drunk/high/not judging me, I tend to laugh a lot, feel affectionate towards those people, want to do something fun like play videogames or whatever.\n\nEither way, I'm never manipulative or anything like that. And I'm probably more confident when I'm sober. Even getting a meal ready when I'm stoned seems like climbing up a mountain
3	ISFP detailed description by Stratiyevskaya, including shadow functions (Socionics ESI "Dreiser")	
9	[academic] Perceptions of self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a good sample.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nCheers https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN
3	Could you share the results with us?
1	I just submitted; hope it's not too late. And yes, do share the results.
12	Read this - tRIGGER WARNING, hard analysis of ISFP	
8	There are two things I don't agree with... astrology/horoscopes, which is what this whole article source comes from, and the fact that the author states "ISFPS tend not to be very introspective". I'm intro as fuck, to a fault, maybe just me though 
3	[deleted]
3	"The ISFP doesn’t really care if they are understood or misunderstood. They don’t really care that much about who they are or their true place in the world. Not ambitious that way."  \n  \nDefinitely not true for me. I'm the opposite of this. Other than that this was pretty accurate and raw. 
1	Wow. Creepily accurate for the most part.
4	ISFPs, what's a real-life situation you've experienced where you clashed with an FJ?	I'm really interested in hearing about actual, real-life experiences Fi dominants have had where you have clashed with FJs, and particularly EFJs (Fe dominants). What was the situation, how do you think your opposite orientations of Feeling played out, and how did you feel about the whole thing? The more detail about what was said and done, the better! :)
5	When they pack 4 weeks for a 2 week vacation.
3	 Didn't know this clash existed-- it always seems the ISFPs I know get along with FJs
3	[deleted]
7	Is it common to not have a boiling point for ISFP's?	I am an ISFP, and was wondering if my dilemma was common for my type or not. I've literally never hit a rage, mode towards another person. I get mad, and when I am upset I usually lock myself away in my room, but I've never so much as yelled at someone else.\n\nWhich is I'm kind of asking because I live with an ESTJ, who gets under my skin, and I'm honestly scared that one of these days I'm going to go off on him, physically. I wouldn't last two seconds in a shouting match, he's got a very, forceful personality, so in a shouting match I wouldn't stand a chance, which means my only recourse it feels like is violence. \n\nIt's not something I want. I don't ever want it to come to that, but he really, pushes me, and the fact that I haven't taken a swing at him despite dealing with his attitude for the past 5 years, makes me wonder if it's cowardice on my part not to.\n\nIs this an ISFP in general thing?\n\n(By the way I do know ESTJ's I'm friends with. This specific one is the issue.)
9	I'm an isfp and have also noticed that I've never been genuinely enraged. It would make sense in my mind-being that we tend to seclude ourselves from uncomfortable situations (at least, I do) 
5	[deleted]
5	I get enraged rarely. \nIt barely gets to this point anymore but I would get to a point that at the end of a 15 minute period something will be damaged; knuckles, walls, childhood toys, drawers, chairs etc. I actually have four small scars on my knuckles from punching a wall on separate occasions. \n\n\nCurrently my extreme anger manifests itself as a gnashing of teeth and a faux pulling of hair, heavy breathing and an immediate halt of any current activities. \n\nSometimes at people, most of the time when I'm in my room thinking about those people. 
4	With' closest family member, yes I can yell.\n\nWith friend's and other's I only get cold silent angry-behavor even when I get really angry, and usally try to talk about it easy or move on. So the bad tension don't grow.
3	I get mad very rarely, at most getting visibly annoyed. Times when I really should be mad I usually end up locking myself in my room and crying. I've often thought that I feel sadness when other people would feel anger.
1	I used to snap and go into rage mode a LOT when I was younger. I was very volatile.\n\nNot so much anymore. I wonder if perhaps it had to do with undeveloped functions when I was younger?
5	Share your best memories with current or past SO's	For me it was having our first nap together in peace and quiet. \n\nShare your moments! 
3	I only have one SO who was isfj. We didn't really complement each other. I remember tactile experiences the most (touch is the language of love!) I loved when he kissed my forehead or touched my back. Mostly I was unfair to him though, because I was always jealous. But I'm pretty sure he liked his female best friend (there were signs). \n\nI remember this boy I liked in middle school. I liked him so much that my chest literally hurt whenever I saw or thought about him. I thought about him so much one night I cried because of the pain. He liked me back too and I'm sure that was the closest I ever got to falling in love. Not sure of his type though.\n\n
7	Going into management or analyst job	I've been really interested in going into project management or an analyst role once I eventually finish college but I was just wondering if ISFPs like to go this route? Some things that are enticing about these careers are the computer-related work (I love computers), the benefits, and of course the great pay. But are there certain qualities we possess that prevent us from doing well in these roles? I know we tend to gravitate to much more creative and hands-on type of work but  at the same time I know a bit of it has to do with our own mindset and motivation but I'd like to know what you all have to say about this. Please feel free to chime in on anything you may have to say about your jobs/careers anyways too. Thanks for reading!\n\nedit- a sentence
6	I'm currently working as an analyst in information security. If that's what you want to do, go for it! I've been rather happy with it so far. :)
5	you shouldnt worry about if xxxx would want to go this route, just ask yourself if you would enjoy it.\n\ndont let those 4 letters define who you are and who you aren't, there's always room to grow as a human being :)  you might not be the analytical type right now, but whos to say in a years time you cant develop that quality?\n\ni think the question you should be asking yourself is if your love of computers would outweigh the cons of the job 
3	Apparently it's not ISFPs idea of a dream job. I've always wondered if I'd like to be an analyst but I wonder if the idea of it is more appealing than the actual work.
5	How is your relationship with your parents?	
6	I go to college nearby so I am with them all the time. I like to think it's good but I come off as really irresponsible and not independent so they always feel they need to handhold me through everything which gets extremely irritating. I yell at them a bit which I regret a few hours later. They don't deserve it most of the times 🙃\n\nedit- some words
3	The relationship with my mom has been turbulent one could say, although it has gotten better after I moved out. My dad idk. We never fight, but the thing with him is that he has always been really reserved. He's there and he gives me money, but not much more really.
3	[deleted]
1	I have a much closer bond to my mother than my father. My father offers me support whenever I need it, but is still kind of distant. Whereas my mother cares too much to the point where it's overbearing. We didn't really separate on good terms. 
1	I live with my dad and travel to see my mom from time to time. She lives 5 hours away so sometimes it's difficult. My mom is smart and loving while my dad simply respects my privacy. Inherently this makes me think he's stupid and not a father sometimes but I still love him. He hates that I am smarter than him and frequently tells me to shut up when I point out things he's done wrong. My dad left my mom because he turned gay and I live with him, his partner (awesome guy really) and my sister. Life is okay and good at the same time.
1	great with my mom who is extroverted, and kind but very distant with my dad. 
1	My mom is a full blown alcoholic with all the wonderful elements of selfishness, grandiosity, narcissism, and manipulator to the highest degree. She did not raise me she only stepped in our family to create tension and drama. She lives to humiliate others by telling all secrets or rumors she hears and plasters what she thinks she knows all over social media. Most days I don't even bother to try but have to tip toe my around her because of my siblings. I have no clue what they see redeeming in her since she always pulls the same crap. Luckily my parents are not together and have not been in years.\nMy father and I have a really weird relationship. We basically talk about the weather and light hearted topics careful to avoid conflict because boy oh boy when there is conflict it goes down. I respect him and take care of his home when I visit, I'll clean everything and cook for him. My husband will mow, and take care of mechanical issues with his vehicle. 
12	How do you, as an ISFP, feel about weddings?	Like the planning that's involved... The attention...\n\nI've never wanted a huge wedding for myself because I hate attention, I hate planning, and can't be bothered with all the romantic stuff..... if ever get married I want to elope. Lol I was wondering if other ISFPs thought about weddings.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAnd if you're married, what was your ISFP wedding like?
10	I agree, I really have no interest in having a wedding, just like I have no interest in attending my college graduation ceremony. I don't really see the point. Just seems like a big hassle. 
5	I see it as the opertunity to show your decision to commit to the people you feel are important. And then due to my religious veiws. Planning is not fun. Ill help make decisions but not plan. I also dont care how fancy it is, its not about how fancy it is. It is about the other person. \n\nI think this will depend on our view on marriage and weddings. 
4	When I was planning my wedding I could not care less about anything except for my dress and the food. I recall hiding most of the night because I was exhausted and didn't want to talk to anyone. I'm divorced now lol but I have no desire to remarry as I don't really see the point in marrying someone. I think I can love someone forever without doing that and throwing away thousands of dollars.
3	The thought of walking down the aisle in a fancy dress with all eyes on me sounds like a nightmare! 
3	I feel terrible at over prices weddings. Specially bride dresses. I'd rather have a nice small party and invite close friends, and then use the money for furniture or helping people who need it. In fact, I don't know if I'll ever get married, let alone have a party. Either way, seems wasteful to me. People focus too much on the wedding party and forget about working on the actual marriage.
3	After reading the comments, I feel like I'm different from the other ISFPs that commented....\n\nI personally love weddings. I love seeing love, and I love surprising and doing things that make my SO happy. He always says that I never fail to surprise him. The actually wedding part is not too important to me, but I want it to be spontaneous and fun; a reason to celebrate, a reason to get people together. I don't like being the center attention, and I am terrible at planning :| That would make me feel so stressful. I'm MORE excited about the honeymoon part. I think it would make my SO very happy. I would only have 4 members of my family, and he'd have probably ~50 people from his family. 
2	I'm not married anymore but the wedding we had was simple, cheap, and a lot of fun. I tend to not like formalities, and neither did my ex, so the ceremony was super short. It was so short that one of the guests missed it entirely because she had to use the washroom XD \n\nIt was essentially just one big party. That's how weddings should be imo.
2	I hate weddings. I'd elope 100%. I can't be the centre of attention. I freeze up. I don't like going to weddings, I don't like planning them, the pictures bore me. I was in one wedding party....I'll never do it again. Zero desire. 
2	Weddings are meh. I'd prefer a smaller wedding, nothing too extravagant. I don't want people who couldn't give two shits about me attending it (like relatives of friends of friends). I'd treat it same way I'd treat a high school prom: having high and low exceptions at the same time, knowing it's a rite of passage thing but not making a huge deal out of it. The planning sounds terribly stressful. I'm a shy person though I like having my attention whore moments. As long as it's nothing too big. 
2	I looked at my boyfriend one morning and asked him if he wanted to go to the courthouse on Friday. It was great.
1	I don't know if I believe in marriage. I see more cons than pros so I'm not sure I'd ever be excited to have a wedding. 
1	i dont believe in marriage so... i guess im pretty indifferent toward them?
1	I'm only in high school so my opinion is probably gonna change, but right now I think of it as a hassle. Most of them are so pricey and take a lot of planning and UGH the attention. If I do end up getting married, I would love it to be a casual, private wedding in a place that is meaningful and romantic. Bonus points if we say the words of a Westerosi wedding instead of a casual one.
1	I have mixed feelings honestly. On one hand it's so much work and money for one day. But on the other hand, I do want that experience.\n\nBut as a whole, I lean towards wanting to save the money for a down payment on a house, or a nice honeymoon. I want a marriage more than a wedding.  I'm too much of an introvert to have people fawning over me all day. I'd want to just go home and relax by the time the reception starts.\n\nIf I have a wedding I'll probably keep it small and cheap.
1	I have no prospect of marriage anytime soon but I do bartend for a catering company which does a lot of weddings. It's literally the same thing over and over, ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, speeches, dancing. It seems so pointless and I for one would not like being the center of attention at it. This doesn't mean I don't value marriage, quite the contrary actually. It's just that weddings seem so unnecessary to me. 
1	We had a small wedding, 30 people in my aunt an uncles backyard, I didn't wear shoes, to feel the earth ;) \nThe planning was stressful, hello introverts, but it went fine. There was no striving for perfection, what ever will be, will be.  It was a great day.  Only regret, I forgot to organize the music beforehand so it got messed up, but it was such a mild thing. 
11	DAE blush VERY easily?	
7	I blush INSANELY easy. It's awful! 
5	NOPE
3	Yep. It's like a cruel joke from mother nature.
1	Yes, I do too...
1	Yep. Hate it. Sometimes I don't even feel embarassed, but when talking about a naughty subject close to people who I'm not too familiar with will often get this result. I honestly don't know why our bodies betray us this wayyy
1	I don't think I've ever blushed in my life.
4	ISFPs: what is your subtype? Fi or Se?	
1	[deleted]
1	I'm Se, my gf is Fi.
9	So whats your Creative outlet?	I listen to music and try to make my own. I take pictures and come up with song titles. I love riding my bike, being outside and drawing. \n\nWhat do you guys do when you're relaxed?
11	Listen to music, take a walk to the near forest when it's raining heavily, being in sauna, watching anime and reading stuff here.
5	Photography 
3	My mood 
1	Not really when I'm relaxed, but over the past couple years I've been making rap albums as basically an emotional outlet. I like rapping because I can make a while product myself without knowing how to play any instruments, hahaha.
1	Solo dance parties gets pent out energy. Painting/creating/writing something with my hands for when I want to express something to others.
1	Photography
1	I'm thinking of learning UI Design and making a side career out of it. doesnt seem so hard to learn and doesnt require much effort to apply for an ISFP
6	When do you know that a potential partner is a keeper? If you had to narrow it down to 3-5 qualities what would those be?	
9	narrowing it down to qualities isn't love
5	As long as you can both grow in a healthy way and support each other through personal growth than I say they are a keeper. 
3	Thoughtfulness \nWilling to go along with my spur-of-the-moment things\nTrustworthy 
2	When I feel they truly understand me and I understand them. When they show me ways they care that I can recognize as care/love. When I trust them fully. When I feel like I'm on an adventure whenever I spend time with them (even if we're just at home watching tv..if I prefer that to being alone, they're a keeper).
1	- Healthy dialogue about everything (no secrets, no blaming, just wanting to solve whatever is bothering someone)\n\n- Trust (no need to check phones, where the other person is, etc. If they want to cheat, they will. You need to trust them, otherwise it won't be healthy)\n\n- Freedom (related to trust, no forbidding the person from doing anything. If they want to talk to their ex or whatever, forbidding it won't solve it. If you are really upset about something, tell them, and they should understand and keep from upsetting you in the future)\n\n- Being reasonable (no 'crazy' demands or being upset over nothing. If I fell asleep and didn't message you, no need to get mad. Creating unreasonable expectations is a sure fire way to mess up any relationship, even a friendship)\n\n- Urge to better themselves (in any way they consider important, but specially self-knowledge. Therapy taught me how to deal with my issues so I don't dump them on other people. Similarly, I don't want anyone to dump their problems on me for no reason. Mutual support is great, of course, but often people just get nasty and don't even know *why* they are doing those things)\n\nEither way, I'm not really looking for a relationship right now. I dated for 5 years, but right now I feel like I'd do better in an open or polyamourous relationship, and not many people are willing to try that out. It really requires a lot more trust and dialogue, and dealing with jealousy (which I hate and honestly can't understand).\n\nAnd there is no sure way to know they are a keeper, but many ways to know that there are red flags. Don't let being in love blind you, making a relationship healthy is hard work. Good luck!
18	Anyone else get really territorial over music?	Like when you find some really good music or new artist you just keep it to yourself like a special secret or something.
13	No I'm happy to share my tastes with anyone who is interested. But it turns out that doom metal isn't all that popular among my friends so I end up enjoying it alone anyway. 
10	I can't stand to listen to other people's music if I don't like it. I'm actually a massive music hog, I want to be the DJ 100% of the time 
4	Not really what you're saying but i feel shame if i have to show people my music interests because of what they can think about them and me.
3	nah... i wouldnt want to deny others the joy of discovering a cool new song\ni'll be really really selective about who i share it with tho, just so happens sometimes that means no one :P
1	I produce music and want to share it with the world and get hyper vigilant every time I share it with others to see if they like it hehehe. I also clam up every time I hear shitty, cliche, simple minded, myopic radio music, only to remind myself how subjective music is :D\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bultman
8	Any ISFP's in a relationship with another ISFP?	Im wondering because I came across a book called how to stop elderly abuse by Anne Hart. It talks about different personality types and how they fit or clash with one another. I didnt expect that from this book.\n\nIt goes on to say an ISFP woman is good with another ISFP.\n\nIm an ISFP man, who had a crush before on an ISFP woman. I was afraid though, unsure of myself because I felt bad about a previous relationship with an ISFJ and i was afraid of hurting another person if i get into a relationship.\n\nI told her my feelings for her, and she was giddy that someone liked her, and then i was afraid of myself and i told her im not a good guy to be with.\n\nThen she gives me a very blunt msg telling me that i should be more positive, and that got me worried because, as an ISFP, I understand her view to want to be more positive.\nSometimes as ISFP we can be sad, and i was worried.\n\nI want also to have someone positive so i understood her bluntness and i felt afraid that im not good so i blocked her.\n\nIts been months but\nI want to make amends.\n\nI dont know how she would take it if i tried talking to her again.\n\nWhen the times i talked to her, we had this understanding of each other, like we knew how the other was feeling. It was like as if we could read each others' minds.\n\nIts was an amazing experience, but i dont know if she would want to talk to me still after what i did.\n\nAny help?
3	Unblock her and talk to her. If you guys have chemistry, go for it and see how it plays out! Hope it goes well
2	According to socionics studies long lasting identical type relations are uncommon. Identical type relationships are great for friendship, but you have exactly same strong points and weak points, so while you can understand and sympathize with them, you can't really help each other that much in life, neither can they tell you something radically new, insightful, and ground-breaking. Dating same type is exhilarating at first, from there is rapidly deflates.   \n    \nThis picture http://i.imgur.com/vBU1KwF.png shows the distribution of intertype relations among married couples. The top three relationship for ISFP from this picture are Duality (ENTJ), Activity (INTJ), and Semi-Duality (ESTJ), while "identity" which is a relationship between identical types is at the very bottom as least common long-term relationship type.
6	ENTP... Trying to figure out the maze of an ISFP- is she interested in me?	Okay, so here go my lengthy night posts (apologies in advance, if it drags on a little, I shall try and keep is succinct).\nENTP female here. \n\nAbout a week ago, I met this girl busking (also another musician/ busker), who I am assuming to make things simpler is an ISFP.\n\nShe's very artsy, literally lives and breathes art, music, photography, film, etc. Anyway I struck up a conversation with her as I was curious as to where I was able to busk in that particular area. Initially I had no other intentions except to learn more about the ins and outs of busking in that area from a fellow busker, who seemed very friendly and approachable. \n\nAnyway I introduced myself, said I was a busker, she shook my hand and introduced herself, was very smiley and friendly (just her peaceful nature I suppose). I made sure it was okay if I busked further down, and she said it was and was grateful I asked. I went off and busked a bit further down. \n As she passed me when she had packed up, she smiled, and mouthed that I was very good, and dropped in a dollar. Also as she turned the corner on the street, I saw her look at me for a bit longer and smile-- perhaps just her sort of wowed by me singing (not to be arrogant, but don't want to assume this is a sign of attraction). \n\nThat night, I found her on Facebook, as I wanted to check out her music (she was busking on a hand pan, but is also a singer/ multi instrumentalist) I was also intrigued by her, hard to explain. I messaged her, saying it was nice to meet her. \nWe struck up a conversation for a while, she said she thought I sounded so good, and she loved my voice.\nWe chatted about music for a while, the conversation flowed pretty well, and she kept asking me questions about me and my music. When she found out I was queer (well not straight) she seemed chuffed with herself cause apparently she'd picked up almost instantly that I was into girls haha. I asked why, and she said perhaps from my style (which she also said she loved) but also a vibe. \n We continued to chat, she kept complimenting me and being what I would say friendly, perhaps borderline flirtatious, although i am god awful at picking up on those things, hence why I'm enquiring on this forum. We talked about our sexuality (we both feel we're more attracted to the person than gender), she asked me what my type was aha. We chatted about relationships, etc. \n\nI was in a relationship (undefined) at the time, however the girl was slowly detracting her affection and I knew it, was just coming to terms with the fact it was gonna end (I have now broken it off). \nWe talked for a good few hours, she continued to keep the convo going, asking me questions about myself. Also her answers seemed quite thoughtful (typical of ISFP). We just seemed to click, like it seemed effortless chatting with her. We had some good laughs at stupid things (she has a rad sense of humour it turns out, very witty and sarcastic). \n.... \nWe chatted the next night, into the morning, and we were in fits of laughter. I somehow had the idea of making a carrot into a clarinet/ flute, and she strongly encouraged this insane plan of mine, and she kept joking with me. She pushed me (teasingly) into sending her a video of me playing on this carrot instrument, and apparently it "made her night"\n\nWe talked intermittently after that, we were both super busy with social events and music related activities. She continued to be quite fun and jokey (can't think of a better word) with me. I was  actually shocked at her blatant wit and her overt sarcasm. She also said to make sure I came and said hi if I was busking in the same spot as her any time. But again could just be her being friendly.\n\nWe stopped contacting each other as often over the past few days, because I was going through a tough time after ending things with this other girl, and she was super busy with gigs, and recording.  But we have had small chats here and there.\n\nDo you think there is a possibility she could be interested? Or do you see this as purely her being friendly? She seems to respect me at least, and find me inspiring and interesting as an artist which is nice. But how do you differentiate the friendly from the more-than-friendly with ISFP's? You guys are a very mysterious and secretive bunch, it seems.\nI wouldn't say I have a crush on her, but I am definitely fascinated by her- she's just so mystical, and there is something very intriguing and beautiful about her. She has this quiet confidence, like she knows who she is but doesn't feel the need to shout it, and is just comfortable with who she is. \n\nI know it was super long, thanks for your time!!! \n\n

3	Busking! I learned a new word today, thank you. :) You said it so many times that I just had to look it up lol Anyway, it sounds like she likes you, but you're probably gonna have to take lead if you want things to move forward, relationship wise. Things might have gotten a bit stagnate for her in your friendship, and thus the subtle, yet noticeable dwindling of contact. I would also say that the fact that she opened up about her sexuality with you at all, is probably a good indication that she's interested. Ask her to coffee, or a nice park or something and really try to get to know her :) Worst case scenario, you guys stop talking - which is kinda where you're heading right now anyway, or you might just end up with a really cool friend! Good luck, and please keep me updated! :)

1	Why can't people be friends first?
6	ISFPs, when it comes to intimacy, are you assuming a more domineering role or the submissive one? Or are you keeping it a balance?	
6	Depends on the context and the situation. I am reactive to what I feel I need to be at the time.
1	Can be dominating when very aroused. Submissive when you want to be dominated. Neutral when your mind is occupied or you're sleepy. It depends on how comfortable you are with the person you're with, and their preferred role as well. 
6	Anyone else hide their strong emotions in giant jars?	My biggest problem as a person is that I tend to keep most of my emotions locked away. It's gotten a lot better as I have matured and today I am a very outgoing and polite person but I still keep my strong feelings locked away. I tend to lockup especially when I am tired/frustrated and needing a break from dealing with other people (typically a introvert thing I believe). I had experienced large amounts of sadness and depression in my past due to parental problems. I went to therapy years ago but I never got over my feelings untill my life (through time) got over them for me. I've though about seeing another therapist but my rationale​ tells me that I myself would be the only person able to understand. Whenever bad things happen to me or people say things to me that make me hot headed, I feel like my mind punishes me by recalling bad memories and forcing their emotions back on my body. I'll try to cope with the nuances of the day and sometimes I can mellow out but sometimes I can't hold in my emotions enough and I erupt. I start not thinking before I speak and I generally don't like my demeanor. Am I fucked up? Do I need help? I don't know. All I know is that I love my mind but sometimes I wish it would shut up and let me live.
2	I used to. I used to have emotional outbursts. Usually anger, and it usually ended up exploding on someone who really didn't deserve the full wrath I unleashed. Sometime between high school and college I learned to let things out gradually and not bottle things up. The extreme outbursts caused so many problems and holding things in just made everything worse.
1	I also tend to live in my head and so things build up. I feel that it does help seeing someone, but not talk about your problems. You could try seeing someone to help you develope management stratagies, not to cope but to have a contructive way of letting your frustrations out before they get out of hand. Everyone is diffrent and there are many methods. And if you dont want to see someone, the net is full of info. \n\nThen also I find it helps having a healthy lifestyle. Its is my best way to let off frustration. 
1	What? Hide my emotions? I'm not hiding, you are! I'm perfectly fine!! /s\n\nWell, in my experience, I also bottled it all up, so deep that now I can't even tell what I really feel anymore. That seemed like a good idea, but now I see it wasn't. I want to be free, I want to be able to feel, even if it is sadness, it is only healthy to feel this way in some situations.\n\nNot even I can understand myself, so obviously no one else can do it better, not even a therapist. But! Going to therapy was the best decision I ever made in my life. It is not someone who will tell you 'oh this is wrong you need to do that' (at least mine is not), but a tool to help you navigate through life, have insights and understand yourself and others way better... really no downsides to it. 
5	Daily planning	What methods do you use when it comes to daily planning? I tend to struggle with daily planning. As of now, I have a planning board, in which I set myself weekly/monthly targets. I tend to achieve these targets. For instance giving up soda etc but actually getting shit done on a day to day basis is hard. 
4	i never plan anything. i just do the things im supposed to do when i remember to do them. pretty efficient
2	i use the app habitica to keep track of what i need to do daily & what i want to do more of. it's basically like a game, you can level up, get xp & rewards when you've done your tasks/habits you want to take up, lose hp if you miss deadlines/daily tasks
1	So many alarms on my phone. It's kind of absurd but I'd forget everything otherwise. I go through times of checking out though, where I intentionally don't get anything done I'm supposed to, no matter how small. It's one of my biggest flaws. 
1	I learned to make a weekly calendar plan in college. I print it out and stick it on the wall where I can see it every day when I walk in my front door.
1	I don't really like to rush my goals, but if I were to have a goal, I would have to start slow and give myself a lot of rest days as well. Start slow would be key, gradually increase as you go along. I find myself breaking more easily because I went full throttle on the first step, be it fitness or be it doing my own programming projects. 
1	I use a planner everyday I log things to do, goals and accomplishments in it and try to follow it every day. I find being able to look at it and check it off helps
1	**motivating yourself to make long-term committments:** you have to learn to enjoy things that you have mentally classified as "work"/"obligations." they are still work but you have to have SOME positive associations when you think of them rather than just negative/punitive motivations. "i will get fired/unhealthy/nowhere in life if i don't do this" is a negative thought that depresses you and shuts down your motivation. reframe it to the point where you're thinking of visceral enjoyable things when you're reminded of that obligation. *i don't like going to the gym, but i might see someone cute there. i'm really bad at writing, but i can show it to my friend later and we can make fun of it. i'm really tired right now, but i can picture myself being more energetic once i make some coffee and get started, and i can also picture myself sleeping better tonight.* focusing on the rewards is important because when you're tired, when you're in a bad mood, when you're sick, when you are mad at yourself, you're going to be more emotional and rely on instinctual/limbic decision making than when you're alert and in a good mood, when is typically when it's easier to get things done.\n\n**making a schedule:** notice what times of day you prefer certain activities and build around that. schedule blocks of tasks and breaks. try writing out your life for a week like you're in middle school and you have "periods," like 30 minutes or 1.5 hours or 3 hours, whatever works best for your attention span and lifestyle. then on a day-to-day basis, decide what activities need to get done and assign each a period of time. literally pretend you're in school and the administrator will not let you leave your workspace until the time has passed. this isn't a permanent way to live but it does get your mind USED to sustained work for a period of time, disciplining yourself to making that happen.\n\ntry finding a scheduling/daily task management app or website that you like and use it. there are really simple ones like [mytomatoes] or you can just buy a paper planner.\n\nwhen you're not feeling motivated enough or "in the mood" to do something you planned, swap it with something else that's productive rather than giving up entirely.\n\nlearn to enjoy the act of productivity itself and the rush of power you get from taking control of your life. /te pep talk
6	Characters you've been compared to?	The characters don't necessarily have to be ISFPs themselves. In fact, a lot of characters people have said I'm like I don't think share my type.\n\nPearl (Steven Universe)- ISTJ\n\nFluttershy- ISFP\n\nPocahontas- ISFP\n\nPrincess Aurora/Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty)- INFP\n\nCharlotte La Bouff (The Princess and the Frog)- ESFJ\n\nSibella (yes, the cute little vampire girl from Scooby Doo)- ISFJ?
2	The woman played by Janeane Garofalo in the movie 'The Truth About Cats and Dogs'
1	tibby from the sisterhood of the travelling pants (when I was in 7th grade, my teacher told me this)\n\nsome character in a crime drama show who's basically a sarcastic know it all.\n\nmy sister compared me to the girl in the book "white oleander" once\n\nhermione
8	ISFPs, do you consider yourself to have deeper emotional needs? In other words, would you say you are picky when it comes to receiving love? Are you easily happy with what you get or do you strive to be super-cherished (lol) and pampered more than others in a loving relationship?	
7	to really and truly love is more important than to be loved\n\nthe problem is most people settle for the idea or spectre of love and never really truly love another person in such a way that it sustains itself, and is happy to do so, without return\n\nit seems to me a lot of people love on condition of concurring love; they meet eachother halfway, and what they find loveable is that thing that loves them in return.  to me I may seem demanding because I want to admire a person independent of how they feel about me, because to condition it in such a way seems unnatural.  I want to love them for who they are and if that includes loving me back so be it.  in that sense, my love is "demanding" because it presumes to judge whether or not a person is worthy aside from the fact that we're both "trying in a relationship"--rather it centers on only my feelings towards them apart from such commitments or effort.  its self centered in its own way, but when you find such a love it is unbreakable because it doesn't ask anything in return except the other person be themselves\n\nin general what passes for love these days is a mutual commitment of both parties to *not* be themselves for the sake of the other.  I reject that, because that love is fundamentally a sleight of hand as far as I can tell. it cannot sustain itself except in the presence of the other and has no permanent basis.  the truest love in my mind is that which stands absolute, but such a love requires that person be, in their core, someone who elicits such a feeling and that is a very high barrier, whereas the love that requires only mutual commitment could basically be fulfilled by anyone\n
2	 I'm pretty simple/straightforward when it comes to what I expect. i dislike huge dramatic displays of affection, especially in public/around other people. People who make out in public are like... idk. Like no one wants to see that. \n\nobviously i want the person to respect me and be loyal and have my back. but i don't need to be worshiped. i'm pretty down to earth.
1	I want to be super cherished, pampered. \n\n"Picky when receiving love?"\n\nWhat you mean? Lol.\n\nI mean all I want is to be prioritized as the most important person/thing.  I want them to show this by always being on my side no matter what. \n\nBecause  isn't that the whole point of being someone's lover/So? \n\nIt's probably what most Feeler's  wants in an monogamous relationship too lol. \n
1	I want to be super pampered and cherished. Does that make me picky? Deeper emotional needs? I guess other people don't want to be cherished? haha :) the problem with this is comparing. It's really not relevant because each person has various needs. How can you say do you have too much need? A need is a need. Are some people more needy? Do you have deeper sexual needs? hehe financial needs? I think it probably varies with everyone. I shy away from too much or too little. I've had people say I'm too loud and others say I'm too quiet. :) I just gotta be me!
1	Everyone has deeper emotional needs. And yes, this particular isfp loves to be pampered :) I want someone who admires, respects, and understands me very well (more than I understand myself?). Obviously they have to be very attracted to me as well. I'm really picky. I want someone who can talk to me without awkwardness and someone who is my kindred spirit. I want someone who makes me want to become a better person for them.
6	Have you ever been a rebound or were in a reboud relationship?	Hi everyone! I was wondering if ISFP have the tendency to enter rebound relationships as initiators or if they are themselves more often "victims" of such a relationship? Does it last, does it not? Did it eventually turn out a "real thing"? Thank you in advance for your insights.
2	Personally, as an ISFP I feel that after my relationship ended (about a year ago) I couldn't bring myself to enter into another one. I did date to distract myself, but nothing stemmed from them. I also found myself unable to form romantic connections with another guy. Of course post relationship actions would also be effected by what kind of past relationship you had.  \nAlso, I would never let myself enter a "rebound relationship"; mentally I know that it would be better to take time to love myself not based on someone else's admiration for me and to rediscover how to live alone. \nLastly,(in the sense of being someone else's rebound) as someone mentioned previously, "I see that shit coming from a mile away" as in, come on, it's just not a good idea to date someone that just came out of a relationship. Not only are they probably just looking for someone to fill the hole that their ex partners left, if I really cared about them I would understand that it would benefit them more to have some alone time to figure out how to be themselves again.\n\ntldr: my thoughts as an ISFP on rebounds, bad idea
1	[deleted]
1	uh,,, i think someone might have *tried* to use me as a rebound but I seen't that shit coming a mile away. 
1	yes, until I noticed the pattern and stopped it.\n\nI seemed to only get people who were just out of relationships or otherwise emotionally unavailable who were interested for the long time. \n\nWhether that's a a function of ISFP or just a stage in my life im not sure.. 
1	I've been a rebound and it's soul crushing.
1	Every relationship I've had has been a rebound (I'm his rebound). The first one lasted over a year. The second one lasted about 2 weeks. In both situations, I knew what I was getting into and I knew it wouldn't work out but it's was nice to feel needed even if it wasn't real. 
6	Game recommendation for you guys.	What Remains of Edith Finch, I think you will enjoy it a lot :)
2	Assuming you liked it, what did you specifically like about it? Why do you think we would like it? (imma need a little more details to be convinced) (We're all a type but we are different people) (:P)
4	What would the world be like without editing? or life? (slightly philosofical)	I basically dislike editing. Is there anyone here who likes it, if so comment below and I will hire you when I get rich. :) Also, reddit with windows phone is irritating. Let's talk about auto correct. Actually I'll just produce my stuff without edits from now on. Why does my phone keep correcting philosophical to philesofical? At any rate, it sounds right. And my phone thinks it's right. haha

1	What does this have to do with the ISFP personality? 
7	ISFP Guys, Do you have trouble keeping long term friendships with women?	I don't have many friends that are women. Mainly because my brain is always on the motive of eventually dating the girl I'm friends with. Like I could see myself being really good friends with a woman but then I wouldn't see a point not to date her. It's to the point where if a woman strait up said to me that she wasn't interested in a relationship, I would simply loose interest and wouldn't be friends with her.\n\nAnyone else have a similar problem?
9	I think the problem might come from the fact that when we get the spark of a crush with someone, we tend to think so fondly and deeply about the person, it gets disappointing when it wears off. In my case, even when I realize friendships are not as deep as I thought they were, I am just so disappointed I tend to draw away. Still though, you should probably just analyze it a little bit. Did you feel like you connected to the person in some ways? What did you like about the person? There is always something to learn from other people. If you focus on their positive traits and the nice moments you lived together, you'll learn how to appreciate people more. Of course that only works if you felt a connexion in the first place.
3	While I don't have a lot of close female friends, I don't find it hard to do. Its not much different than having male friends honestly. Sure you can have fun and get along together, but then there is certain traits you dislike about your friends. My best friends like the same games, music, and sports that I like, but they complain a lot, can be self righteous, say dumb shit too often, etc. I wouldn't want to date someone with those traits; I'd still be friends with them though.  
1	I have some female friends and they've mainly come into my life through me first being friends with a guy friend of theirs, and then they've been invited into our friend group. So I'm never the one that invites girls to our group because I never get close enough to them; I never really pursue girls because I don't want to get out of my way to do it. Aside from work I don't use enough time between my friends and alone time to do things that would involve girls. My friends and I spend most of our time doing things just together by ourselves so I should find time to meet new girls. The limited ones I've been exposed up until now have never been girlfriend material so I need to widen my horizons. Anyway, for now I kind of have trouble with that because one of the two girls I hang out with are because of a common friend. I don't think I would hang out with either of the girls if it weren't for our shared friend group. I do like them but not as much as I like the group itself or some in it. But that might just come to change soon. So yes, I have that problem. I think I need to be more open and maybe that can help you too?
1	I can if they are dating someone or if I am dating someone. But yeah both single it is hard for me not to see it that way.
10	Trying too hard in relationships because they hate being alone	I recently met this girl on tinder and after talking for about three days, we have a shit ton in common. Turns out she's a INFP. She's been great in convos and she isn't in the slightest a boring person. \n\nShe just recently got out of a taxing relationship and she said that she wasn't looking to start a new relationship right away for a while. She says she would like to just do her own thing for a bit. \n\nI get very emotional when I'm lonely and especially when other people don't talk to me. I know she doesn't hate me, but my conscience says she does because that's just how my brain assumes when people don't talk to me. Its probably because I don't know her that well. I guess I just expect too much from people that I meet. \n\nAnyone else have these problems?
7	Your emotional stability will never be truly validated from another person. So even if the other person was cool with doing needed to feel better, it would never be enough or it would be fleeting. I'd focus on being content with yourself and only getting to know people you feel you can trust. Don't develop strong feelings for someone before you really know who the person is, because it's easy for us isfps to idealize whenever we have feelings that could someday lead to love. We love love. 
3	Don't think of it as being alone. Think of it as solitude.
2	I've been with my boyfriend for two years and I still have to ask him everyday if he still loves me. I feel like us ISFPs can be draining at times for other people because we do have emotional needs. Just try not to take it personally and give her some time. 
1	For a while I was like you, feeling "empty" without a relationship. But it's something that you can turn around. I've been single going on 3 years now and in that time I've learned that it's not only possible to be happy without a relationship, but it's fantastic.
7	INTP here, interested in ISFP	Seeing as how dead and forsaken this sub is and how I'm genuinely perplexed by this ISFP and need help, why not.\n\nLong story short, a little more than a month ago I met this ISFP girl. I'm 99% certain she is ISFP, she fits all the stereotypes and all the things associated with ISFP behavior that I have scoured the entire internet including the farthest reaches for in true INTP fashion. She fits it to a T. Theoretically, INTP/ISFP is never supposed to work right from the start and is one of the harder pairs to bring together, but I believe that is bullshit and with the right respect, communication, and sacrifice from any two people, any mbti combination can make it work.\n\nSince then, we've hung out every single weekend(already have plans for next weekend), and my feelings for her have blossomed. She's genuine, a great listener, puts me at ease, and her sense of the moment is amazing to me, probably because I live in my own head too much. I don't even care that she'd rather not listen to my intellectual banter and keep it to myself instead, I just focus on her strengths and appreciate what she brings to the table.\n\nThe problem is that I can't read her locked, heavily guarded closed book. It bothers me because she doesn't show any signs of interest, like at all. She is extremely, extremely good at it, and I can't tell whether it's her ISFP superpower of properly managing the outward radiance of her emotions or she just isn't interested in me. The numerous times we've hung out, I feel like nothing but a simple friend to her. On the other hand, I think I have given enough signals to show that I'm interested, such as going to great lengths to help her plan her extended trip overseas, even gifting her stuff she needed to take with her. She's quite slow paced and feeble-minded(for lack of a better word), and I am more than willing to use my Ti and logic to help her with anything. I do little things here and there(cause I know ISFPs appreciate action more than words) to convey how I feel. Matter of fact, I feel like I've done so much(my ability to solve problems with ease has been a welcome addition to her disorderly and reckless way of diving into things without thinking it seems) I need to scale back the charity before I scare her off.\n\nBut even then, she hasn't done anything to reciprocate. It bothers me and drives me crazy. Normally I'm really good at noticing subtle cues that girls give off that scream interest, as I've had a fair share of girls in the past(unfortunately mostly ESFJ, ESFP). But when it comes to her, she shows absolutely nothing.\n\nIf it means anything, I asked her to be my date to a wedding I'm attending next month, and she said yes. I sorta used it as a cry for help, because we are both vegan and I didn't want to sit with hundreds of carnivores alone at this wedding convention and wanted some company, but she nodded almost immediately. Now I'm not sure if she's just being a really supportive friend or sees it as an excellent opportunity to further our relationship. If she truly isn't interested in me, I don't think she would have agreed to such a thing because of the wrong implications that come with deciding to partake in such a thing with me...\n\nIs all of this simply because she is still in the process of warming up to me? I understand that ISFPs seek long term partners and not flings. Will she eventually reciprocate further down the road? I want to bring up questions to set things straight between the two of us because I don't want to drag things on just to be hurt in the end. But I don't want to blow it too early. Is one month too short of a time period to judge, and should I give her more time to process how she feels inside(Fi)? I'm so perplexed on what to do, any advice offered is greatly appreciated.\n\n
15	Oh boy. Ok first off, feebleminded? hahaha oh where would she be without you? In my experience, opposites attract but don't do well over the long haul. You think it's a fit, that she completes you. You are ready to make a sacrifice. So first logical question is why wouldn't you find a relationship that wasn't going to be a lot of work and sacrifice? The fact that she has qualities that "match" you and you help her and she's not reciprocating tells me that you are looking to put 2 halves together to make a whole. You don't need to figure her out, you need to figure yourself out. Stop seeing yourself and her as limited in any way. Then come together as two wholes.
11	>I'm 99% certain she is ISFP, she fits all the stereotypes and all the things associated with ISFP behavior that I have scoured the entire internet.\n\nThose isfp stereotypes mostly aren't accurate.\n\nBut if she is an isfp, I have this to say:\n\nYou seem not to know much about her. Like you put her on a pedestal (and we all do that) but you also seem to have a whole storyline in your head that is very much like a fairytale (the prince saves the princess, but the princess's personality isn't really revealed), because you seem to like "rescuing" her. The way your talk about her and your vision reminds me of Tom from 500 Days of Summer. I'm not trying to be mean-- this is what I see. \n\nAlso, when you do figure her out will you still be interested? Will you still like her or will the infatuation wear off? We are Fi dominant. That is your weakest function so maybe that's why you find her mysterious and interesting. Maybe you feel like you can learn from her Fi? \n\nYou asked "Do you find that her constant lack of interest in your intellectual obsession of the moment unfulfilling? Do you ever tire of the shallow level conversations, depressingly nonexistent on the topics of philosophy and the edge of the universe? What is it about her that keeps the bond going strong?" Ti is what defines you, so I don't understand how you could compromise this. I would actually like to know. Also, I looked at your old posts and you mentioned that you wouldn't be able to be without an N type for life. \n\nFi is what defines us, so it's important for us that our SO understand us to the core, and that we feel like we can be authentic in front of them. I tend to connect with stronger Fi users than Fe. In fact, I do not really understand Fe. That said, some parts of your post seem rather sweet. And the Fe shows in your actions.\n\nThis relationship will take a lot of effort and you should be 100% sure you like her core before getting her hopes up. When we get hurt or rejected, its hard for us to open up again to anyone. \n\n\n\n
4	Just....tell her you really like spending time with her and ask her if she wants to go on an actual date.  Not that hard.  She's probably not going to be the one to take initiative, so you should just go for it.  Save yourself the agony of wondering if she likes you or not.\n\nAlso, small note, but I would stop attempting to fix all her problems.  She might like being disorderly and whatnot.  If she asks for your help then go ahead, go for it, but let her do her thing otherwise.  ISFPs generally like to feel independent so she might not enjoy all the handholding in the long run.
3	*ahem*\n\nWhat's up intp bromigo? I've got some anecdotal experience here. Isfp got you too huh? I won't give too many personal details about myself because I'm a paranoid, crazy asshole, but the intp perspective should make up for that. \n\nSo, I started off in a different way. We slowly got to know each other, actually before I even knew about mbti. Over 4 and a half years, we grew on each other after 1, started developing "the liking" after 2, actually started conversating more after 3, and I told her I was interested after 4. I know the feelings are mutual, but she's yet to actually "say" so, if that clues you into how important it is to read actions (don't over analyze though!!!). \n\nThat said, she's choosing to share her time with you. What does that action tell you? I think both of our types have a similar perspective and value on "me time". Again, don't overanalyze. Get used to not having things spelled out for you because she won't suddenly "spit it out" clearly. That's not to say she can't, but in my experience, their words don't paint the verbal picture that they want. You'll have to take your time and see what the pattern of behavior points to. \n\nThat last sentence is important because you need to draw the line in your head. Enjoy the moment and reflect on new experiences, but try to recognize when you have nothing left to analyze. Over analysis will have you stuck and stressed. \n\nAlso, be careful with helpful suggestions. We naturally find problems and immediately want to problem solve, but this can come off the wrong way. The isfp way is kind of "whatever, it is what it is - just jump into it", but hell if doesn't work out more often than not. Just shut up and believe haha. \n\nFuck, I spend way too much time on this sub. I need to get away. Anyway, I got you with any questions if you excuse the gaps between responses 
3	imagine you are her, and then see what you would be thinking about. this is easy as fuck imo. plus ppl have thought patterns. maybe when someone snaps they are thinking about a certain thing (I do this). It is very easy to read ppl imo (ISTP), I get bored with everyone except immediate family members really fast soon as I try to "distill" them\n\nIf someone is going on multiple dates with you there is a 99% chance they like you so be cool
3	Some simple advice that I can give as a ISFP lady. I suggest being direct and honest about your feelings for her without putting pressure on her to give an immediate response. Make it clear that you are interested in her romantically, and then let her decide if she wants to pursue something with you. It takes me a while to decide as I'm a bit indecisive and have a hard time interpreting my feelings sometimes. \n\nAlso, this is a really bad defense mechanism, but sometimes I'm almost rude to someone I'm interested in, almost to see if they'll "fight" for me and try really hard to be with me. I'm not sure if that's a universal ISFP thing, but I definitely send mixed signals and can be hard to understand. Hope this helps.
2	post as often as you wish here, this sub is dead
2	I don't know if this isn't normal for ISFPs as I am kind of isolated and lacking friends at this time in my life, but I think it's always been the case that I make it very obvious if I like a person. My face lights up, I can get excitable and jumpy and start stuttering or blushing. That can mean romantic interest or otherwise. If she is showing no interest you probably don't want to waste your time.
4	doing a survey	Which way does the tp go on? Under or over? Which way does the silverware go in the dishwasher? Business end up or down? Or, it doesn't matter. :)
3	Haha, over, and up. 
3	TP over because it's easier to tear.\n\nSilverware with the utensil part down and the handle up so I can take them out of the dishwasher without touching the part that goes in your mouth.
2	TP over is the only answer. Silverware with the business part up because it won't touch the pooling water in my sink, but I'd accept the opposite. ISFP here
2	i dont give a shit about these things. not even a little. 
4	question to the universe atm	Every time I try to set up a boundary, I end up torn with guilt. Whyyy? That is my question to the universe right now. I am so confused. I need help. I need to be able to have boundaries for crying out loud. At this point I'm trying to figure out if it's just me. Anyhow, does anyone have any input about boundaries? I'm listening.haha and tia. Anyone who answers I will pull up one card from my tarot deck and have some fun and free analysis haha. :) I won't predict the future. I use it for life path work.
3	I'm a pretty guilt-heavy isfp too, you just have to remind yourself that you deserve to set up boundaries in any way you see fit, if it makes your life better. Also as the other comment said, if you're feeling guilty because it's hurting someone, take a look at the boundaries you're setting and see if they're healthy.
3	I was hurting myself by not having boundaries in a friendship and it was causing me a lot of anxiety I also knew that if I chose to create boundaries she wouldn't want to be my friend anymore. So what did I do? I sucked it up till I hit a breaking point. \n\nTwo weeks ago I gave her my boundaries, things I would not talk to her about. It was only one thing but I guess it was too much? Because she immediately said we couldn't be friends. At the moment it sucked. I lost a what I always believed to be a close friend, and I felt guilty. But now, in the present, I have zero regrets. I'm still a little depressed, but my state of mind is loads better with the unnecessary stress she gave me out of the picture. \n\nIt's not the same scenario but it is an example\n\nSo setting boundaries is hard, but it's really for yourself in the long run and if someone else can't deal with it then that's their problem and not yours 
2	Pfft unlikely. She's been ignoring me since I tried to create boundaries. I can get in a hello, which she answers if someone else is in the room, but man...I don't trust her anymore and I can't be friends with someone I can't trust.

9	I Hurt an ISFP.	
12	ISFPs are pretty conflict-avoidant so if she really went as far as to go full-blown no contact with blocking then I'd consider it done.  This is likely an accumulation of multiple things in the past that you and maybe she herself might not really be aware of. (maybe the past incidents?)  Even if she does forgive you at some point, she's never going to forget this happened.  Keep in mind that part of owning up to your mistake is realizing that you might not be forgiven.\n\nIf she does forgive you, I would not try to justify yourself or deflect the blame.  The way you're wording things here sound like you're blaming her for being hurt by these things.  She was hurt by this, but I didn't know. I was too intrusive but my intentions were pure..etc.  You fucked up and it doesn't matter how good your intentions were.\n\nTo be honest, it sounds like this friendship has run its course.  If you guys are having fall outs all the time then it's probably best to let this go.  Don't obsess over it.
4	Unfortunately, it's really hard to get trust back once it's been lost. It's probably too soon to try to reconcile. Maybe you should write some pages of complimentary attributes and positives because I believe we need to feel valued. If you took the time to do that, that may help. The more, the better. That will show that she is important to you. As we also like action more than words. We really like to be understood but maybe just acceptance would be enough.
2	The fact that she left because you typed her suggest to me she already had one foot out the door in this friendship. Don't beat yourself up on it. 
1	my advice, don't put this level of effort in people. occasionally they will come back to you haha. and you can always befriend more ppl, friendships are like a revolving door- 1 in, 1 out
5	How you're sabotaging your life - do you agree with this article and how would you explain this to an isfp?	
3	ahhh the ISFP is a lot like me....I'm avoiding a lot of things right now.  Procrastination to the max.
2	i relate more to the ENTJ one actually
2	Well the ISFP one definitely rings a bell as I've wasted almost a decade through addiction/depression, while I've been chronically avoiding conflict that would enable me to change from my neurotic-tormented self image. I've read somewhere that unahppiest ISFP's are those who are passive - I sure as hell am one.
1	>When things start heating up, you’d rather make yourself scarce than you stick around and work things out—which means that some of the greatest adventures of your life never happen, because you’re too busy hiding from potential clashes.\n\n\nYUP
12	Draining	Is this an isfp trait. Everytime I see someone arguing and fighting, it's emotionally draining. While everyone smiling and laughing I'm just sitting here drained. Is this an isfp trait.
10	INFP here with my opinion...\n\nYes, for ISFPs and INFPs alike, we lead with a cognitive process called introverted feeling, and an important part of us is an awareness of everything we do coming from a sincere and authentic place inside. It makes us sensitive to two things in particular that you are discussing:\n\n**Emotionally charged situations** - we understand all of the nuances of emotions so we can get drained from processing all of the feelings that take place in others during arguments.\n\n**Superficial interactions** - since we tend to, or at least prefer to, act only in ways that reflects what is going on inside of us, we can have internal red flags that go off when we see people interacting in ways that don't seem authentic. It's my opinion this "superficial interaction" is a necessary part of functioning society and a requirement for other types, but for people who lead with introverted feeling like INFPs and ISFP, this leads to exhaustion because we tend to process emotional exchanges between people more in-depth than your typical person prefers to by default. So when we're in situations where everyone is in a room sharing a laugh, it may take a while for us to catch up with what's going on since we are taking a bit more time to process all of the emotions that are flying about the room.\n\nTo answer your question, I believe the answer is yes. You're being yourself and that's a good thing. Just make sure that you mentally separate yourself from your environment and to respect and give yourself what you need in these situations while also giving respect to others.
2	What is your Favourite activities to do? [Asking Other SP's]	List your MBTI type and your favorite activities to do.\nI'll list mine. Having as it comes adventures (sneaking into places etc), Learning about things I like (The Bible, Charisma, NLP, hypnosis, different sorts of skills ect), Weightlifting, Skateboarding, baseball, running around, Minecraft <3, Talking with a friend or two, Chess and other strategic games, Eating good food, Learning about health things, Reddit, Funny videos and documentaries about things in my scope of interests. Also airsoft and being a libertarian.\n\n\nEdit: we SP's need a convention or a meet up to get to know each other. We are so much fun and adventurous!
3	Learning, yes! Adventures! Strategy! Yes! Yes! Good food 😋 cheesecake and not just any cheesecake, but I wouldn't say no to any one. Yes, to most. I agree. We'd make great companions. I wonder where we should have it. :)
1	Riding my bike. Reading a book at times. 
13	You may not be an ISFP	Neurotic ESFP's can seem introverted as they can be scared of failure and rejection. Personally I thought I was introverted but I just think at the speed of light, and I'm scared of failure.\n\nYou can also be an highly sensitive extrovert, which may seem introverted.
8	I thought I was an ISFP for ages until i posted a type me post in r/mbti and a few peeps said I was ESFP. Did some more research. Agreed I was ESFP. Went through something emotionally scarring. Saw a psych. Been working on confidence for about 6 months now. Now, so much more confident. And louder.\n\nAaaand there's my life story.\n\ntldr; yeah bro, I agree :)
3	I'm not sure about my type at all. I'm torn between ISFP, ISTP, ESFP, ISFJ and least likely INFP.\nI share traits of all these types and I sometimes come here because I can kinda relate to the "chill" atmosphere of this sub. I also don't fit the "artist" stereotype at all although it is said that "Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees."\n\nAlso why out of the sudden a post like this? "You may not be an ISFP" seems weird to me :D\nIt's not like we're some special snowflakes.
3	This is a good post, as I know a few ESFPs who mistyped as ISFPs. But I don't think that it applies to me because my Se is very low key (I even mistyped as INFP for years). 
2	I waffle back and forth depending on how comfortable I'm feeling. I'm normally ISFP in new/uncomfortable situations, but once I'm confident I switch to ESFP. 
1	What????? haha ok so you freaked me out there for a minute. Is it possible an introvert could be perceived as neurotic by an extrovert? Neurotic is chronic anxiety and I believe it's no longer a psychiatric diagnosis. An introvert is going to be prone to anxiety if they are in a social environment all day. Ok I lost my point. Ok I remembered it. I was worried I was a neurotic extrovert. Some questions you could ask yourself. Do you generally like books or people better? Are you practical? Do you feel energized after family visits? Ok now I'm having an identity crisis. Ok here's the thing. It's a spectrum so you aren't exactly one thing or another. You are going to tend to go to one side over the other. I'm a neurotic introvert haha

10	college majors! (+ question for comp sci students)	hello fellow ISFPs!\n\ni'm at community college at the moment and aiming to transfer the next fall. i don't have much of a clear idea at all what i wanna do but i just wanna transfer somewhere. so my ISFP brothers and sisters, what did you/are you going to major in?\n\nand for my ISFP comp sci people, how did you feel about the major? is it true that you have to be really passionate about it to succeed at the end of the day? i like coding but i can't see myself at the level of most other students. what were your experiences?\n\nany and all comments appreciated guys! have a great day :D
4	Public Health Major here. Although I started out as a mechanical engineer. I'd be happy to answer more questions about it.
3	Honestly I'm surprised at the number of people here on this forum who are pursuing computer science. I thought more would be pursuing arts/humanities. (I know being an ISFP doesn't preclude you from pursuing a STEM career, but it just seemed a bit odd.)\n\nI am currently a nursing major, and I'm trying to stay afloat until the end of this semester :)
3	Comp Sci Junior here. It's alright, I suppose. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. I'm a little worried about finding a job when I graduate, but my GPA is okay so who knows. I wouldn't say you have to be passionate about it to succeed in CS, at least I'm school. At the very least, at my school anyways, it's pretty laid back compared to other majors, from what I've heard, so it's okay by me.
3	Ex-CS major here! I go to a big STEM school and honestly didn't really know what to do with myself when I found out I got in (mostly because I wasn't huge in academics in high school), but I initially picked CS because of the job security. After a couple semesters I didn't feel like it was a good fit for me and switched to something design/liberal arts related. For me personally, I have to feel at least somewhat invested in my coursework, otherwise I have trouble staying motivated, but YMMV. Getting me to study something I have 0 interest in is like pulling teeth :P\nThat being said, definitely try out comp sci and see how you like it. It's a great field with lots of opportunities. Every CS program is different and if it's a good fit for you there's no reason you can't succeed. 
2	yo\n\n i am going to be majoring on CS\n\ntho it is not a stereotypical major one would expect for an ISFP, CS is fun, rewarding, and pays very well. I really do not like coding but I like challenges and working with a team. i am doing well professionally with internships and such despite being a shitty programmer.\n\nalso at my uni, people with > 3.5 GPA have > 95% employment rates, and the median pay 5 years after college is $80k i think, which is double the median salary in my state (indiana), so quite quite good.
2	I love computer science. I'm a current freshman who is almost done with my first year, and so far it's been great! It does seem weird to be so into a technical field as an ISFP, which is what at first dissuaded me from thinking I was an ISFP, especially since none of the tests I took said I was an ISFP (After a long discussion with a few friends, we came to this conclusion). I think what really made me realize why I loved CSC was because of being able to create things and bring them into reality. Once you learn to code, you can do so much and a whole new level of creativity is opened because you can actually make stuff. Plus, even though there is logic and problem solving, you have to think of an efficient and readable way to implement things. Just setting up code is an art in itself honestly, and you develop a personal way of doing things.
8	I'm not sure if I'm ISFP or INFP help?	I'm not really sure of how to sum myself up. I just know between tests, and other people I seem to get typed as both. I have originally thought I was INFP, but then lately people have been telling me I seem more ISFP. \n\nAs I said I'm not great at summing myself up, but I'll answer any questions if they help to give some insight?\n\nAlso I'm willing to hear on perhaps what are some huge, differences between ISFP's, and INFP's.\n\nPlease, and thank you.

7	Questioning the accuracy of online descriptions	Just to make it clear, the online anecdotes about each type are often pretty one sided and flaunt stereotypes (though sometimes it's like someone spat back my entire life at me.) But point aside, I have found the ISFP descriptions even in Kiersey's book they seem to peg ISFPs as mostly-chill emo artists and irl as I have had more encounters with ISFPs and gained more knowledge of mbti, I have found that not to be true at all.\n\nBut the main question is have you all found the ISFP description to be especially vague?
8	Yes. \n\nMost descriptions make us seem like INFPs but with less of a personality. I don't relate to being an artist at all (my "art" is terrible) and it seems like everyone tries to make it sound like all ISFPs are artists. A lot of people tend to not get to the heart of what an ISFP is about, so they just throw on very vague descriptions.
1	Often, yes, but we don't cry at every disagreement, stubbed toe, or used tissue like they make us sound.\nIn fact, like every other human being, we have logic, common sense, and do not operate solely on "feelings". Our Fi derives from *personal values*, not "bases every decision off of whatever I feel at the time". (Sometimes I *really* wonder what ISFPs the author has met because a lot of them make us sound like second graders). I think this is at least partly why other types like to mock and dismiss by going "Found the Fi-dom!" any time we show a strong opinion they disagree with.\n\nAlso, almost every ISFP description sounds sort of stereotypically girly: artsy, shy, sweet, sensitive, like messing with our hair/clothes/makeup. And that's great if you're feminine (a lot of us are!) but it almost sounds like the author is directing speaking to/about female ISFPs and also forgets that some women are tomboys. And while both men and tomboyish women can do some of those aforementioned things, it never feels like the description is taking them into account. I can't really explain it more clearly.
12	Are you all or nothing when it comes to relationships/friendships?	
9	i am "nothing" in both yea
6	What do you mean by all or nothing exactly...?  Like if they don't reciprocate in a similar manner then it's better not to be friends at all?
3	Now that I think about it... that's exactly me. Regarding friendships anyway.
2	Yes :) 
2	Not sure what you mean but I'm still pretty certain the answer is no. I loathe burning bridges.
1	For me there has to be a lot of value there so it's kinda like all or nothing.
5	Anyone else like ESFJs?	I am wondering if anybody has any thots on this pairing romantically. As I have been learning more about socionics I have confirmed that my Fe / Si are nil haha.
2	I think they're underrated online. They help make the world go round but xSFJs get so much unnecessary hate. I think some of it comes from misunderstanding mbti and judging based on dumb stereotypes (like ESFJs are all Regina George or hyper conservative old gossipy ladies). \n\nSo I do, but if I'm to be frank I do find some Fe doms a but tiring at times, because some of them I've known don't really have much social intuition and like putting me on the spot to make comments or something. Don't dislike at all though. 
1	Absolutely not. My friend from work is an ESFJ. I am definitely not her.
1	[deleted]
1	It all depends on the ESFJ and what they're like. 
1	My boyfriend is ESFJ and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna marry him someday. I think we're a pretty good match.
1	Married with esfj, met her in Art school 10 years ago, she's my rock and I will always love her.
4	Not sharing personal fi values?	So with Fi essentially being a system of personal values, it would stand to reason that Fi doms would share their values.\n\nHowever, if the Fi user's personal values don't align with other values then this can start conflict by seeming as judgmental.\n\nI have noticed that any time I talk about my personal values (hard work / discipline / reliability / professionalism / self-confidence / ambition) people act very offended because no one else has these values it seems these days.
3	Maybe when you're talking about those things, people think you're secretly chastising them for not having those values?  That's the only thing I can think of anyway.  I find it hard to talk about values like that out loud because then it'll inevitably end up with me comparing myself with other people - my worst nightmare lol.
0	Come chat about personality typology	Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.\n\nSee you there (:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/6xE4qMt\nEdit: If that link expires, use this one: https://discord.gg/ct8BRps
22	Bias against sensors	Does anyone else notice a bias against sensors? Most mbti descriptions sound like they were written by intuitive types who don't really understand how sensors think, and portray us as the less intelligent types. Many people don't seem to understand that N and S signify how you think, not how smart you are. Many intuitive types on mbti forums seem to have this bias too. I'm probably going to get downvoted a lot because the majority of users on reddit are probably N types (I think many of them mistyped themselves though), but it's something I want to talk about so I don't really care. \n\nedit: I was actually going to delete this post right after I wrote it but I'm glad I didn't. Thanks for the discussion. :)
19	It's sad to see a tool like MBTI used for ego boosting and further division between people instead of trying to understand each other.
6	Yea, I definitely see that. I have nothing to actively contribute to this discussion with, but that's not just you, it's happening.
6	Oh absolutely.  The amount of times I've seen "DAE sensors are dumb????" in MBTI communities is downright ridiculous.  I don't understand why the bias even exists.  When I first got involved in MBTI I thought there would be more so a bias towards introverts over extroverts, and maybe a bias towards thinkers over feelers.  It's not that these biases don't exist to a certain extent, but the bias towards Ns is so much more pronounced.    \n\nEdit:  Another thing that makes me lol every time I see it come up, is when someone posts something like "I'm the only intuitive I know, and I'm surrounded by sensors.  It's a living hell".  
5	I see it happen a lot, though it's usually pretty subtle. I agree with you; a lot of sensors on Reddit mistype as Intuitives because it's seen as the "smart" group.\n\n*edit* BTW I'm an ENTJ
9	Oh, definitely. I've come to totally disregard those online quizzes because they're just so poorly written and yes, very biased toward intuitives. Dumb questions like "do you prefer small talk or discussing ~deep~ things?" One, why not both? Two, freaking everyone thinks they're deep, special, smart, everything the tests all but come out and say intuitives are. So really, no surprise everyone and their mom proudly claims to be an INxJ, the supposedly rarest types (which adds another layer to the special snowflake factor, I think).\n\nI advise people all the time to ignore the tests and just study the functions. They can be difficult, yes, but that's the accurate way to find your type. \n\nBuuuuut no, it's not about understanding themselves or other people. Most just want a special personality type as an ego boost.
4	I've noticed it on Reddit and many of the typing quizzes/tests, but not elsewhere. I don't get how intuitives get steretyped as smart and sensors as dumb. It makes zero sense and if anything I would think it would be the opposite, or most likely balanced. I would think the intelligence stereotype would be a thinker bias over feelers, yet oddly enough I haven't seen that.
5	I agree.  I think the way these descriptions get written make people mistype themselves a lot since being intuitive just sounds better.  It doesn't directly bother me that much (I haven't had anyone on any forum be weird at me for being a sensor - that just sounds rude) but it does bug me when people use it as an ego thing.  Your MBTI type seems to be a weird thing to be proud about.\n\nThat said, you're in an ISFP forum. I'm not sure why you think you'd be downvoted.
3	INFP here, I do have a bit of a bias aganst sensors which is absolutely unfair. I agree with everything you have said. I just built the bias due to bad experiences and really frustrating conversations, I am trying to keep an open mind and identify the bias when it comes up.  
2	*INFP checking in...*\n\nThis post really made me think.\n\nBeing honest, I wasn't aware that I looked down on sensors intellectually, until now.\n\nBeing honest again, I don't generally like the way sensors present perspectives and information, which is what I have an insatiable appetite for. \n\nHowever, that has been changing, since I've become more interested in developing skills in art, I find the way sensors describe the creative process captivating, insightful and inspiring. I am envious of the pre-disposition to which sensors have towards creative and physical expression.\n\nWhen talking to sensory in my family, it's like we are talking another language to one another, they seem puzzled by my inability to adopt their focus.\n\nI have noticed relatively recently though, after trying to reengage mindfulness, that there is an ocean of subtly and wisdom that can only come from centering in somatic experience, and the input of the senses. And sensors have a huge advantage when it comes to developing that, which is taking me a long time to develop.\n\nAlso, sensors seem to have a far better advantage when it comes to developing sports and artistic skills. 
1	I think it's interesting that you say that. The one is more concerned with the result and the other are more concerned with the procedure. That's the difference between the two types. They both get results. One is more methodical maybe. How does it get seen as smarter?
1	Yes there is a bias! Just as there is a bias towards S-types in sports and art. I'm an N type in the art industry! Let me have my happy time in MBTI.
5	Isfp x intp dating relationship?	I'm dating this guy and he identifies as an intp. I am wondering what everyone's experience is when it comes to a romantic relationship with that type
6	I'm engaged to one. Met him online and we've been together about eight years. He seriously just kills me sometimes though. \n\nThe bad: with contrasting functions, we process information differently, hold different values a lot. His Ti-Fe combo makes him nitpicky and love to argue (even though he denies that) and he doesn't really have much common sense. And his weak Fe can make him a bit clingy and often clashes with my dominant Fi. I won't do something that goes against my moral code no matter how many people agree or disagree with it, and he doesn't get that.\n\nBut now for the good: we have a lot of chemistry and I think we complement each other very well! Our differences keep things interesting. I love his mind. He's rarely biased about things and I can trust him to be honest when I ask for his opinion. I trust him and can talk to him about anything. \n\nI've learned to try to hold back my annoyance and anger and to appear calmer, and he'll be less likely to brush me off when we argue. I try to detach myself emotionally from the topic a bit and also make him see it from a different point of view, which I think with his Ne he can appreciate.
4	INTP male here. \n\nLolz, I actually came to this subreddit to ask this very question, with more specifics.  \n\nMy girlfriend is isfp and I really really like her, like head over heels, but I have concerns because idk if she actually feels much for me like I do for her because she's been hurt in the past. She has all these issues with her emotions and I guess I'm probably the first real boyfriend she's had since the one that made her like this. \n\nMy advice is to constantly reassure the INTP that you like them more than anyone else, even if it's not necessarily true, they will appreciate it so much. 
1	I can't speak for romantic relationships but I'm fairly certain my brother is INTP and we get along very well. But a sibling relationship is very different than a romantic one.
6	We promised we'd share the survey results, well here they are.	A while back, [we asked folks in this community to take a survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/5xbw1g/make_your_voice_heard_tired_of_phone_calls/) and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.\n\n(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term "[extravert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, "extrovert." )\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Movers & Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.\n\nAs an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers & Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but "Phase 1" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of "I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself." The possible answers included, "Call your phone number," "Send you an email," "Send you an SMS," "Send you an MMS," and "Send you an IM." We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.\n\n## Overall Preferences\n\nOur initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).\n\n[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)\n\nGranted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. \n\n### Introvert-Extravert Preferences\n\nBreaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.\n\n[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)\n\n[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)\n\nThe similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.\n\n#### Ambivert Preferences\n\nWhile "ambivert" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.\n\n[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)\n\n### Male-Female Preferences\n\nOur original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of "sex" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.\n\n[Male Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/VeC5EeV)\n\nOverall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.\n\n[Female Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/Npq6ZeS)\n\n#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders\n\nWe specifically did not include the word "gender" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of "Prefer not to say," and "Other" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.\n\nThat does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.\n\n### Generational Preferences\n\nThe first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call "Millennials" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to "alternative" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.\n\n[Millennial Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/fJBFPKj)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Generation X," or "Gen X," are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.\n\n[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Baby Boomers," or just "Boomers" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to "alternative" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.\n\n[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)\n\n### Occupational Preferences\n\nThe second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational "wings" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  \n\n[STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/QnwxZOc)\n\nResponses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.\n\n[non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/LMluzrF)\n\n## Scenario Preferences\n\nWe asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term "cold to hot" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.\n\nIt is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the "coldest" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.\n\n[Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/65J1a3r)\n\nAlso, predictably, the "hottest" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.\n\n[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)\n\nThe scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.\n\n[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)\n\nThe scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.\n\n[Hot Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/FbwgWnW)\n\n## Consequences\n\nWe were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, "I mostly roll with it--no big deal" (16.8%), "I find it irritating and frustrating" (24.3%), and "The interruption negatively affects my work" (16.5%), as well as, "I may decide not to reply or continue communication" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be "I lose some respect for the person contacting me" (7.3%), and "I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'" (6.5%).\n\n[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)\n\nConversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, "It helps me manage my schedule" (14.3%), "I feel I'm more productive and efficient" (13.9%), "I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication" (21.5%), "I'm less irritated" (20%), and "It reduces my anxiety" (18.8%).\n\n[Positive Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/laUXrVA)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOur initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. \n\nLooking at this research, we can see why "cold calling" feels ineffective and like "a waste of time" to many people. "Cold emails" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. \n\nYes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of "emergency" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.\n\nAs an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, "I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency." And, another comment, "I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious." These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. \n\nOur research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?\n\nAll of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.\n\nWe will begin "Phase 2" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers & Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please [contact us](mailto:researchers@moversandmakers.xyz); but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.\n\nYou can find a copy of this article over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michaelallenwilliamson/phone-call-or-email-or-informal-survey-results-a4d07e6c392a) if you'd like to read the article with the chart images in-line.
11	New Music: April 2017	So since we're supposed to be the cool kids who have awesome taste in music, and this sub seems to be pretty quiet, I thought each month maybe we could have a thread where everyone contributes to new music/music they've just discovered to share.\n\nI will post my spotify April playlist down below:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/brycarter_/playlist/3iYjcMz6Adcoq6V1KMuhNZ\n\nI realise we are 13 days into April, but better late than never! Let's see how this goes :)
3	I've just discovered Aural Vampire and I really love it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVkFLtCo19s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk8T87jdQ5Q\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQWgVpjoQYo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g11Dq9VtbM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgfJeIKzHQA\n\nThanks for making this thread btw :)
3	kendrick lamar, young money, juicy j- typical ESTJ music
2	Been listening to a lot of old indie songs recently, but I usually listen to any and everything. \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/sadsandwich/playlist/4FfGZZUDdzNJeCoJXNd0BA
2	Lucky Boys Confusion just came out with their first new album in many years. I have only listened to two songs so far, and I don't think they were their best work, but certainly good enough to get me excited for the rest of the album, which I'll likely listen to on my way home from work.\n\nOther than that, I've actually been listening to a lot of music from the '90s and '00s lately. Not sure why. Guess I've just been feeling nostalgic.
2	Loved these guys since '97 .. this new track is somewhat Rush-like : [Big Wreck - Skybunk Marche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLh7hKTLLc)
32	Do you find it difficult to express your thoughts?	 Sometimes I feel as though I can't speak English and often get tongue-tied when I'm trying to explain something.  Is this a cognitive issue or something related to our personality type? It seems to be a recent thing as I am now interacting with more people at my job. 
13	Same here. Give me a million years to write something out, anything really, a text or a paper or a reddit comment, and I can usually think of how I want to say things in a way that actually makes sense. But put me under the time limit of speaking aloud without awkward thinking pauses, and suddenly I forget half the words in my vocabulary.
11	I'm the same way but I've always thought it was more of a cognitive thing. I get all twisted and forget words when I'm under any sort of pressure. I turn dyslexic. It's awful. I can't do public speaking. 
6	Yeah I can relate. I think that Fi-Se makes communication with words very difficult. 
4	I had this problem in every conversation. Then I took a critical thinking a composition English class in college. Now I take my time when I speak and I couldn't be happier. Also writing got really fun
3	I get the same. Its like I know what I want to say but tge thoughts are just to overwhelming and at that moment I cant get anything out. 
2	I have no idea if it's a personality type thing, but yes, absolutely. It may be a driving force in why I'm quiet and reserved much of the time. On paper I can usually express myself alright enough, because I'm able to think and reword things as I see fit. But there are still times that I word things awkwardly and can't figure out how to express my idea better. It often leads to me rambling and saying the same thing five times worded differently. Sometimes I wish I could just open up my head and transmit the idea or sentiment I'm thinking of without using words.
2	I can definitely relate lol When I'm typing something, I sound like a coherent human adult, or I just send pictures of what I'm talking about/feeling. BUT when I try to express myself verbally - I often sound like a complete idiot -.- I don't know if it's because I get nervous or something, but when I'm talking (not all the time, but enough for it to be noticeable to me) it's like the OP said, it's almost like I forget English...and it's probably particularly annoying to my ENTP bf - so props to him for putting up with me for 15 years haha I do a lot of "Ugh why didn't I say that, or Ugh why did I say it that way" I also have Social Anxiety Disorder- so not sure if it's a personality type thing, or a anxious/nervous thing tbh probably both lol
1	I used to talk pretty well, just not about my feelings. Now I started stuttering and messing up words, and I swear I've never been happier/calmer. I honestly can't figure it out. \n\nI always hated talking on the phone, though.
1	Introverts are often like that. It's due to feeling before expressing, which makes introverts take longer to explain something or having to plan out what they're gonna say
1	same HAHA especially when I'm at the center of attention. like everyone is listening to me and i get SO nervous and tongue-tied all of a sudden i can't even help it.
1	Most of the time, yes. \nThe only way I can really know what I really think or feel is talking about it. It doesn't matter if its speech, text or just a dialogue in my head, I need to rant about it for a good time, lay all my thoughts down in a table and link them, like a jigsaw puzzle.
4	needed to get this off my chest	Stupid stories that have no meaning filled with nonsense and randomness are sometimes the only things I think about.\nSometimes I just want to scream at an oyster for being sea food. \nTurtle is a weird sounding word. Tortelduif is strange as well.\nI’m feeling annoyed at the moment and I want to punch a baby, I don’t even dislike babies. It just shows the level of annoyance.\nI have to stay calm and talk to people about something but I feel that those people are being selfish about and that they are handling the situation incorrectly. \nIf I could have a super power I would want to either be able to teleport or to speak any language.\nSorry I'm feeling like things are too much and needed to vent some nonsense.\n\non a side note. Any of you ever write random stories about how you feel?
3	> Any of you ever write random stories about how you feel?\n\nI don't but I'd like to. \n\nToday I've felt like 'vomiting out laughter' a lot. I sometimes have uncontrollable laughter fits that I try to repress in public and sometimes they leak out. I feel like, at any point, my laughter will bottle up and it will be impossible to repress it and it will come out all at once, just like vomit. This has happened to me in public before, actually. I saw a certain fictional character's name on a device outside a store and I started laughing for 10 minutes straight. (It was on a class trip.) I think everyone would question if I'm okay if I were to suddenly run into a toilet booth and start laughing as hard as I can holding my stomach as I let it all out into the toilet. \n\nIt sometimes gets triggered very easily, I can think of dancing robots and I start giggling like a maniac.
2	anyone want to be pM pals	I kind of want to talk to a random stranger about my life\n\nas far as anonymity, we can both make throwaways haha.
4	Too much of a committment without knowing anything about you first
1	Sure we could chat. I'm not looking for a date or anything. :)
1	some chopped and screwed music	
4	I wish this subreddit was a person	It's always so nice and kind\n\nI would go out with this subreddit tbh
5	*winks nicely and kindly*
1	I'm single lol
7	how do you get to know someone	so this might seem like a stupid question.\n\nI have 1 close friend right now, my sister. But there is somebody else who I have a very good gut feeling about trust-wise . I think he is an INFP, and he seems very mature. I got to know him a few years ago at a summer internship program and I know he has a pretty good character (I am pretty good at vetting people btw in an Enneagram 8ish way, and almost everyone fails the tests). and We both have had similar psychological experiences, it seems (lack of trust, depression, avoidant personalities). We knew right away about each other that we were kind of on the same wavelength (in a non sexual way). Him and my sister are the only people I have ever had this feeling with, the kind of person I never get into a flight with. (Yes you might be thinking I am overreading into this but no, I am not, I have good evidence to back this up.)\n\nHe is also very supportive in general.\n\nHow do you get to know someone? Although I am bi it is perfectly non sexual, and we prefer to communicate through text (less personal than phone calls).
1	Diffusion. 
10	So Im new here...	And This is basically just going to be a ramble to see if anything hits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'll get the lay of the land, seeing as it doesn't seem that active and why not? You don't know me. At worst I'll get into another accidental Reddit argument. (How that even happened idk but it seemed rude to stop?)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't know too much about (MBTI) except I type into ISFP every few years and I'd guess my boyfriend is a INTJ. Which is strange because to me everyone that can be around new people must be an extrovert. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI missed the "Find a Friend Thread" over a wholesome memes and you guys seem to be at a standstill. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo here's the deal, Im [insert age and gender here]. I think anything can be funny until it's serious. I don't believe in fighting over politics or religion but I would love to talk about world mythologies! Or video games. (Or both at the same time!). I used to be a web developer but doing it as a job took all enjoyment out of it (also my bf is a big shot and who wants to be compared to that?). I recently took up jewelry making in my free time. I like a variety of music. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy boyfriend and I do this cheesy thing where we take a popular song and one up each other in add dirty limericks. I'm biased-ly better.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReally I don't care what we talk about here. *(Honestly you're all asleep but it feels nice to type all this down. I can be the person I want to be as long as I have the opportunity to edit my words.)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo talk, don't talk. Maybe we can communicate in barks? Im more of a cat person, but I can make it work. There's got to be a primer for that somewhere. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk, ending this now its getting quite silly.
4	Haha, welcome. I don't know what it is about reddit that makes us so uninterested in posting in here. I think we could be more active though. (not using should because that is an annoying word) I've gotten a couple ideas but just haven't gotten around in posting them lol. (I assure you though the ISFP Facebook group is WAY more active.) 
2	Welcome :)
1	Isfp verbal vomit :)\n\nI love it. 
1	Ruff! Ruff!
1	I'm ISFP(obviously I guess?) and my ex was an INTJ as well. I would love to hear your thoughts on the compatibility there, or really just any comments you have about your relationship. I could definitely go into mine and my ex's relationship, I probably just need some questions to go off of to get into it. 
1	I'm not entirely sure how to connect with other people, but hi.\n\nI think we would get along as I'm also a cat person and also have both an age and a gender.
1	yo\n\ni like INTJs, at least more than ISTJs who say way too many details, Si is very annoying haha
5	Did you ever go through a phase?	Emo phase, scene phase, neckbeard, random phase, etc? I bet most of us have had some sort of "phase" to express ourselves when we were younger. Gotta let out that Fi somewhere, am I right? Share some of your embarrassing tales. 
3	**1. Emo**\n\n\nSo I was emo because even though I thought goth fashion looked cooler I could never have done that myself. And really, all I did was wear a lot of black clothes. Wait, let me rephrase that. I wore a lot of black clothes and hoodies... while living in California. Lol what a little twerp. Ain't nobody telling me what colors to like or not like. Speaking of which, I had my room painted red with black sponge patterns. Quite striking visually, but horrible for a bedroom. But I suppose a teenager can't keep a lavender and pink room forever.\n\n\nAlso I think this loner emo mentality might have done severe damage to my past friend status and current inability to make friends (or even talk to people how do i even?).\n\n\n**2. Scene and Goth**\n\n\nWhat I really wanted to dress as but was too self conscious to ever try.\n\n\n**3. Anime Club**\n\n\nGrew up watching DBZ and Inuyasha. Would admit to no one I watched DBZ cus it was a *boy's* thing to watch. Watched Naruto appear on Toonami and it was gg (game over, nice match). It helped that there was an anime club at school where I could hang out with other people.\n\n\nOf course all of that is over and I am a totally balanced adult but maybe stay out of my Netflix history you can't prove nothing.
1	Anime phase was probably one of my biggest phases. Now I'm not as big of an anime nerd, but I still listen to a lot of music from japanese artists etc. that may make an impression that I'm an anime nerd. I'm still caught up in Touhou music. 
1	I absolutely go through phases. I've got an addictive/obsessive personality, so when I get into something I often go all out!
5	My friend's doing a survey on mBTI in the workplace and needs more iSFPs, any help is appreciated!	
1	As an ISFP, office place behavior definitely isn't my forte. I think most would agree. I'd tell your boss that it's far too specific for an ISFP to give relatable answers. Two of the main strengths that we have in the workplace is that we don't become stressed easily and that we are natural improvisers
13	why is this sub so chill?	this sub is where i come when i want to chill on reddit.\n\non all the other subs there are little moderators poking their eyes around making sure everyone is following the rules and shit\n\nidk if this sub even has mods though. it is just very chill\n\nthis reminds me of the buddhist subreddit tbh
14	ISFPs are super chill yo!
10	looks like there are two mods, dunno how much they do, we aren't a rowdy bunch.
8	We aren't that talkative :P
3	It's so chill because we are all here keeping the peace. If only the world was the same!
2	There are less than 1% of INFJs in the world but /r/INFJ is at least 10 times more active than this sub.
5	anyone excited for new kendrick tonight?	
2	Super hyped. although we have to wait another week lol
1	actually my friend is making a business deal out of it, he's promoting some stuff, hoping to catch some of the wave\n\npersonally idgaf about kendrick
1	yas
2	What makes u feel valued chime in	so i have been thinking about this shit\n\ni have realized that makes me feel valued is contributing something important\n\nand snuggling\n\nthis subreddit is dead, thought someone might find this funny
7	everyone here likes to reply to posts- in their head.\n\ni second the snuggling part haha 
3	i live with my gf's family, i feel valued when my gf's mom asks me to help her use the printer haha
3	When people actually want to spend time with me. Most of the time it just feels like people talk to me out of politeness.
2	I feel valued when people take the time to listen to my opinions and give feedback. Or that I'm not the only one who thinks this way. r/doesanybodyelse was practically made for me.
1	People giving a real shit about me. Also, People actually talking to me. Not just bs'ing me.
4	Where are you from?	What's your favorite tv show? I like Forensic Files and Father Brown. What did you think about The Life of Pi? The Matrix is my favorite movie. I'm not sure what my fave song is anymore. Any suggestions? Any Canadian IFSP's? Ps. I forgot books 📚😞 believe it or not, A Tale of Two Cities and the Outsiders. I read them both numerous times. It's interesting because they are similar in a way but totally different.
2	10 000 feet by wolfmother, my favorite series is Community (first 4 seasons), to many movies (matrix is one of them), didnt really think much about it (was entertaining but didnt jump at me so i didnt think about it to much). \n\nOh and i am South African. 
2	repping naptown to the death of me\n\ncastle, discontinued now, fuck my life tbh\n\nabove average but not too good, not memorable\n\nfave movies: scream / alien, i am a horror guy\n\nfavorite artist: drake
2	I'm Canadian\n\nMy favourite show right now is Vikings\n\nI've never heard of The Life of Pi
2	[deleted]
2	Hello, I'm from the UK.\nI have not seen the Life of Pi.\nFavourite movie would be Fantastic Mr Fox because the soundtrack is awesome, I'm a sucker for stopmotion animation and especially for Wes Anderson because #aesthetics.\nMy favourite singer is Ben Howard, favourite band would be Arctic Monkeys or Kasabian. It changes.\nFavourite song at the moment is probably Dangerous by the xx, though Drive by Oh Wonder was my most played song of 2016.
2	West Coast-ian\nLoved Frasier and Breaking Bad\nFuture house and other chill EDM is my jam\n\nAs an Indian, I liked Life of Pi! Great film :D
2	I grew up between Florida and Germany. My favorite show right now is Orphan Black, but like many others. I loved the movie Life of Pi! I never read the book though. I would suggest the movie Hero (jet li) it's my favorite :) And Amelie is a great movie too. Currently, I'm obsessed with the songs Where's my Love by SYML and Your Body by Cat Dealers, Love by Lana Del Rey and Bad Karma by Axel Thesleff. I'm not Canadian, but I would love to visit again someday since I've only been to Niagra Falls when I was a kid.
6	thought i was a istp, not anymore!	The ui of this subreddit is reassuring and welcoming.\n\nI've made the right choice.\n\nSo my wonderful people what triggered your thoughts today?\n\nToday I crammed my intellectual ability in to a essay last minute and I still got a great response from my professor! 
2	also just realized the caps are a lie...
1	So you're an isfp? \n\nWhat made you think you were an ISTP? \n\nI, sometimes, too wonder if I really am an ISTP. How did you come to the conclusion that you're an ISFP? 
1	First up before I go on a bit of a rant, nice work on the essay. Winging it and pulling it off is always a good feeling. Anyone can a HD. But only a hero can get it by doing the entire thing 5 minutes before class.\n\nAnyway, because its related and don't really wanna make a post about it I'll just do it here. I toe the line between ISTP and ISFP. And even a bit between them and the INTP/INFP. Basically, both just from my experience with myself and from the test results I'm about 50/50 between feeling and thinking and only slightly skewed towards sensing over intuition.\n\nAnd not in a good way. I'm the ISFP without creativity, or the ISTP without all the good parts from thinking (planning mainly). A bit of an idealist while recognizing that my ideals aren't reality and never will be. \n\nAnybody else feel like this? I get the feeling I'm taking these personality things a bit too much like they are set in stone and everyone fits one, but still. It'd be nice to know there are other people as lost as me.
1	Come back Darkmatter... come back to the daaaaak siiiide.
5	Buddhism	are you guys buddhist? I deconverted from christianity about a year ago as it seemed increasingly unrealistic and illogical, and I have been reading up on buddhism. it makes a lot of sense IMO.
6	There are probably better religions out there than Christianity, but Christianity is not suppose to ne a religion. To be Christian is to have a relashionship with God our father that fosters intimacy, and that is all He wants. \n\nIm not trying to preach to you just sharing what I experience about my faith. 
2	I was raised Catholic and have gone back and forth in my beliefs. I enjoy the spiritual peace, but dislike all the rules/structure and like you I find some of it illogical. Who knows what the true answer is, just be kind to one another regardless of personal beliefs. 
2	I've gotten a lot of useful insights from Zen Buddhism and Taoism. You should check out Alan Watts and Adyashanti, it's pretty good.
2	I'm a Christan and have grown a lot deeper in my faith after finding churches, books, articles, debates, videos, etc. That have a firm foundation on history, culture, context, logic, and application. A lot of churches or "famous" church leaders water down their message or completely take things out of context and the effects of that take a toll on how others perceive us. 
2	I am Christian but I think there are many Buddhist teachings that are useful as well. I also feel that Christianity and Buddhism are similar in some ways although different in others. I do look to Buddhism for insight on living a happy and simple life. 
1	Whenever I don't understand anything, I ask God, then the answer comes to me in one form or another. Sometimes, I "just suddenly get it" shortly after. If we knew everything, then what would we need God for? If you are having trouble with faith then you ask God to help you have more faith, if we could be a Christian without God that wouldn't make sense. If you are struggling it's because you are trying to do it on your own. God won't help you unless you ask for it and thank him in advance.
1	I was raised Buddhist but I think I lean more atheist. Growing up my parents were very against anything that wasn't buddhism but didn't strictly enforce it on me either. 
11	ISFPs and Depression?	Do you guys struggle with depression? I've been dealing with it for a few years and was just curious if it's common for our type. If so, what are your signs and thought patterns while in a depressed mood? For me it's not wanting to get out of bed in the morning, thinking I'm "different" or not wanted, and just trying to stay in my comfort zone. I can lead a normal life and no one would know but it does take a lot of self talk to get me out there and to dismiss my negative thoughts. I'm interested to hear what you guys think!\n
3	While I have never had full blown depression, I have figured out ways to make myself feel better when I am feeling down. Usually, I try to just forget about whatever is bothering me by planning out a full day where all I do is stuff relating to my hobbies and just keeping busy. If for some reason I can't do my hobbies that day, I research random ones to start or go out and do. Personally, I find that when I have a lot of free time and am not busy doing stuff during the day I get sad pretty easily. \n\nAlso look up stuff to do with positive psychology and the science of happiness. Maybe some of the things to do with that will help
3	The belief that life wasn't only going to hand me lemons. I knew recovery was going to be a long process, because my depression had lasted years. Getting better was hard, but I had a tiny bit of faith in the future and there was something better out there for me. Idk if that helps. 
3	Just saw this so thought I'd respond. I actually had slipped into a hole of depression recently. Depression for me, similar to you OP, is not getting out of bed, feeling eternally bored and unsettled, and not eating. It's also being really negative and critical of everyone and everything.\n I also get into a couple of cycles. One is telling myself I'm a piece of shit for staying in bed all day instead of being productive, so I feel worthless and undeserving of friends or happiness, so I stay in bed all day. Another is that I keep putting things off. Like, oh I don't need to go to this class, I'll just watch one more YouTube video and then I'll get up and go to the next class. But then that time comes around and I'll convince myself that I don't need to go to that class either and that I'll just aim for the next one. Then I've skipped 3 of the 4 classes I had that day and I don't see the point in going at all. \n\nDepression is super hard, man. \nI'll tell you what though, actually making myself smile and do little jobs around the apartment really does help. At least for me. Even if it's just taking the laundry out of the machine and setting it on the end of my bed. Little accomplishments help. \nHope things get better for ya. 
2	I think depression may be the opposite of expression. Like another person said creating things might help. For me, I have a lot of unfinished projects so I never get the satisfaction of completion. Also, for me I spend too much time in my head so I started a journal.
2	I do sometimes. It's more loneliness than serious depression. I wish I was in a relationship but then I remember how nice it is to be single.
1	Are there things that other people do that you find helpful? 
3	Did you ever mistype as an Intuitive?	How many of you mistyped as Intuitives ?\nWhat type did you mistype as?\nWhat made you realise you were an ISFP?
1	yes\n\nall of the rational types\n\nrealizing i am isfp
1	I have mistyped as EVERY iNtuitive there is. 
1	Everytime I've taken an mbti test I flip between INFP and ISFP.  I've read some additional material and related to both so idk. 
1	Yeah I thought I was an INFP for a long time. 
1	Well, I still don't know if my functions are Ne-Si or Se-Ni. I often have doubts about it. It might be because of my depression and anxiety problems that I can't seem to find it.\n\nIt's not that I think either type is "better" but I really can't tell what functions I use other than Fi-Te. Even if I found which I was, I'm a crappy version of either ISFP or INFP.\n\nI haven't read any of the books (I don't want to spend money on MBTI stuff) but I read a few websites, like mbti-notes, and watched a lot youtube videos and honestly nothing helped me understand which combination fits better. I can relate to Se-Ni and Ne-Si. I don't know how to see which ones I use more or prefer. I read pretty much everything on mbti-notes (and that is very dense material).
1	I've typed as an INFP about as often as ISFP. The funny thing is when I type as ISFP, it usually says I'm like 90% sensing. So it's either wording biases in some tests or my mood at the moment.\n\nResearching functions and how they influence my internal motivation and behavior, I'm absolutely 100% positive I'm ISFP.
5	Tell me your goals	If you have any right now?
9	Does managing to get by somehow and having fun while doing so count?
5	Get my TEFL certification and teach English overseas :) 
3	Keep working out, maybe do a pull up one day (I'm a girl with wimpy arms), and maybe start studying again so I can get a better job... It's hard though :P  I'm pretty happy where I am, just enjoying day by day
3	right now, make a good album. it is on the way, maybe within a month
3	Make at least one friend by summer, so I will be able to hang out with someone during the decreasing amount of free time I will have off of school
2	No clear goals, I guess living semi-comfortably while not having to worry about everything all the time.
2	Stereotypical ISFP goal (lol), but to become a graphic designer and animator, and create work that others can relate to that makes the world a collectively happier place! 
1	Right now: building good habits. \nShort term: Buy a van and start traveling Canada and the US.\nLong term: write an album. 
1	Currently mine's to move to the capital city, Helsinki, to study Italian and Japanese in the summer university. Afterwards maybe aim for an acting career with a side study of game design.
5	Overall, are you happy with your life?	Just checking in :)
8	Eh
2	I'd say 60% (just finished like three hours of math), although that can change from day to day. In the future (like in the next year) I could see it going to like 85%,\n\n\nIdk really know tho, i even debated the numerical value of those numbers\n\n\n*Honestly, the more I think about it, the more I think I'm not that happy with my life, maybe 55%... Maybe I should stop thinking...
2	I think overall things are looking up, but ya know, sometimes life has a way of making you question everything, so there's that.
2	Mostly, but my developing Ni has for the last two years or so started taking a toll on me. I get depressed and very panicky thinking about how fast my life is going by and I can't do much about it, people my age are finishing school or doing more with their lives than me, we're all gonna die someday and terrifyingly might be forgotten, etc. Like, keeps me up at night worrying and crying. \n\nHopefully this is just a Fi-Ni loop and I'll get over it. For the most part though, I am satisfied. I can't change much so there's no logical reason to complain. I have little things to look forward to and my faith, which keep me sane.
1	absolutely\n\ni am on track with everything and likely going to have a fun job over the summer so yea
1	Yeah! Got an ok desk job where I have a lot of free time to browse the internet, good friends, enough money to do what I want, so there's not much more I could want.
1	It's okay . I see a lot I can improve though.
3	What do you guys think an isfp ceo would look like	
13	Whatever a startup CEO looks like before they're bought out and taken over by ENTJ execs.
2	Yes it's technically for infps but i thought you guys could relate to this	
11	Why is this subreddit dead	can we get some new quality posts?
22	Isfps naturally aren't conversation starters. Nothing wrong with that, but it definitely doesn't make an active sub. We should have a merger 
10	I keep thinking that I need to start a thread, but I never know what to talk about so it never happens. 
10	Shout out to /u/RapProducer being 50% of the sub
5	[deleted]
3	Yo, can we get some flairs too?
1	[deleted]
1	Cuz we're introverted maybe. :)
9	[Mod Post] Are you a certified iSFP? If so, you may be eligible for the ENTJ Conversion Treatment Therapy Plan!	
12	how do you act when You Like someone, and what are your biggest fears when entering/In a relationship?	Calling all ISFPs from their hiding holes and asking out of curiosity! I just want to know if the way other ISFPs react in emotionally-charged situations like having a crush/being in a relationship are similar to the way I currently feel. I also really enjoy hearing about others' experiences in general!\n\n\nI've noticed that each time I begin to develop feelings for someone, I'll at first talk to them openly and comfortably, but the more my feelings for the person intensify, the more I avoid them/ghost them and try to pretend they don't exist, or that they never heard I liked them in the first place. My biggest fears, although somewhat typical, have always been that the person would consider me odd, leave me because of issues with my family (as I've had very terrifying childhood experiences), or think I wasn't good enough for them.\n\nWhat sorts of experiences do you all have to share? How do you initially speak in front of those you like? (Quickly, calmly, etc.) 
5	I don't have a whole lot of worry because there are a lot of potential ppl\n\nAs long as I can vibe w someone they are a good fit imo
2	I might act chill with them if my feelings are subconscious, but once I start to fully realize I like them I act disinterested for some reason. I'm working on being more assertive since I had skinny love with this one guy. He got bored with me and eventually started flirting with one of my friends :( 
2	I'm a pretty mellow person on the regs. So as long as you vibe with me, or intrigue me long enough I'll be interested. When I realize I like a person, I tend to want to know more. I'd slide in the DMs and whatnot.\nWhen I draw something for them? Thats when it's donezo, I really like you.
2	When I have a crush on someone, when I admire them or think they are very beautiful, I also tend to get away from them, even physically, because people might notice it and I'll be vulnerable, and they might like me back and then I'll be vulnerable again, and will probably get hurt.\n\nI have the tendency to take care of everyone around me and put myself in a lower priority, so I need to be careful with that. I've dated a guy for 5 years (I'm a girl) and it ended terribly, he cheated on me and I still felt like I loved him. So I definitely don't want to go back to feeling dependent on someone else. I've been single for 3 years and am enjoying it, I still have meaningful relationships but haven't "found" someone I'd want to spend my life and effort around that one person
2	When I have a crush I keep it to myself, be myself by wanting to just absorb someone by jyst bei g there, so people tend to find me to be a good listener and are comfortable opening up to me. Then I think about what they tell me and interpret if they might feel the same. Then its general getting to know that person more by sharing a bit of me or being charming etc, but i tend to think a lot more than what I show and then it will grow and I will suddenly just ramp up the relationship, usually physically and at that point i am in. And then im very in. Way in. All in. So I tend to get hurt becuase the other person moves on or thinks diffrently. Anyway thats the past, im currently with someone that has the same voals and feel and do relationships very similar to me so its good. 
2	ah so late to the game but i have to say i feel the same way as you do - i can talk to them openly and comfortably initially but when i get in my own head about my feelings i tend to avoid them. even the occasions i try to reach out to them i think it's hard to tell that i'm interested because i try to make it casual (like oh hey you're here too let's grab dinner). it's hard for me to sustain eye contact when i like them, which sucks because eye contact is one good way of conveying interest.\n\nso anyway all of this has led me to having little success. my current crush seems like he's interested in a friend of mine instead, and it sucks so much. he pulled that same "oh hey you guys are here" thing when i was on the way home with said friend, because he's fairly unacquainted with her and probably would find it awkward to strike up conversation with her in my absence.\n\nsorry for the digression - but i guess that is a fear of mine in this respect - having the person you like be interested in someone else, especially when that person is a close friend. :(
1	Just like you, I usually play it cool all the way until I start having feelings for the person. Then all my insecurities slip through and I try to avoid them as much as possible for fear of rejection. Fun being an ISFP :D
1	Once I develop a crush, it drives me crazy. I basically read into things so much before I can't stand it and basically ask them out indirectly. Then I get rejected and I can focus on getting over them instead of wondering if they like me or not.
9	Psychedelics as a tool for introspection	Let me first start off by saying I do not advocate the use of psychedelics etc.\n\nI recently watched a TV program where they discussed the benefits of psychedelics, and the TV host himself even went to Amsterdam himself to try it. I've heard stories about how LSD has cured chronic depression and anxiety, and how it has made people turn around their lives for the better after trying it. It's also non-toxic and has been described as an anti-addictive drug (!) because of its potential to treat alcoholism and other addictions. Here in Norway we also have a political organization, [EmmaSofia](http://www.emmasofia.org/), working to legalize MDMA and psilocybin.\n\nI wondered if anyone in here have any thoughts on the subject? Have you tried psychedelics and want to share your experience?
8	I'll reply since nobody else has. I'm only a college student, but I've tripped on LSD 4 times. I would certainly recommend it, but only to people who have researched the chemical thoroughly. Read up on other people's experiences with the chemical (erowid and /r/drugs are generally good resources). \n\nMy experiences have been varied. The first 3 experiences were EXTREMELY eye-opening. I believe that each experience is unique, but LSD generally will give you a different lense to view the world with. You will do silly things, like look at trees for an hour or laugh uncontrollably for no reason. Your emotions will be intensified, which is why setting can be so important. A trip in the cold  night alone can make for a dreadfully scary experience, but tripping in what you perceive to be a "safe place" has the potential to be a terrific time.\n\nI will emphasize again: do your research. Make sure you are actually taking LSD, and not an alternative substance, such as 25i.\n\nI'm off to class, but let me know if you have anymore questions.
4	I haven't done any drugs yet, but I'm interested in psychedelics as an experience. I might try it once just to see what it feels like. 
1	I've heard pure MDMA can be very therapeutical. A friend of mine (seriously) took it and was able to talk about a past experience of abuse, which was a trauma he repressed because if he even thought about it, a lot of terrible feelings would come with it. But as he was in a blissful high, the memory and the talk didn't make him feel bad, so he was able to get it out, and now he is able to talk about it, no problem.\n\nEither way, I recommend a safe environment and being close to at least one person you trust. I've taken low doses of LSD in various scenarios, it makes you see things (colors, perspective) in a different way, more intense maybe, and it also made me feel connected to the general happy vibe in the place I was. I also felt more inclined to do things I usually wouldn't, specially related to touch, like go into a cold pool at midnight, make out with my best friend hahaha. Just make sure you're not stressed or worried about anything, or it could turn into a bad trip
5	Should I pursue a career in the science of videogame art and design?	Hello. I know this is not the most appropriate sub to post something like this but as a fellow isfp (or at least I believe I am) I have gotten tired of studying economics which I took just to take a career, I know, big mistake.\n\nNow though, I've taken some time off from university to find out what do I truly want to do throughout my life and since I've played videogames, written and read stuff as early as I could remember I thought that the department mentioned in the title could just be the thing I've been looking for. Giving me a chance of storyboarding my long time inspired ideas by videogames, draw (which I'm not particularly good at at all but willing to get good at) and make games! Overall just express myself and make a job out of those ideas!\n\nWhat has me worried about this though is programming. A friend of mine took his fair share of it and he didn't seem to enjoy it all that much.  He has taken some time to explain to me what's that All about and I can't help but be rather intimidated by it. Math and numbers overall have never been my strong suit and I'm genuinely worried that it might make me regret this choice.\n\nSome suggest trying a career that has to do more with literature and while I'm not against it I would be lying if I didn't say that I find it a bit tedious at times.  \n\nI do have a "backup choice" if anything and that would be learning a 3rd language (currently know 2) and give translation a shot, videogame translation if given the chance would be great. The languages I'm interested in are Japanese or Chinese maybe both if possible. While it isn't as much of an expressive profession as I would like I find it genuinely fun to learn a language since you are learning so much more than just the language. Culture, ideals and many other things fall there as well.\n\n However in my current nearby area there are no bachelors provided by any university that involve any of the previously mentioned languages, the closest thing are electives so not much hope there...\n\nWhat do you guys suggest/think about this situation?\n\nAny sort of input helps and thanks in advance!\n\n\n\n
2	I have always loved programming, as it to me seems to be the perfects blend between logic and creativity. Within programming there are a lots of ways to solve the same problem, and it can require some really out of the box thinking to find the most efficient solution. I think learning a programming language in a lot of ways is the same as learning another language. Just like you create sentences according to grammatical rules in say Japanese, you create statements in programming according to rules of the programming language. Each line of code in programming basically says "create textbox here", "add this number to that number 60 times" etc.\n\nJust check up a tutorial on C# (which I prefer) or Python (commonly learned to beginners) or something. It doesn't take long to learn the basics and get the feel for it.
2	If you really want to do something, if you are willing to give up anything for it, you will succeed 1 way or another.
2	I'm an ISFP who works in games but in the art side of things.  I think if you're really worried if programming isn't your thing, you might as well see how far you can get into programming a small, *small* game.  If you get no joy from that then, yeah programming is probably not for you.  That said, you don't really need to do programming to get into the industry.  There's a lot of different kinds of fields involved.  Heck, I know someone who is an accountant for a game company haha.  Also don't go to school for game design, that's a crock of shit.\n\nYou could try to self study language if you're really passionate about it.  A degree would be nice but there are internationally recognized language tests you can take.  It's the JLPT for Japanese, not sure what the Chinese equivalent is.\n
2	This is honestly a great question, since there's very little information out there on earning a spot in the video game industry. I'm studying to be a Graphic Designer, so maybe I can help you a tiny bit! :0\nVideo game designers and artists are, as the name obviously implies, artists in their own right. If you are physically/financially able, I would highly recommend moving to an area that would allow you to attend a university that gives you the sort of hands-on training and educational experience necessary from developers/designers who were successful in their fields. Because this field is fiercely competitive (and AWESOME!!), the educational facet of it is certainly helpful when trying to find a career in the video game industry.\n\n\nHowever, what I have frequently heard from many people in the same shoes you're in is that the most important thing to have is a portfolio! :) Any person can call themselves a video game designer or artist and have the educational experience to boot, but on any resume, employers in the industry would actually prefer to see individuals who have forged their own success over having attended a school specifically for the trade. \nWhat this means is that employers would rather hire an individual who, for example, started their own independent project and was able to make it a success, rather than a person who just has nice-looking credentials/schooling but has only worked on many smaller projects from a variety of places without completing a project. Ask any professor/professional you become acquainted with during your time at school to help you build up a portfolio. You MUST, I repeat, MUST BUILD a portfolio. Get a group of friends together/find and network with people who enjoy the same field you do and make some projects--the more you make, the more astute you'll be when you're asked to demonstrate these sorts of skills later. Look at games that inspire you and artists/designers that worked on said games and read up on how they got their start in the industry. Practice drawing from life and sketching any ideas you may have in your head every chance you get. Find out what you're best at (level design, character design, game mechanics, etc.) and perfect your skills; it's good to be informed on a variety of things, too, but it's preferred that you demonstrate proficiency in one area of video game design and art. \n\nTake this part with a grain of salt, since I'm speaking from a graphic designing perspective and am not exactly sure if this applies to video game design as well: When you start putting work in your portfolio, do NOT make it so that only your oldest/worst work is first and your newest/best work is last. Leave that for a few specific pages in so that employers/internship supervisors can see your growth as an artist/designer over time, and a few pages dedicated to drawing studies/sketches/etc., but a majority of your portfolio should be a mix of your older and newer work to give it a sense of balance and create a greater aesthetic appeal.\n\n\nOn a side note, if you do end up taking a class that requires you to learn about programming, why not try 3D/character modeling/map building and the like instead? My university offers this sort of thing for students in the Science/Engineering building. Many community colleges offer foreign language courses that you can take if you do prefer becoming a translator. Perhaps try searching for one that offers Chinese or Japanese? Out of curiosity, what's the other language you currently speak? This can give you quite an edge when applying for jobs in the field in the future! Language is a powerful tool to have under your belt.\n\n\nI wish you luck, fellow artist friend! c: Please do update us and let us know how your situation is in the future. Christ, I AM SO SORRY FOR THE NOVEL OF A COMMENT.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** The school you attend isn't always important, what's important is your dedication to your passion! Go to a university specifically for these skills if you can, but if not, work on projects with your friends in the free time/try to make a name for yourself in the industry, practice, practice, practice, ask mentors for guidance and assistance, learn as much as you can about the field/industry, and most importantly, BUILD A PORTFOLIO, MAN! \n
1	The way I see it- if it's something you REALLY want to do, then go all out and do whatever you need to get the job. If you do end up failing after giving an honest try, you'll have at least, learned some good lessons about life through it and you'll be able to say you gave it your all. There are a lot of people in the world who never try and just accept an easier way, youll be of the few who tried to make the most out of your one life, 
12	anyone want to chill in this thread	share thoughts
12	Sure!\n\n*chills*
9	My thought is that I don't want to share my thoughts
3	I'm a 22 yeah old male in college with shoulder length hair and I'm thinking about cutting most of the side off but having a really long tip that parts to one side but I'm scared to do it because if I don't like it then it will take about a year to get back to where I am now. Plus I have this mental thing that it's quitting to cut my hair short now that I've finally grown it long and that that makes me a bad person. But I also don't like how it looks now so I'm in a mental tug of war with it and it's actually making me anxious because I feel stuck

2	hi
2	Well, I studied photography and started working as a freelancer in a lot of small paying jobs while still in uni. The design part, I picked up while working. \nWhat are you studying in uni?
1	Nah
10	why does it seem very easy to come up with creative things	I am a musician and i have noticed that a lot of people approach music like an Si dom would: very ritualistically, seeking advice from "the experts", etc. \n\nFor me it is a lot of work to copy someone elses' style and I don't see the point of it. It is hard to imagine how people aren't creative and still want to be musicians, since music is about creativity and emotion. It seems easier to be creative in the first place, all you have to do is move random shit together until it seems cool
2	Our main Fi function allows us to feel deeply in all aspects of life, which in this case is music. However the creation part that comes easily to us in mainly aided by our Ni. I'm a visual artist and I get these random spikes of creativity from the most random things in life. I like to "copy" a style, which i would refer to as practise more than copying, for the sole purpose of understanding it and learn the logic behind it. I've recently started learning the piano and after practising some music that inspire me I find myself drifting off in my own tunes. 
1	Conversion plan 😏 It could indeed work wonders. I wouldn't trade being ISFP though. 
4	what each guardian / rational type would do after they get rejected, + relevant album i made	Here is a bit of background, hopefully you think it is a funny story.\n\nThis girl was leading me on so I asked her out and got rejected, and I realized the other day she was just using me for something.\n\ninstead of getting over it like a normal person and processing my emotions healthily by say, talking to a human, playing video games, eating 1000 gallons of ice cream (I think this is what an xNFP would do?) I decided to make an album, and music videos to it to top it off.\n\nJust for fun here is what I think each type would do in this situation (if acting unhealthily- if they are acting healthily, the action will be the same regardless.)\n\n**Guardians**\n\nISTJ- After their Te has failed to get them a date after taking the necessary steps they will retreat into Si / Fi, projecting negative emotional intent onto people- my mom is stuck in a vicious Si / Fi loop, it's not good\n\nISFJ- Si / Ti loop- they may rethink why they got rejected over and over again.\n\nESTJ- Te / Ne- they may dream up tons of grandiose plans and try to enact them.\n\nESFJ- Fe / Ne- they may seek more and more admiration from others\n\n**Rationals**\n\nI understand rationals much better than guardians so this is probably a lot more accurate than the last section.\n\nINTP- Ti / Si- they will remember every date they went on and what went wrong, and conclude there is no logical reason for social interaction, basically becoming a schizoid\n\nINTJ- Ni / Fi - they will rely upon internal validation such as their feelings in a given situation to reject anyone who might try to reject them next time\n\nENTP- Like the ESFJ stated earlier\n\nENTJ- Te/Se- they will become fixated on making their environment perfect and may resemble enneagram 8s\n\nIdealists / Artisans I don't understand well enough to comment on.\n\nhere is what 1 ISFP did, I made this (as well as rambling endlessly on the internet for days at a time)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tosx6qZHoU8\n\nHere it is on soundcloud if you would prefer to listen there\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/2therapper/sets/aishnitoelspr-1
2	No ISTP? 
1	will reply later
5	Would a world be a better place if everyone would be like You?	Like in title: Would a world be a better place if everyone would be like You?
13	No way. So many projects would get started, yet nothing would be completed 
9	Of course not. The world is better off with a wide variety of different kinds of people. 
1	Nah. I give up too easy. 
1	nah
1	No Im very selfish. The world needs more Fe more universal love for humanity.
8	is this what a jaded isfp would look like	I have a theory that I am a jaded ISFP although a lot of people have mistyped me as an ISTP / xNTJ because I come off as cold to almost everyone (common for ISTPs IME) and xxTJ because I have a very simplistic (though rigid and crucial) moral code and have developed good Te after many years spent in stress relying upon the grip function.\n\nFirst of all Fi is definitely my dominant function. Based on my personal experience I have a set of values (although it is very simplistic, meaning most situations are amoral) and Se is quite likely my secondary function (making music / art is my main hobby). Ni for third (I can usually predict how things will go and I am good at finding the underlying truth) and Te for fourth (my Te > Ti) I can see. There are many decisions I make with Fi which Se/Ni/Te would scoff at.\n\nMost of the ISFP descriptions focus on how ISFPs are concerned about preserving harmony, keeping others happy, charity, fulfilling their personal values in their environment, etc (basically an E9). However my personal moral set is very individualistic, more like libertarianism. Although I am a fairly nice person in general I don't go out of my way to preserve harmony / make others happy / etc. and because my personal experiences are more negative my Fi has made me very jaded: I am very cynical about other people and there is no one I fully trust. This is because my personal experiences have told my Fi that no one can be trusted (like an unhealthy E8). This is in contrast with most ISFP descriptions which are very idealistic, about over-trusting friends / significant others / etc.\n\nFurthermore, I take more pleasure in seeing the (very) few people I dislike / hate suffering hardship than I do in seeing someone I consider ethical succeed. I also have a vague sense of dysphoria all the time, I never feel really happy, though sometimes I feel stimulated and confuse that for joy. I also was rather depressed for the majority of my life up to present in retrospect which led me to completely pack away my emotions, to the point that people call me robotic and emotionless. They still do now, even as emotions about normal things like working on a homework assignment overwhelm me, it's just that my emotions are hidden now.\n\nI feel like an unhealthy 8 in a sea of Nines, lol.\n\nBTW I think my tritype is 348 sp/sx. Very heavy on the sp, light on the sx.\n\nEDIT: also I don't relate to many of the ISFP weaknesses such as low self esteem, unable to complete tasks when in stress, etc. in fact I am pretty successful despite having substantial setbacks. When I get stressed out I just become very sadistic and narcissistic to those I dislike.
1	An over stressed ENTJ? Whose Fi is pretty strong? \n\nWhen I used to be depressed, my Fe came out a lot. I used to correct other people and fight for what's right. That was also the time I found out about mbti and I typed myself as an ISFP. But then when depression faded away, I became more of my own self and o got to know more and more about myself. Then I discovered the mbti functions and typed myself as an ISTP. I'm no expert.
5	Slightly off-topic	Does anyone actually go on those discord chats? I see them being posted here and on r/mbti all the time. 
3	I've always thought about it, but I'm pretty shy so I'd probably just lurk most of the time if I joined up with one anyway. Curious to see what the chats are like, though.
1	I'm on a few of them.  They're OK I guess.
1	I still don't really know what they are...
1	I joined a Skype one once but they had a pretty comfortable group going and and it was hard to get into.  I'd be open to checking out the discord ones though.
1	I'm pretty active at Parrot's Typology discord server, but nowhere else really.
10	would anyone be interested in an isfp music group?	We could do Google Hangouts and watch other people make music / take turns screencasting, it would be like a small audience of fellow Composers, or we could make a joint soundcloud account. Like an ISFP record label. Or we could do a group chat kind of thing.\n\n1 of the reasons I thought it would be cool to do this is because a lot of ISFPs are musicians (obviously), and a lot of ISFP music seems to transcend genres, so naturally ISFPs should be great for critiquing / making music together. I was on another music forum and someone literally said "I don't have anything to compare this to so I can't give feedback on it" (very heavy Si).\n\nPlus it would be fun to have a small like minded group to work with, of people who are mostly nice, thoughtful, and artistic.\n\ncomment / PM if you would like to join or have any ideas.
6	Very strong moral opinions and emotions, is this normal for isfp	so I have been warming up to the fact that I am likely an isfp.\n\nI have noticed that I have very strong moral positions on a lot of things, without reasoning them out. For example, I got a letter about West Point, and it made me feel very sad to think about the fact that people want to join the US military, let alone consider it honorable, with its atrocious record of human rights (slaughtering Indians / invading foreign countries for no good reason and stealing tax money to pay for it / etc) and loss of life on both sides, and how we basically live in brave new world.\n\nAll the descriptions I read about Fi sound like Ti applied to ethics which I suspect is a misleading description.
3	I would say that it's probably common among ISFPs, considering we are Fi doms. Fi essentially is our own inner subjective moral compass and it's what we use most when approaching the world. Everything will be weighed against it and it's essentially the basis for how we make decisions. 
1	What do you mean by reasoning it out? Like thinking about how you feel about something before thinking about how it makes sense?\nBut yes, I can't speak for all isfps but it's normal for me. I don't like apathetic people for this reason and get angry over things in the news very easily.\nAlso, I hate the bullshit descriptions of harmonious, peace-loving isfps. May be true for type 9 isfps, definitely not type 4 isfps.\n\nWhat do you mean by Ti applied to ethics?\n
1	it's the Fi-Ni sync. as an ISFP with the overabundance of Fi, the Ni ends up supporting it. This is why it is so important to energize the Se regularly. Se helps balance out our Fi. At least that's how I see it.
2	ESFP or ISFP?	I have a simple problem where I can't really decide if I feel more extroverted or introverted. Ofcourse that's what the I and E stand for. But is there really any other difference other than that? As one is called an Adventurer and the other Entertainer. Maybe a little bit of information other than what I may know?
4	check the cognitive functions. Fi for isfp. Se for esfp. Also keep in mind many descriptions make Se-dominants seem dumb, but they are not\n 
2	I'm an INFJ who got typed as an ISFP in a work test, and now I'm wondering	How can I tell which type I am? I identify with both descriptions. What are the essential differences?
3	 ISFP has Fi Te while INFJ has Fe Ti. Go read up on the interwebs about the differences between these functions and see which ones you can relate to.
1	As an isfp I don't feel comfortable with Fe at all. Dating an isfj has made me realize this. People have called me selfish and I admit I can be self-absorbed. Many Fi dominants will relate to this I think.  Knowing myself is more important than making other people happy with me. depressedhappiness has a point with the cognitive functions.\n
15	Pst... Please come out of hiding to share - what do you wish People just knew about you?	So, just trying to figure you all out. It seems like as a type, you guys have a tough time externalizing thoughts. Totally relatable as an intp, as I really enjoy when people just "get it". So what do you wish people understood when talking to you? \n\nSpeaking generally is ok, but come on... the personal specifics are always an interesting treat 
22	I wish people would have the patience to get to know me. I'm a very private person but once you earn my trust and get to know me I'm pretty cool. At least in my mind. I wish people knew that I have a group of friends. I feel like my peers think I don't have many friends/cling onto acquaintances. Which is partially true, but I do have a solid group that I regularly interact with. It may not seem that important although it would really help my self-esteem if I knew I was higher up on the social hierarchy. Another thing is that I wish people would get is I'm much more than nice and quiet. I can be sarcastic. I have strong opinions. I'm stubborn. I crack jokes and love dark humor when it's done well. I wanna rebel and experiment with drugs. I have a reputation of being a goody two shoes and it would be nice if people knew there was more to me than being this shy and awkward person.
13	I wish I could verbally explain what I'm feeling. My thoughts come through as visuals and feelings so it makes it very difficult to express my mind verbally within a conversation. 
13	I'm not sure if it's that I wish people knew something about me, it's more so I wish that people didn't overlook me so easily.  In a lot of cases I end up as a "third wheel" of sorts when I'm out with friends, and I'm not often taken very seriously.  
7	Something that frustrates me the most is that my friends, whom I've known for years, still assume that because they do not know every detail of my life, that I don't trust them or feel close/comfortable enough in our friendship. Here is my thing: I've been through some rough patches but I've never felt the need to tell anyone because there is nothing that can be done to change it. Why bother living in the dark times when the NOW is bright and happy? \n\nI'm not secretive or guarded - ask me anything and I'll give you the honest truth. However, I prefer to live in the now and take life as it comes rather than dwelling on the past. I've made a lot of mistakes. I'm terrified of what people will think if me when they find out. But I am by no means uncomfortable or distrusting of my friends. 
8	That i'm really sensitive and get hurt easily even if i don't show it
5	I wish my roommate/long time friend understood that I don't talk about my life activities. He thinks I hate him. I'm pretty sure he also thinks I have no life outside of work because I hear his girlfriend joke about how I never leave the house except for work; I just never announce where I'm going when I go out. I love spending days at Chapter's and my favourite guitar store.\n\nI've never told people about my day to day life. The only time I share thoughts is when I have something to discuss that explores an opinion I have. Things like music, video game design, people in general, and other things.\n\nI've told him this before but he still doesn't get it.\n\nI also wish people understood that I don't like partying. I don't like to drink a lot or do drugs, I'm picky when it comes to music, and I don't small talk well. People think I make up fake excuses to not go parting but the truth is even though I've had good times at parties before in my life (before I stopped drinking to get drunk), it's always been such a draining experience that takes days of emotional recovery.    
5	Sometimes people think I'm not having a good time with them, because I'm quieter and I don't really express enthusiasm the same way they do-- and they stop inviting me to things because they say I seem bored or disinterested.  I wish they could see that I enjoy them more than it seems!  I'm like a dog trapped in a cat, and I have this curse that I can't reveal I'm actually a dog.
2	I don't see much need to express myself\n\nif they like me, they like me, if they don't, they don't. i'm not going to put on a show for someone / brag about myself / self deprecate.
2	i wish people knew why i sit alone in a crowd of people during lunch.\ni wish people would not simply think i'm strange for not sharing during a conversation in witch i have nothing to add but find interesting. \ni wish i could get close to someone and openly share feelings with them.

5	How do you stay motivated for a long term goal?	For example: single college semester. \n\nI'm usually motivated during the start of the semester. Then in the middle(or even earlier) i get bored and start to lose all motivation. When i lose all motivation it becomes very stressful and i often give up. \n\nJust need some guidance from some older (or wise younger ISFPs) \n\nPlease do your best i kind of really need help here. \n\n\n\n\n
6	I think this might be common among us ISFPs.  We're really excited to start something new, and we're really excited to finish up.  It's the in between that seems to suck all the motivation out of us.  \n\nI'd just ask, what are you taking in college?  What are you hoping to do with the classes? 
3	Yes I also struggle with this. Help haha...
1	I found that I had a similar issue, but found that during the middle of the semester I wasnt motivated because there really wasnt much to do in regards to school work. I decided instead to spend most of my free time on my hobbies that I enjoyed, and then buckle down for 3-4 days before a midterm. Personally I found it useful because I wasnt anxious during the middle of the semester, while also staying happy doing the stuff I actually wanted to do. \n
9	How well would you be able to cope with fame?	Considering the fact we're pretty reserved and value privacy? I once read a thread where they typed Michael Jackson as an isfp and something like he was pretty introverted, but when he was on stage he transformed in this badass with sexy dance moves. Would you experience stage fright or if the media gets on your skin, would you have a Britney Spears-esque meltdown? \n\nSemi-related but I'm not sure how good am I with entertaining a crowd however I always dreamed of being the person playing guitar at [1:33](https://youtu.be/gqXMBXTe8CM)
3	I don't think I'd handle it well. I like privacy and being famous seems like the exact opposite depending how famous you are. Like I would never want to reach Michael Jackson fame because everyone knew who he was and he could never go in public without people being all over him. I love the days when I go out by myself and I'm unbothered and that would never be a possibility. On the flip side, it'd be really, really awesome to know how much happiness you bring to others' lives. \n\nOn your comment about being on stage, I have a similar feeling to you. In high school I was a techie for the drama department and often I would think about how cool it would be to be a performer on stage instead. 
3	I feel like I'd be like...I dunno, Hillary Duff. Famous, does her job, but generally stays out of the limelight unless it's related to work.\n\nShe might not be the best example but she was the first to come to mind.\n\nI don't think I'd go out enough or do anything crazy enough for the paparazzi or media to harass me THAT much. All they'd get is "Starburstnova went to get groceries...as she always does on Wednesdays..."\n\nOverall I think I'd handle it okay. The hardest part honestly would be dealing with fans. I'd be super appreciative of them, but trying to keep up with them and socialize with them would leave me feeling drained. So I fear I would come across as cold, ungrateful, and unappreciative. But then again with the internet, I could probably connect enough and not feel as much pressure to do it in person.
3	Jimi Hendrix had the same effect when he went on stage. He felt the most confident and comfortable with a guitar in his hands. As an isfp musician myself I feel similar. I feel nervous thinking about it and before a show but once on stage it's all about the feeling of the music, the crowd is only barely in mind. Due to the expression exertion I experience a meditative state from the feeling of frequency and vibrations. I feel fame would be better handled through the arts for us because we can sort of "hide" or disguise ourselves.  
1	I don't think I'd handle it well. I like to try to blend in and not be noticed which is hard because I'm 6'3" and 270. I'm pretty easy to make out and feel that I stand out badly. Part of that may be social anxiety making me think I stand out more than I actually do. Point being I don't handle it too well now so I don't think I'd be able to leave my house knowing so many people would recognize me and want to interact with me. 
1	I wouldn't be able to handle it.  I've legit had nightmares where I became a famous celebrity.  Nothing out of the ordinary ever happened, I just became big and famous and I had all this attention.  That kind of thing scares me because of a huge lack of privacy.\n\nAnonymity is underrated.  
9	How do you Perceive this picture?	This is originally from another MBTI forum. This test is meant to tell the difference in ways the N types and S types perceive the world. \n\n1. Look at the picture.\n2. Casually and promptly describe how you perceive the picture. What you notice, what you think, what you feel, etc. Freely.\n3. Let us know your type if you are not ISFP.\n\nI will refrain from adding my impressions in this post because I would like people to participate with an unbiased state of mind. So please post your own impressions first before checking out what others perceived!\n\n[Picture](https://i.imgur.com/xKacshP.jpg)\n\nI will edit the post later to include what each type typically perceives.\n\nEdit: Instead of typing myself, I'll just post a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/603ksg/how_do_you_perceive_this_picture/?st=j0jlkjsf&sh=440ba48c) to the same question I asked in r/infp! Thanks for participating all!\n
10	Upskirt of the Eiffel \n\nMark as nsfw please \n\n
3	Eiffel tower. From below. Yep
2	Grey. Fisheye. Decent composition, really, but boring none the less. It's a touristy shot by some-one who is not a total noob at photography. Pretty uninteresting for anyone but the photographer, to remember the trip by. \n\nNow, what was I supposed to think? :-D 
2	I see the Eiffel Tower, the weather looks pretty grey, there's one tourist in the foreground with a bright orange jacket. Not much else to say really.
2	Weird, distorted shot of the underbelly of the Eiffel tower.  Not sure what the photographer is trying to accomplish besides making the Eiffel tower look fat...most likely a tourist pic.
2	The perspective makes it seem like the Eiffel tower is imposing on you... it kinda surprised me at first, lol
2	Tall overpowering building, small helpless people
1	I feel like I'm looking up at the underside of an elephant or turtle.
1	I see the Eiffel Tower, from the bottom. The weather is slightly ominous to me, or maybe that's just the grayish sky. Some tourists of all ages walking around. Must be pretty cold considering most, if not all are wearing pea coats or jackets. A lot of couples roaming around and parents with their kids. I see a man helping out this old woman. Looks like it's gonna rain soon and people want a quick look at the tower before it does. 
1	It's the Eiffel Tower. Icon of Paris. Not ISFP.
1	Obviously the eiffel tower stands out. Makes me think of France and how I heard that they're jerks. Also, the clutter of people reminds me of my plans to be alone when I get out of work. Now I feel excited. Also, that red shirt is pretty bold. \n\n\nSincerely, an intp 
1	a tower climbing toward the sky. people around, hope.\n\nsuspect ISFP?
1	Kinda boring shot of an Eiffle Tower. I got a negative impression of that situation because those crowds. I would prefer if there would be noone. ISFP.
7	Do I sound like an isfp?	I am currently 16 years old? My hobbies range from experimenting with fashion to researching and listening to music. I don't dread small talk but I'd rather talk about something interesting like art, music, fashion. I have no problem greeting strangers I say good morning and move on. I've been called sensitive by both family members and teachers. I hate conflict whenever I see someone arguing I cringe up badly. I love music whenever I listen to music I get these weird sensations and I start pacing back and forth. Daydreaming is also one of my favorite hobbies as well whenever I go in my room and lock my door I start making up scenarios in my head and or thinking of romantic things to do with my crush lol. I have been called quiet/antisocial by distant  family members but my immediate family calls me talkative and weird. I'm very in tune with fashion. Usually I can visualize outfits in my head which sometimes distracts me in class! I have a very short attention span and if something don't interest me I tend to listen to music or just drown myself in my thoughts lol. I'm very observant and notice social cues easily. But yeah I just wanted to know do i sound like an ISFP?
3	Indeed :)
2	Sounds like you very well could be but honestly that's not a ton to go on. The main /r/mbti sub has a nifty questionnaire to help people type you.\n\nAs for greeting strangers, introverted doesn't mean shy or terrified of people. Hell, I have social anxiety and I'll still say hello to strangers. Greeting isn't the same as initiating a full-on conversation though. That would be less of an ISFP thing to do.\n\nIntroversion is how you energize yourself. Extroverts get energized when around people and drained and bored when some. Introverts get drained by socializing (but it doesn't mean they don't enjoy it) and recharge when alone. It's more complicated than just that, but it's not an outgoingness indicator like many assume it is.
1	Introverted part is usually interpreted as taking energy from being alone. And consuming Your energy by spending time with people. The part that You lock Your door is introvert spot on.
9	Are some ISFPs interested in languages?	There was a talk about MBTI on a forum of a quite popular language learning app and a surprising majority of people (60%) were INFP. It is surprising because INFPs account for 4% of population.\n\nI was wondering if some ISFPs share this interest and affinity towards languages.
2	I definitely do
2	I definitely am. I think linguistics are fascinating and I love learning about regional dialect differences. I would love to be a polyglot but I currently only speak one language. I'm starting to learn Esperanto. I'm in the last chunk of the duolingo tree right now.
2	Language is awesome! I would love to learn another language, or several if I wasn't so lazy.
2	I'm super into spanish, and I've retained it years after graduating. But I was extra motivated to learn since my grandpa is Colombian. And I used to test as INFP years ago, which might be relevant to your initial statement. 
2	I am, too lazy to stick to it though 
1	I love learning languages. I am fluent in two languages, and I also took two other language classes in high school. I still remember a lot of what I learned, and I intend to use it as best as I can when I get a chance to travel, and I am always open to learning new languages (though it does take a lot of work)
1	I have no affinity for languages...if it's not a language I need to use in my day to day life I probably won't learn it haha.
1	I can pick up languages pretty easily, I placed at a tri-state spelling bee back in 5th grade
1	I have always loved different languages! I am currently fluent in 3 languages. Also took French in high school for 3 years, but I never used it enough to retain it. I can still remember a lot of the words but not enough to actually say I'm fluent in it.
1	Hey, I know this is super ancient, but I'd like to chime in. I'm ISFP and super into language. I speak Mandarin at a fluent level, and German near there. Soon I'm going to start seriously learning Russian. I've also dabbled in a couple of languages such as Italian, Icelandic, Esperanto, and Dutch! 
11	How do ISFPs appreciate music?	Do they listen to a few songs they really like over and over again before moving on to other songs?\n\nOr do they listen to a wide variety of songs?
26	The first one is pretty accurate for me. When I discover something new and I really like it, I tend to listen to it for weeks and nothing else. Right now I've got several songs that I've become obsessed over the past week. 
10	It depends on my mood. If I find a song I really like I'm gonna listen to it until I hate it lol. If I'm in a non-specific mood for listening I'll throw on a playlist with a huge variety in genre. So, both.
3	Some days I'm in the mood for old favourites, but on other days I like to check out new bands and such. 
2	I get stoned and then listen to [Pali Gap by Jimi Hendrix](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xz9fh_jimi-hendrix-pali-gap_music) on repeat
2	I don't understand. I listen to a (very) wide variety of songs over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I have spotify since december and usually at morning I choose a playlist and listen to it for whole day. I don't have a lot of playlists, and I also have a playlist that is called "Liked songs from radio" which is basically a mix of songs from all my playlists.
1	First one, and I listen to music based the beat and what I'm doing.
1	I'd like to say that being an audio engineer I like to listen to all types of music all of the time.. but really I end up putting whatever is fire to me on repeat *__^
1	I'm a school band/chorus/drama teacher. So, for me, listening to music cannot be mundane. I like to rotate through playlists during my morning workouts. I can't remember the last time I placed a song on repeat.
1	Both. I listen to the songs I like over and over and move on and explore other music. What I like to do is what I call "rediscovering" music. I remember old songs from my childhood and listen to those. The nostalgia factor is strong. I'm not really an album listener. I like listening to the artist's hits and maybe some remixes, covers, and acoustic covers. Or I skip to a certain part of a song and listen to just that part. 
1	I listen to the songs i like daily like 8 times (i always have like 5 - 15 of them) until i move on to other songs/artists/bands. I'm always searching for new songs tho. Music is my life, because i'm a musician myself.
7	ENFP starting to date an iSFP. Any advice?	So I've been dating a friend for the past month. She recently took a test and is ISFP. I've tested ENFP but am close to being an ENTP. We've been friends for about 5 or 6 years, and we ran with the same group of friends. She is very introverted and seems to be ok with listening to my whacky ideas and stuff I talk about. We don't see each other alot but we talk online off and on, because of her busy work schedule, but when we do hangout we have a lot of fun and she loves my affection and we get almost childish when intimate but it's great. She is really caring and loving. We also go on hikes together and she helps me go shopping. We see movies and have  alot in common. So I guess my point is is there anything I should know and any advice I should get?
13	Things I learned from dating an ENFP (sorry if this sounds less than cheery): \n\nMy advice is to be really careful not to trample on her. And I know you don't intend to do so, but the thing with ISFPS is that you won't even know you're trampling them because they're so gentle and tolerant that they will sacrifice their own happiness for yours without even realizing it. And she might have to make a very conscious effort to communicate her thoughts and feelings as honestly and unabashedly as you do, and you might have to make a very conscious effort to stop and listen when she talks, or when she doesn't talk. \n\nShe may say things quietly and succinctly, but that doesn't mean any less than when you speak with all your enthusiasm and gusto.  Always encourage her to give her opinions and support her when she does. When you disagree, try to resolve things calmly. ENFPS sometimes have fun arguing, and you might feel like you can always win by being louder and feistier, but it will only lead to an unbalanced and unhealthy relationship.\n\nIt is already a good start that you're learning about her personality though :) my ex didn't believe in mbti, he basically compared everyone against the same standard and thought that all the ways I was different from him were just flaws that I needed to resolve. 
5	One thing I should say is in the future she may be wary of my drug use. I don't believe in using heroin or cocaine or anything like that but I'm an everyday Marijuana smoker and believe in the benefits of psychedelics alot. She seems to be really understanding of that stuff when I explain how I feel about it but I still think she subtly doesn't fully approve. She also doesn't smoke Marijuana much but has in the past, even with me and haven't in the relationship yet but she's open to doing it again in the future, it's just she got anxiety from doing it later on. she's also willing to tripsit me if I ever do anything so I think that's good.
2	Thank you so freaking much OP, I was about to post the exact same thing!
12	A short video summary of the ISFP personality type	Hey Guys, I am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project.\n\nI just finished the ISFP video and thought I'd let you know :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjYSYxcQkoo&list=PLNEe4b41ZB2ZY1WwQahLvwH4iq_YEN_x7&index=14\n\nI really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think!\nEnjoy! :)
3	That video was very flattering :) thanks for sharing.\n\nSome of the stereotypes seemed a little off, specifically "great ability to focus and concentrate" :P
1	I don't like videos made about "me" without my input into the video. Stopped watching after 1 minute mark.
1	> As an ISFP you are great at day-to-day details\n\nwtf? this is ISFP not ISTJ.\n\nAlso I don't relate to any of the weaknesses you mentioned, I don't think this video is super accurate\n\n2 of my favorite hobbies you mentioned though (the arts and skiing)\n
20	Does anyone else get stressed out incredibly easy?	Over stuff that I shouldn't even be stressed over\n\nIt's so annoying. Even when I'm supposed to relax, I can't 
12	I'm really easily stressed by the things that stress me out. But it's really hard for me to get stressed by things that don't stress me out. If that makes sense.
5	No, it's actually pretty hard for me to get stressed. I'm enneagram 9w1 if that says anything
3	I am easily stressed at work. I put myself there at 100% and what stresses me is that my client sometimes has ideas taken straight from moon and I try to meet deadlines for those ideas and I'm stressing I will not meet them. When actually I should tell my client to get his shit together and plan workflow properly.
3	I also get stressed very easily too. It's the anxiety with a hint of ADHD so my brain is just uncooperative whenever I need to do life. 
2	Yes, stress completely shuts me down.
2	No, thankfully; however, this is probably because I can't deal with day to day "adult" responsibilities and pass them off to my spouse. When I'm at home I just get consumed with loving on my animals.
2	Yes. More over social stuff, like worrying if my friends actually like me or if they're secretly talking behind my back. Also, stressing about what actions will affect me in the future and the ones that don't. I push it to the back of mind so it doesn't interfere with everyday life, but if I don't find some outlet to vent my feelings, sooner or later I will have a breakdown. 
4	What does "successful" mean?	My wonderful friends! Please explain with Your words what does successful mean to You? Like: Successful person is someone who... (?)
9	By definition, successful means achieving the things that you wished for. So it's all relative! For someone it can be a happy, harmonious home. For someone it can be multi-million dollars. For someone it can be the key to the White House. For someone it can be getting humanity to Mars...\n\nFor me, I just want to find my place  and add joy to the world. There is still so much negativity in the world. I can help dispel that by being a joyful person who makes people happy.\n\nEdit: So, to answer your question, "A successful person is someone who achieved what they longed for."
1	Do you do what makes you happy and does it, at the very least, pay the bills?
1	IMO:\nSuccess = money. Having more money, means being more successful, right?
10	Do you sometimes get overwhelmed by your feelings?	Today I was having lunch with a friend. Then a YouTube notification came up. I checked it and it was a video of a newly introduced champion in a video game I play. In it, there is this girl engineer, and after a few moments I thought about how nice it is that people are introducing characters like this to break stereotypes and empower children. Then I thought about all the discrimination women had to endure to this day and the thoughts turned into feelings and they all overwhelmed me and I welled up, my eyes brimming with tears, almost spilling. My friend (girl) asked me (guy), "What's wrong, your face is red?" and I waved it away. People at next table were glimpsing at me as if I'm weird. (I was.)\n\nA few days ago, I was listening to a Hungarian guitarist, and his sounds were beautiful but the way he conveyed them was even more beautiful. And I remembered this Spanish violinist whose music lifted me up from my severe, suicidal depression years ago. Then I was thinking that this guitar dude is "literally" saving people from death with his music. That moved me and I welled up and this time I was alone at home so I shed a tear or two and sniffled.\n\nDoes this happen to ISFPs too? I know some INFPs and they all attest to that this happens to them. I was wondering if ISFPs experience this too, since they are feelers too. There's no ISFP near me.\n\nI feel as if my emotions are on steroids. These episodes are becoming more and more frequent in my life. Is this a symptom of some psychiatric condition?
6	I have found that this happens to me more often when I am stressed or when I haven't been sleeping well. I found that if i kept physically healthy I was less likely to feel overwhelmed with feelings. 
2	I can relate to this.  My emotions always seem to hit me hard, and I feel like I often have to keep a rein on them so I don't explode into super happy ecstasy, super sad depression, etc.  \n\nIt's definitely not exclusive to INFPs.
2	Yeah, it definitely depends on my mood.  One day I drank some tea and I thought it tasted so beautiful I almost got a tear in my eye (it was some amazing tea, not that plain old Lipton stuff).  I might also get emotional if I see a plant sprouting from a seed I planted, only if I'm in a delicate mood. But usually I am unaffected by material things, and the emotions are more likely to come from me remembering or contemplating something, like you said with the woman's equality example.
2	Yes I bottle until I explode. It happens a lot when I really  don't want to do something and my anxiety about it has built up to a huge level. Also if I'm too tired or stressed. I also live in a bad environment for me and was abused emotionally and neglected as a child so I can get triggered easily by a lot which will cause me to get overwhelmed. I'm also a 22 year old guy if that matters. I have depression anxiety and ADHD innatentive. 
1	I begin to get a lump in my throat occasionally when listening to certain pieces of classical music (Mozart's Requiem for instance). Watching those animal neglect videos featuring Sarah McLaughlin pretty much short circuits everything.
8	Do ISFPs have a narrow scope of interests?	Do they have few interests that they explore to the very bottom? Compared to other types?\n\nI'm asking this because I'm trying to tell if I'm an ISFP...
7	I don't know if its an ISFP trait, but I have a few interests that I delve into deeply but only a few. I typically attribute it to my laziness though.. 
5	I can relate to this as well.  I do explore other things outside of my scope lightly though, so I'm not totally close minded.  But I only have a set few interests that stick around.
4	Definitely me.  I have very few interests but I'm overly passionate about those interests.
3	Can't say for other ISFP or other types, but I feel it's that way for me. That's not to say I don't have appreciation for things outside my interests though - I've traveled to various places in the US and abroad, played different musical instruments, taken singing and art classes, and studied several languages. But in the end, I wouldn't say I was interested enough to dedicate my life to doing or studying any of those things further. Whenever I'm truly interested in something though, I tend to get really into it.
2	I'm very conscious of trying to avoid having a narrow scope of interests. I don't want to be really good at one thing and be useless trying to do anything else.
2	My parents were already old when they had me so I wasn't updated on pop culture. I was pretty sheltered as a kid too, so lack of exposure to things didn't help either. I definitely need to branch out and try new hobbies because right now I'm losing interest in current ones and I'm terrified I won't have much of a personality. Sometimes I feel like I hang onto interests for the sake of it. I know eventually I have to let it go because I no longer enjoy it. It's difficult to make friends when you have a niche set of topics you want to discuss while the other person has no clue what you're talking about.
1	If you asked 3 years prior, I would've said yes, but I've found that I value exploration both related to my senses and how I express myself. I do, however, like to hold close to what I know I like/dislike, just to prevent myself from being the "mindless/cool with everything SP type." I don't mean that in any pretentious sort of way, I know for some of those individuals, there's usually a bit more to it.
3	Suggestions for Gifts?	Hello my Se cousins, I'm in need of your help to find a gift for an ISFP-bro of mine. Any suggestion is appreciated.\n\nBefore you say "its the thought that counts", let's just say I would leave a dead bird on his doormat and call it a gift.\n\nThat would freak him out for sure, but the joy of giving would certainly be one-sided.\n\nAnyway, I noticed he liked cool & comfort things. My friends and I got him a bean bag chair last year and he couldn't stop grinning. \n\nI usually give people knives (its practical), was planning to give him a balisong, but turned out they're illegal. (Some laws are stupid)\n\nNow before I buy him a balisong comb, anyone have alternative ideas?
1	I have a close ISFP guy friend who has a very strong aesthetic sense and loves to read romance novels , so you could get them a book? Maybe poetry. If they like to read that is. 
1	What sorts of things does he like? What are his hobbies? 
1	Accessories for building outfits. A neutral colored scarf, for example.
5	Just Need Someone To Talk To someone And Just Get All This Shit Off My Chest.	Buckle up people because this is gonna be a long ride.\n\nLets start with January 2016 I was with my girlfriend gonna call her Number 1 as she will be mentioned a lot and obviously don't wanna use her name. And life was okay. I was in a relationship with someone I loved more than anyone. Was trying to redeem myself as I had broken up with her 3 times within around 3 years and every time there was not a single reason to break up with her she was amazing to me, I would just get in a bad mood and make rash decisions instead of talking to her. I also had some problems with housing and had to live with my friend and at first it was alright, but the longer I was there the worse I felt and I was down pretty much all the time, My job at a hotel was shit because a new manager came in and he didn't know what he was doing. and my friends house was making me feel worse everyday that went by. I ended up getting really down one night and decided to break up with my Girlfriend. At the time I was like "Man this is exactly what I needed" she obviously hated me after that as this was now the fucking 4th time, She deleted me off of social media and didn't want to talk to me at all. about a month passes and I realise that I miss Number 1 more than anything and I've fucked up big time yet again, and started really hating myself to the point where I tried to kill myself. As you can tell i'm still here so yeah that didn't work out, After that I was still really down and eventually quit my job as I couldn't bare being there anymore.\n\nI then met some girl online who gave me a lot of attention so we got talking and hung out and all was well. I meet up with some friends and one of them asks if its okay if he asks Number 1 out as they had been spending a lot of time together, In my head I was like 'no fuck off she's mine, I need her' but I couldnt say that so I said "yeah fine" etc so they date, and me and the girl I met online started dating too and I was like man this is sure gonna take my mind off of number 1! a month goes by and my friend says his mum doesn;t want me to stay there anymore, I couldn't argue as you know it's her house. I stayed round a few friends houses for a few days and it got to a point where I had nowhere left, My mum and younger sister were living in really shitty situations and I wasn't able to live with them, Brother was living on his own getting on Cocaine every week, and i'm homeless at this point, My gf at the time said if I have nowhere I can stay at hers. So I did that as I had no other option. Things were okay but I slowly realised that she wasn't the one. Like we got on really well and we didn't argue but she didn't come anywhere near to Number 1.\n\nSo skip forward about 5-6 months and My mum finds a home so I can move back in with them and I was beyond happy as I missed my family. I get a job at a store near me and everything was coming up. But then anxiety decided to say hi, and interacting with customers at worked started to scare me a lot and it got to the point where I broke down and started crying in the middle of the aisle in front of the customers and it was fucking awful. Luckily I haven't had an experience at work as bad as that so far.\n\nI go through a bit of an episode and decide to try and be a better person, as the way I treated the one person I loved more than anything wasn't how I wanted to treat her (Not paying enough attention, being selfish) I avoid pretty much 98% of my friends and for about 2 months I havent seen most of my friends and I realise how much I don't actually like most of them and that they probably didn't help my moods.\n\nNumber 1 is then going through tough times with her boyfriend and I am there for both of them and talking to them trying to help them both through it and it didn't work out in the end. Me and Number 1 started talking a bit more and became friends again and I was so happy because I had missed talking to her so much as we had a lot in common and our humour was similar. I then slowly realise as we talk more that I never actually got over her and so I'm in this mess as my current gf and I aren't doing too great and I've realised i'm still in love with Number 1.\n\nA month or so pass and me and gf have split up. and so one day i'm talking to Number 1 and I get a message out of the blue saying something along the lines of "Are you free? I need to talk to you about something" (bare in mind at this point I have said to her about how I felt about her) I then get a message a few minutes later from my other friend who's pretty much one of the only friends I still like "Saying we need to talk so let me know when you're free" I'm confused as hell and also terrified at this point because someone asking to talk is usually never good. Number 1 messages me saying how they don't know how to tell me this news so she just comes out and says how Her and my other friend slept with each other just a bit after she broke up with her bf, and it fucking crushed me. (quick side note I forgot about. me and number 1 stayed round that friends house one night. Number 1 fell asleep and me and the friend spoke about life and I explained to him about my love for Number 1 and how i feel etc. it confused me because usually he's always super advice heavy or comforting and he wasn't this time so it was odd but I was like eh he's probably just tired) So yeah when I got told that I just fucking broke down for a few hours and basically just cried myself to sleep. \n\nAnd since then I've pretty much just been beating myself up about how much of a dick I was to Number 1 throughout the years and how i've basically thrown away the best thing that's ever happened to me. Been feeling shit about work. and not really liking any of my 'friends'\nOn the plus side its my birthday today and I got some money from family so I can upgrade my PC so I got that going for me (Also quick side update Brother is no longer on cocaine so that's also a good thing) \n\nSo yeah sorry for the stupidly long essay. I just wanted to get this out as I had this bottled up for too long and had no one to talk to about it.

1	Damn. My advice? Move your ass across the country and don't look back. Sometimes a fresh start is the best thing you can do for yourself. 
1	this sounds like Drake\n\nlisten to drake's new project "more life". i think you will relate very deeply to the emotion.\n\nalso i just got rejected the other day and I am working on bottling this feeling into a song
12	Status Report	How are you doing, ISFPs? Spill your guts, some highs and lows, tell us anything about your day or week or month or whatever. Sometimes I like the idea of us being a little community, since there are so few of us compared to most other mbti groups, but I know that we ISFPs can be very reluctant talkers and I don't want to overwhelm anyone :P\n\nIn typical ISFP style, I feel nervous initiating conversation and might delete this sometime in the next 24 hours XD

5	I feel unhappy and unsatisfied with myself, my friendships and where my life is headed (which is nowhere in particular right now). I don't think the people around me/the people that I'm supposedly closest to quite want the best for me, and a lot of this really messes me up but I'm not one to tell them or anyone how I feel. Showing lots of people how I really feel isn't my thing, but fuck it it's the internet I'll do what I want.
3	I'm just chilling out and enjoying a quiet evening 
3	Currently going through a tight squeeze as I'm getting ready to transition to my final quarter of classes before graduating university with my BA degree. I may or may not make it out with my minor since I added it on last minute, but regardless I'm so ready to graduate! It's also a bad stretch of time to start a part time job soon since I'll be so busy until graduation, but here's to hoping I won't suffer too badly haha.
2	NO 
2	just a while ago i decided to cut my hair a little bit (my bangs are a bit too long) before giving up on it and opted to go to bed instead (which was majority of my month) 
2	I'm getting ready to move out to the South Bay area soon for my new job. I'm excited to start adulting lol
2	I've been trying to pick some new frames for my glasses, but a lot of them are so big for my face shape. It's immensely frustrating. 
1	I have to catch up on about 2 months worth of laundry today, wish me luck :D
1	I'm 22 male in college, this is my spring break. We are putting down my dog tomorrow and then I'm getting knee surgery on Tuesday. It's getting scoped to remove two bone fragments and I'm scared I will die during surgery or will make it and be miserable and in pain for a long night time after. I also have ADHD, anxiety and depression and I'm worried about that flaring up. I'll be at home with my abusive family and am worried about taking care of myself because I probably won't get any help from them. It's going to be a rough week, I'll be mourning my dog while recovering from surgery and will probably be pretty depressed, miserable and upset and frustrated with the whole situation. I'll probably be feeling suicidal again but will try to get through it. Sorry about being a downer but that's me I guess 
1	Lifes been pretty hard recently. I have a job on the other side of the country (USA) from my family and girlfriend (we have been dating 2 years before my move) and she can't move out here because she is getting her masters. Its been about 8 months and her and I seem to argue a lot more than we used to. She has been out here to visit me and I have visited her but its still very hard. We both know I will be proposing fairly soon, but I asked for her fathers blessing and he said "no, not yet" to me which has made things extra hard. 
1	Well...where do I start? Life sucks but I'm getting by. The highlights being my best friend and closest confidant died (my dad) so I moved back in with my disabled mom. Then I lost my job (due to the economy) and decided to take an online course to get some formal training (mostly because I've bullshitted my way through life up until now and figure it's about time to get some education) only to have my computer crash. So I'm fatherless, jobless, and computerless all within the last 4 months or so. Go me.\n\nOn the bright side - my mom and I have gotten a lot closer. We are better understanding each other which is important for any mother daughter relationship. I didn't like my job much anyways and had been looking into other things for a while now. Being laid off has given me a rare opportunity to do what I want to do for work instead of whatever is availavble at the time. And as for the computer issue, mine was getting old and wasn't what I wanted from the beginning so I went and got a new one with all the specs and features I need/want. \n\nAll in all - things are pretty good. 
1	Well I'm in this weird place of life. I'm finishing my studies (getting diploma probably around june/july). I have strongly mixed feelings about my work, talked with my boss about it and we will see what will happen. Watched a lot of "stan the moto man" and I'm jealous of life in Vancouver and wonna get motobike badly. Soon gonna spend a lot of money for my braces. Not happy about spending money, but my teeth need that. Just random stuff.
1	i recently told my friend that i loved them and was not rejected but this was never brought back up and was pushed out of her small group of friends and she got another boyfriend.\n
8	What should I do with my life?	I don't quite know what I should do in uni/life in general. There are lots of courses and careers I'd say I'm INTERESTED in, but nothing I'm absolutely head over heels crazy over. \n\nDo you guys here feel this too? What did you end up doing and how did you decide?
2	I'm in the same boat. I've been working working construction for 3 years since I graduated high school and pretty much hated every second. I took classes for CAD and art, but nothing really caught my attention. Psychology has always interested me. Recently decided to live out of my truck and save money to travel. I'm just not sure if that is really a smart life decision and also of I'm just doing that to escape life for a year or two. That doesn't really answer your question, but I relate to your sitch.
1	I switched majors a million times before settling on art and design, because I needed to stop switching if I was going to graduate on time. I like my work in some ways, I do a lot of Photoshop and Illustrator, but I get really bored and restless sitting quietly on the computer all day every day.  I'm thinking of switching my career field, two years out of college, to something less monotonous.  So. ... just know that you have your whole life to explore and figure it out, and sometimes the only way to know what you like or dislike is by trying different things. 
1	You should check out a bit here: https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-careers\n\nI think that key to a good job for ISFP are coworkers.\n\nI personally am a Software Developer. I am into Computer-related jobs since I was 16. I really like software development because it fulfils my inner need for art - my code is my art! I really appreciate my code, and hate on bad code (bad/ugly art for me). 
8	Unhealthy ISFPs	What does an unhealthy ISFP look like?
37	They are shut in their room, but will sometimes come out for food if they care enough to eat.
13	I'd say that a big part of unhealty Fi is being really judgy and not respecting other people's tastes , opinions or values, or even trying to choose what they do, based on what you believe (and not based on what most people believe or on what it socially acceptable like Fe)
4	Me
1	My mom, probably. Her emotional trauma as a child is probably why she's an alcoholic (who probably still does drugs). She takes some things very personally. She has a weird general hatred of church because of one bad experience with one when I was a kid, and one year in my teens (I lived with my dad) she was drinking and basically threatened to disown me if I went to Easter service instead of doing what she wanted, no matter how hard I tried to compromise. She needs things her way, and takes it as antagonism if not.\n\nShe's also burned bridges with most of our family but blames them for "leaving" her, even though she's the one who lies (often for no real reason), stole money, abused my brother and I. \n\nI think overall an unhealthy ISFP would have a "you're with me or against me" attitude, very personal and black and white, and usually deal with their depression or anger through physical means like booze, overeating, sleeping around, etc.

42	Good advice for us go-with-the-flow ISFPs :) I like that it's practical, not-mushy motivation.	
6	Thanks for sharing! I really like how they put these words together so neatly and succintly. I need like, a phone wallpaper of this or something so I can see this everyday as a motivational reminder to myself.
3	What does this mean?	I recently took the MBTI personality test and tested as an isfp. Here were the results \nSlight preference of introversion over extroversion\nSlight preference of sensing over perceiving\nSlight  preference of feeling over thinking \nModerate preference of perceiving over judging \nWhat does this mean?
3	it means:\n  A: you are the middle man/woman/angelic being/potato of justice or\n  B: wait a few days and take the test again for more accurate results or\n  C: this post is wrong and unhelpful... sorry about that...\n
10	So my roomate is ISFP and is down. How can I get through to him?	I want to help him and cheer him up. Also I want him to leave his room and stop numbing himself with videogames all the time. I try a direct approach where I told him that but it didn´t help. So how can I get through to him?
14	[deleted]
9	Don't approach him about his problem. I'd bet that he knows it exists and doesn't want anybody's help with it.  Try to lure him out with things that interest him.  Invite him out to do things that you know he'd like to do.  If you know that you're his friend then he surely cares about you, so tell him that it'd mean a lot if he did stuff with you and your buddies.  Basically just take his mind off of whatever is bringing him down without making it sound like you're only trying to make him feel better.  
3	As with others, I think a direct approach is/was a bad idea, i would only suggest to directly approach him if you think he seriously needs help.\n\nwhat i would do to slowly get closer and try to help him is to ask if you could play video games with him. dont seem overbearing and just try to have a good time and subvertly try to make him feel better. over time keep spending time with him, find a game that you can play together, even better if it had a story type mode so you can start it together and (almost) force him to keep playing with you so you can finish it. just focus on having a good time, and if you both do, im sure he'll start to feel better. over time just drop the fact that if he needs to talk (about whatever he is down about) that he can talk to you. dont be overbearing/over reaching, thats about all the advice i have. hope it goes well for you
2	I know it can suck feeling useless by just not doing anything. But i'd say the best approach is just let him know you are there if he needs anything. and just leave him be, I know it may seem like he's just wasting away playing games etc. But that might be helping him take his mind off of things. 
1	Maybe let him know you're available if he wants to talk but don't pressure him too much
1	Either leave him alone or if you want him to get out make plans to do something and say you are going and ask him to come. But pick something to do instead of asking him what he wants to do
1	I picked up my cat this morning. Then it puked all over the floor. Cats are so cute <3
0	he have that " punchable face"
10	What is your favorite kind of music to listen to?	Genres, songs, and/or artists? 
10	1. Genres: Alternative rock, indie rock, shoegaze, indie folk\n2. Artists: Sufjan Stevens, My Bloody Valentine, The Vines, The Kinks, Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, Neutral Milk Hotel, Itä-Hollola Installaatio, Red Vox, The Doors, Nothing, and Sur-rur.\n3. Favorite song: Sufjan Stevens - The Dress Looks Nice on You \n
6	Alternative rock, heavy metal, pop punk music... Emo music (though I never notice what I liked was considered emo until recently), but no screamo, I don't like it.  Some rap I like. \n\nNirvana, Blink 182, Sum 41, Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, Evanescence, Marlyn Mason, Powerman 5000, Eminem, D12, Dr Dre, Ween, Pixies, Weezer, Cage The Elephant, Megadeth, System of a Down, Linkin Park, Pantera, Beastie Boys, The Beatles, etc :p
5	xxxtantacion
4	Literally everything. Pop, screamo, classical, country, k-jpop. Everything in between. Anything that gets me going really.
3	I think my niche genre is likely post rock. So many bands are purely instrumental and create such emotionally overwhelming music...I have always cared 10x more about music over lyrics, and post rock shows how much emotion can be conveyed without needing to "say" anything.
3	So I've always been very open with my music taste especially over the past 2-3 years. I pretty much like Anytype of Rock/Metal (so many weird sub-genres so just gonna stick with writing these 2 xD) Hip-Hop, Grime, Kpop, Industrial. pretty much anything.\n I'm going to list some of my favourites/things i'm really digging right now:\nXXXTentacion - Legit my favourite artist right now.\nDeath Grips - From the moment I heard Guillotine about a year and a half ago I fell in love.\nK.Flay - very recently discovered her. Great flow, great lyrics.\nNine Inch Nails - I dont think I have to say much, If you havent listened to them I highly recommend them\nDeftones, Die Antwoord, Giggs, Babymetal. 
2	I have interests in almost everything musically (only things I can't do are modern country, death metal, and most rap). I gravitate more toward the heavy side of rock, but not too heavy. Lately, I've been on a kick with a couple more electronically produced rock acts from the same label.\n\nMore specifically, I've been listening to a lot of Blue Stahli, Celldweller, Circle of Dust (sci-fi industrial), and Scandroid (cyberpunk 80s synthwave) lately.
2	Guthrie Govan, Greg Howe, Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, King's X, Big Wreck, Stereolab, Komeda, Soul Coughing .. Jazz/Prog/Fusion .. The Flower Kings, so much good non-mainstream to be had .. Indie/Folk/Newgrass/Americana .. my mind is abuzz with s&^t
1	Way too many bands to name, but here are some I like:\n\nCandlemass\nColour Haze\nConan\nDeathchain\nHIM\nLord Vicar\nUncle Acid & The Deadbeats\nElectric Wizard\nWitchfinder General\nBlowback\nThe Devil's Blood\nGraveyard\nWitchcraft\nThe Obsessed\nWith The Dead\nGypsyhawk\nAcid Mother's Temple\nBarathrum\nSisters of Mercy\nPentagram\nBlood Ceremony\nNecros Christos\nCoven\nPlaga\nMgla\nSammal\nSleep\nDead Congregation\nThe Doors\nLed Zeppelin\nW.A.S.P.\nDream Theater\nHawkwind\nGhost\nPink Floyd\n\nEdit:\nThought I was on INFP forum, but oh well.
1	My music taste is all over the place but in general I'd say pop and rock. I love oldies and classic rock. I know people look down upon post-grunge type stuff but I really do like it, even though it's generic as hell. Breaking Benjamin is one of my favorites. Early Lady Gaga, the Police, Hall & Oates, Michael Jackson, Michael Buble, Daft Punk, and Britney Spears are great too.
1	I listen to a wide variety of music, when people ask me what my favorite band or genre or song is, I can never narrow it down. It changes by the day or the week. But it usually is Green Day or Metallica, sometimes it's The Head and the Heart. I like having iHeart radio on shuffle and hearing new stuff in different generes though.. like I said.. it always changes haha
1	haha listing shit is hard\n\nsome artists/bands i like right now: kanye west (x1000), meshuggah, nine inch nails, young thug, travis scott, chief keef, carly rae jepsen, kero kero bonito, korn, death grips, agoraphobic nosebleed, deafheaven, clipping, [actually yknow what fuck this here's everything](https://rateyourmusic.com/~dugzonecorp)
1	Drake + Mozart + my music
5	I'm a bit baffled by this whole thing	So I did this thing a few years back and didn't really think much of it, but a few of my friends are big into it so I did it as I've changed a lot from when I last did it. I got ISFP and I related to a lot of the things I was reading. the one thing I don't though is the whole 'Artist/creative' thing Like I'm not a musician and I'm not good at art (not one of them people that says they're bad but are actually good) I just don't relate to the whole thing of being artistic and creative. Like I understand that not everything with these personality tests is gonna be 100% accurate but I feel like maybe I got one that doesnt really fit me? idk just curious as to what other people felt about what they got.
3	Yeah the descriptions (especially on 16personalities) are very embellished. What they mean by artist is that you're usually detail-oriented or that you appreciate beauty. The cognitive functions are much more important that the artist label. Introverted feeling, extroverted sensing, introverted intuition, and extraverted thinking. Do some research on them. If you're read through the cognitive funtions and still can't relate, then you're probably not an isfp. But you're not the only non-artsy isfp. You don't have to fit neatly into the description. For example I hate sports. That doesn't make me any less of an isfp. 
3	"creative" does not mean good at art. it means that you can find creative solutions to problems. such as when i was playing D&D, i found a way to use the bones of my enemies, some rope, and some slime to use as climbing gear to get deeper into a pit
1	deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1704  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/21942)
1	I'm not exactly artistic or creative as well, but after reading about the cognitive functions, ISFP is definitely spot on for me.
28	Does anyone else feel like they're hopelessly trapped between introverted and extroverted?	*Disclaimer: I know many of us can find it hard to comment on posts because we tend to feel like what we have to say may have been said or thought already by someone else, but just know that I'm interested in every single word you have to say, whether it's been said already or not. Thanks for being you.*\n\nI'm not sure if this is an original thought or if it's something that's common among us, but I find myself feeling very misplaced in a sort of limbo between introvert and extrovert.\n\nThere's no denying that I very much enjoy my alone time. When you're alone, you don't have to worry about entertaining another person, about if what you're saying sounds stupid, or if you're gonna stutter over your rehearsed words. There's so much peace in being alone, and I love the freedom to choose to do whatever the hell I want without someone paying attention to me. It's easier being alone. I've canceled many a plan last minute.\n\nHowever, aside from the slight relief that myself and many people get from canceling plans, I take little joy from the act. Because while being alone is peaceful, it's also lonely. I've noticed that I don't get any energy from being alone. I may have small, infrequent doses of motivation and ambition, but usually only in the form of cleaning or organizing. I typically do not feel very happy when I'm alone. \n\nI do love going out, being around people, and having many new experiences. I feed so heavily off the energy of the people around me and the environment I'm in. Is that just empathy, or extroversion? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, the raw definition of extroversion is gaining energy from people around you, whereas introversion is gaining energy from yourself. And that's where my conflict of thought comes in, because energy is rarely something I can give myself. But the other side of that conflict comes in where I can get absolutely exhausted from being around people and socializing for an extended period. So other people is where I get my energy from, but it's also what sucks the energy out of me once I have it.\n\nSo really I'm just trying to see if other people feel like this and I'm just over thinking everything, or if maybe I need to think deeper into why I am how I am.\n\n
6	I feel the same way. I'm not one to cancel plans, but when I'm an hour into hanging with friends I get the urge to leave and you described the whole energy thing perfectly as well. I'm drained and unhappy alone, while with people I get a burst of energy from the  start and drain all the energy almost as soon as I get it.
7	Everyone has some of the other in them\n Extroverts do have some introvert and visa versa.\n\nThe question is more which do you go to recharge. This will very greatly from person to person due to your job.\n\nIf you work in customer service where you are helping others, at the end of the day you will want to go home and recharge introvertly. It's the opposite of a desk job where you are just playing with numbers by yourself. \nSo it's okay to have a bit. If you introverted you can still go out and enjoy being extroverted. \n\nFor this reason I like to do the following. \n\nTake the test on a day you feel like you want to be left alone. \nThen take one on a day you want to be with others.\n\nThis gives you your extroverted self and introverted self. You like everyone else is to complex to be one or the other. We all have our social(extroverted self) and our private (introverted self).\n\nThen take those too and see the varient. If you want to talk about it directly to me, shoot me a message. I'll always respond ASAP.
3	I consider myself very introverted; I'm pretty quiet, and I'm usually getting lost in my thoughts, sometimes having trouble following what's going on around me. But the funny thing is I HATE being alone. My ideal situation is to have people nearby, but not to have to interact with them. If I don't have anyone within shouting distance I get depressed and anxious. I like having my own room, and I spend a lot of time in there by myself, but I HATE being home alone. I like to be able to hear people as background noise. I also hate working alone, and I feel much happier working with people (even though I don't say much). In college, I actually preferred studying in the parts of the library that had more students around talking, or even in the cafeteria, instead of the quiet and empty parts of the library. But I usually didn't  bring a buddy with me because I was very independent. Having people around keeps my brain more awake and less spacey/gloomy,  but I like to maintain my personal bubble too.\n\nI feel like I just rambled without saying anything.... take it as you will XD
3	I don't feel *hopelessly trapped* between introversion and extroversion... But I do feel that I am in between them. I think as I get older I get more introverted, but when I'm with people I enjoy being around I can be very extrovert-esque. Around other introvert friends that aren't as in between as I am I feel even more so, but I think it's good for me and my personality. 
2	Hi Datsloth, I hope I'm not too late but, you _could_ be an ambivert. It's definitely original to you to think up something not normally brought up but I think you're not alone in feeling that way (no worries!) Ambivert brings up many searches to google too but I'll include some links here [1](https://lonerwolf.com/ambivert/) [2](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-signs-you-are-probably-ambivert-and-you-didnt-know-until-you-read-this.html)
2	Im not helplessly trapped between introverted and extroverted but I am helplessly trapped between sensing and Intuition
1	I feel the same way too. But I think there's always one that you prefer. The definitions are tricky because I'm an introvert myself but I gain energy from my friends and friendly chatter. Here's the test: if you can go into a crowded place and be confident enough to strike up small talk naturally, you're probably an extrovert. A person who prefers introversion might have to FORCE themselves to make small talk. That doesn't mean they don't enjoy small talk, it's just that it doesn't come as natural. Everyone must experience both extroversion and introversion because humans are social creatures and also need their own time. Without it, it would get either lonely or you would need a breather. It's all about which one you're most comfortable with.
1	I totally feel this post. A lot of times I'll just want to escape a situation and be by myself because I'm tired and want to be left alone. But a lot of times when I'm alone I crave social interaction and love spending time with others. It's difficult haha
1	YES, so much yes.\n\n\nI have been going over in my own mind the last half year or so, contemplating if i am a complete introvert anymore- when i grew up, i was a total introvert. i would never talk to anyone, only exception was my close family. i could totally go all day without speaking to anyone. as i grew up though, i evolved into needing to have friends (granted only a few), i feel there arent that many people that dont want friends tho. anyway, because of where i grew up and how, every couple years of regular school the few (like two or three friends) i had left, although i guess that is a side effect of life- people leaving. during this time i was forced to leave my comfort spot (where all my friends had left) and find new friends. luckily i found some, and i just became naturally more extroverted among them, and very slowly and gradually i became minutely more extroverted with everyone else. my group of friends was small and our group has effectively dissolved. two moved far away, one has infinite friends and wasnt much of a friend when he didnt need to be, and one other has kinda turned into a bitch (i could go into details, but wont). Recently i have become a lot more extroverted, partly because i have had to for work and other non-work, work that i do. \n\n\ni would say i am 70% introvert and 30% extrovert. just an observation i have made- i can be a complete extrovert if i am talking to one person and that one person is an introvert. but then again its difficult talking to introverts, as i know and am learning myself. \n\n\nya, so there are my thoughts. i am sadly in need of new friends once again, and it is always a pain, trust me. no one has gone out of their way to try to be friends with me for a while, and while i do like talking to people i also like being alone and most of the time prefer not to have to talk to anyone (am i restating whats already been said?). so making friends, sigh... its difficult for me to start the conversations (not knowing what i am going into), but i have to do it to fulfill personal needs...\n\n\nhope you enjoyed every single word
1	Yesss yesss lawd yes
8	Book suggestions?	Sorry if this has been asked already. I am feeling very lazy watching tv all day and sitting on my phone when I'm not at work. I used to read constantly when I was a kid. I loved fantasy or just anything really unusual (magical realism). \n\nA favorite author of mine is Haruki Murakami cuz his stuff is just really weird and feels like a dream. But at the same time the way he writes is so beautiful and real like you can see everything he describes perfectly.
2	I also love Murakami. Hard-boiled Wonderland was fantastic and I'm currently reading Wind-up Bird Chronicle. \n\nAs for recommendations I'd say Vonnegut is within the same vein and is also one of my favourites. Maybe Kafka- though I havent read as much  
2	I always recommend the Wheel of Time. Its an Epic Fantasy and every book was a NYTimes Best seller. The only downside for most people is that its 14 books long and all the books are rather large. However I've read them 3 or 4 times through. 
1	I really enjoyed the Dhammapada. If you're interested in Buddhism. 
1	The Giver series is one of my favs
1	Hyperion!!!
1	Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, it's pretty eye opening. and then I revert to The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts
1	Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad is one of my favorites. It's intense but his writing is so vivid it's like reading a painting. 
3	What's the weirdest way you've used your Se?	I once tried to figure out what instruments were used in a Chick-Fil-A ad at 3am. 
8	Haha sometimes during worship at church I try to single out individual instruments and voices by staring at each one of them
2	I never realized it was an Se thing! A lot of times I'll listen to the radio and recognize different music production techniques after I learn about them. Like "wow that side-chain compression is pretty obnoxious"
1	Catastrophic!
1	Never have I ever seen a Chicfila AD... 
5	You know your an ISFP when...	I kind of want a good laugh and wish to hear what you all have to say.
32	Don't actually respond to this but want others to respond so you can sit there and be like "THIS IS SO TRUE" but none of us respond
19	You think you've got a hoppin' social life until your Extraverted friend goes out of town and your plans aren't made for you. 
12	When you wake up at 2:30pm, go eat breakfast, then go back to sleep.
12	When you go into your room to be sad for hours to days and cry your heart out but when you're done, you're 100% done.

2	Don't know my type	At first I get 2x INTJ. Then reading r/intj I made the test to know if I'm INTJ or INTP (I agreed with some characteristics). Then got INTP with low marge, like, 53% INTP and 47% INTJ. Took another test and got twice ISFP (the first time was some years ago, being the first of all INTJ). \n\nFinally, just now, tried this similarminds.com/classic_jung.html and got ISTJ. The result https://imgur.com/jka8Ma5\n\nStart to thinking I don't belong to any type. I think that can happen. Or also, maybe I'm INSTFJP. At least I know for sure I'm introvert.
4	The take this test thing and find out who you are is nice and all. The thing is it does not change you a person. People change and become different with every new experience. So bro don't worry about it, just be who and whatever you are. 
2	Nobody is 100% any type
2	I found that by having someone really close to me who knows my personality and can judge it without my bias will help. Like I put things I thought I was but then my friend's mom (weird I know) took it for me and I got ESFP. I then read it and tweaked it a little to ISFP and found that this was more me. You also have to remember to quote by Bob Dylan that is on the top of the ISFP page is "I change during the course of a day. I wake and I'm one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I'm somebody else." I'd just keep that in mind if you think ISFP is you. 
1	At least the test doesnt say you are 36 Introverted thinking 36 Extroverted thinking. I got that one here. 
3	Looking for ISFPs to join our server.	
9	Can you explain what the server is and why we should be using it?
3	Why is ESTJ OP posting? 
2	OP? Please explain. 
6	ISFP VS. INFP	I always tested as an INFP, but tonight I took a test tonight and got ISFP. I never really identified with all the hyper touchy feelyness that INFPs are known for. And after reading up on ISFPs I'm starting to second guess myself. Obviously they are very similar, but is there any key difference between them? 
12	INFPs are not necessarily "touchy feely" that's just a stereotype. \n\nImo the biggest difference between INFP and ISFP is how wordy they are. INFPs use Ne which explores a wide variety of concepts, which is why INFPs are often quite verbal. They tend to ramble on about many different things and don't seem to have a purpose. \n\nISFPs don't really do this. They tend to be a bit more direct in their communication and would rather let their actions speak for themselves. You won't often hear ISFPs go off on huge tangents like INFPs do. 
3	What's the thing you probably avoid at all cost? 1 Conflicts and confrontation or 2 multitude of choices and ambiguity?\n\n1 = INFP\n\n2 = ISFP
1	Eminem and Michael Jackson are ISFPs 
13	How many of you are "artsy"?	Hello there :) \n\nI've been wondering something about my fellow ISFPs. One of the main reasons why I had such a hard time accepting that I was an ISFP, is that they always seem to be described as "artsy". I've never really been much of an artist myself in any way. I am the sort who likes to "stop and smell the roses" but never had any drive to recreate what I've seen through art. I always felt like I could never do the real world any sort of justice so to speak. Plus I'm just not skilled in that way. \n\nSo how about you? I'm not the only ISFP who isn't "artsy" am I?
6	I used to always draw as a kid, and I've always been very good at it, but I wouldn't actually call myself "artsy." I only like drawing things exactly like reality and I don't really enjoy art museums. And I don't even make art anymore except when I'm paid to do it at work. But I don't feel that "artistic drive" to create and express and whatnot. My teachers in the art program would get frustrated with my lack of creativity. But I definitely have an artistic temperament... I'm moody, I'm fascinated by colors, textures, and materials, and I think things are beautiful that everyone else considers either ugly or mundane. 
4	People have called me artsy, but I am in no way an artist. I can only do stick figures and abstract. I think people call me that because I very obviously enjoy art and totally do the "stop and smell the roses" thing.
5	[deleted]
5	I'd like to think that I am quite artsy... I draw, paint, printmake, and I'm trying to be a graphic designer \n 
4	I turned out to play music and I don't plan to stop :). I've never been happier! 
5	I think I'm pretty artsy. I like drawing, design, crafts and things. Art always is really inspiring to me and I like being creative.\n\nISFPs are called artists, but this doesn't have to be in a literal sit down and put emotions into a picture kind of way. Enjoying sights and sensations can be a sort of artsiness. Art, to me, is mostly about aesthetics and personal meaning. If you are into those, you are "artsy" in a way :)
3	I've always liked art and drawing as kid but I never really pursued it. Now I'm trying to learn graphic design, however my skills are pretty amateur. I've had the artistic drive but sometimes I'm too lazy. While it's fun to make art, I spend more time to "stop and smell the roses."
3	[I write music.](https://www.youtube.com/RushJet1)
3	I know this is old, but... it's a slow sub, and I just found it out, so I'll reply anyway. I also resisted the idea of being ISFP because I don't feel artsy at all. I love consuming art: music, movies, comics, books, I like museums too although I don't know much about paintings. But I never feel like I should be a creator.\n\nIf I'm creating something and it turns out bad, I resent it. THat goes for everything, from cooking to DIY. And if something becomes a chore, I don't want to do it anymore, and you need a lot of practice to become a good artist. So I just settled for being a consumer. I like that 'smell the roses' part, definitely can relate. I just don't feel like expressing myself to people, arts or words, since they'll probably misunderstand.
2	I'm pretty artsy, I love painting with watercolor 
2	I am definitely artsy
2	I'm surprised by the number of artsy replies. I would like to reply that I am too artsy, as I play music and am currently in art classes
2	Yes. Trying to make a career out of illustration.
2	I did draw for some years as a hobby, but I don't feel that I'm particularly creative or innovative. I DO have an appreciation for art though, particularly in the visual aspects. Rather than a creator, I view myself as more of a consumer. :) Having a sense of aesthetics is pretty big for me, and I suspect it applies to most other ISFP "artists" overall, even if they're not artists in the literal sense.
2	I'm a isfp Photographer, I guess that's where my "artsy" side comes out. I also enjoy art in general but I'm not very good at it. But I think the main thing is just the way we all sense and feel things. Not necessarily presenting those things to others in a physical form. For example, I think a lot of us can relate to appreciating colors or smells or moments in general. So I'd say it's the appreciation for senses that make us "artsy" so to speak, not exactly our level of physical artistic talent.
1	For the most part, I am not artistic when it comes to physical media. I have a major music appreciation, though, and would like to work on more projects regarding that. I also used to be really big on writing poetry, and am drawing back on those skills for lyric writing for a musical.
1	He chooses a book for reading
10	Do you ever finish video games?	Generally I tend not to finish games at all, and was wondering if any of you felt the same. I get very excited to buy a game and playing the beginning, yet never get to the end as I either get bored of it, just don't finish it when I mean to or take looong breaks (years). An example of this is Bioshock, as five years on from starting it I still haven't finished it and am only in Fort Frolic with photograph man, where I have been for the past two years.\n\nHowever I have realised I tend to play a lot more games where there is no particular end, or they end quickly. I have over 1000 hours on both Team Fortress 2 and League of Legends. I have a lot of hours on games such as the Binding of Isaac and Terraria, where you can play for a while and stop whenever you want, only to pick it up again months later. I also tend to enjoy games such as Fallout and Skyrim, where I can dick about for as long as I want and start a new character immediately after dumping my old one. Anyone else experience this, or have similar experiences?
3	I have only ever finished a few games, of the close to three hundred I own. Red Dead Redemption, Mount and Blade: Warband, and the first four Halo games. I tend to play sandbox games more than story driven games, so there's that. 
3	Yeah, I finish them all the time, although I tend to play shorter games on average. It's a lot easier to finish a game like Journey or The Walking Dead than it is Fallout 4 or something.
2	It depends. I have over 1000 games and finished only a fraction of them. I don't know why but I just can't finish some of them. Not that I don't enjoy them I just stop playing them. Very few games have me sitting down every day to finish it all up. Mass Effect Trilogy was one of the few I played back to back until it was done.
1	shorter games like crypt of the necrodancer. yes.\nlonger game like this war of mine. nope
1	It depends on the game.  If it's a platformer or RPG or some game that keeps me trying to improve my playing ability or character, or if it's short I'll beat it.  If the game just drags on and the environments or gameplay are too samey, I'll stop playing.  I've started lots of FPS games and quit halfway through for this reason but I finished all the Metroid Prime games because they were very engaging and fun.
1	Yes, if I like it.
1	Ha! This is so true of me. Even the best story games I've played, I still feel this slog in pushing through to the end. I think I hate the idea that all the work put into developing my character or whatever I'm playing with becomes irrelevant, so I tend to focus more on games that don't end. Guild Wars 2 (really any MMORPG...this is my MMORPG du jour), or PvP games with skill caps that I'll likely never reach, like league of legends, Starcraft 2. I like the idea that I can keep developing my skills for as long as I want, and I can still encounter unique challenges.
1	I only finished a few easy short ones like the cave, brothers, heavy rain, Pokemon. I prefer starting them ;D
1	Usually no, this reminds me I still have to beat Pokemon Sun, I haven't played it in almost a month even though I love it. \n\n
9	ISFP Celebrities/Historical Figures?	I don't trust that Celebrity Types site much. A lot of them seem based on shallow/stereotypical reasons. Just based off interviews of your favorite stars, which ones would you guess ISFPs are?\n\nPrincess Diana (somewhat naive in her blunt honesty in that awesome Fi-Se combo)\n\nLana del Rey\n\nBob Dylan\n\nJames Dean\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nBritney Spears\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nJacqueline Kennedy\n\n\nHistorical figures... All I can name off the top of my head is Martin Luther.
2	Ryan Gosling\nMarlon Brando\nLady Gaga\nMarilyn Monroe\nJimi Hendrix\nDavid Bowie
1	Awesome post! I always like to see actual interviews of people who could be isfp to see if I relate. 
1	David Bowie forever
11	Who are some iSFP Characters?	My little list to start\n\nPrincess Aurora  \nMax Caulfield (Life Is Strange)  \nEleven (Stranger Things)  \nHelena (Orphan Black)  \nJessica Jones  \nHarry Potter  \nNewt Scamander  \nLuke Skywalker  \nDr. John A. Zoidberg MD  
3	Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad is most certainly ISFP
2	I thought that Luke Skywalker was INFP? Perhaps not? \n\nAnyway Fry from Futurama is often typed as ISFP. I'm not really into anime anymore but I remember one called Noir. It's nothing special, but Yuumura Kirika (the shorter Japanese assasin) always struck me as an ISFP. \n
2	I actually think Aurora is INFP. I used to think ISFP too and wrote about/did a little chart for her but she's too abstract/up in the clouds with a little Si. Disney Princess ISFP? Pocahontas. :D Very in the moment with slowly blossoming Ni.\n\nOthers:\n\nSally the Ragdoll (The Nightmare Before Christmas)\n\nViolet Parr (The Incredibles)\n\nTzipporah (The Prince of Egypt)\n\nFluttershy (possibly... MLP:FIM)\n\nJack O' The Green (Ridley Scott's Legend)\n\nLaura Ingalls (books, that is; don't know about the show, I need to watch more)\n\nLapis Lazuli (Steven Universe)\n\nArwen and Eowyn (LOTR movies)\n\nRey (Star Wars)\n\nHeather Duke (Heathers)\n\nMary Lennox (The Secret Garden)\n\nImhotep (The Mummy)\n\nPrincess Ann (Roman Holiday)\n\nSoos Ramirez (Gravity Falls)\n\nQueenie Goldstein (FBAWTFT)\n\nRose Tyler (Doctor Who)\n\nDaenerys Targeryen in the books (I think... TV Dany is at least an ESFP, but while book Dany's Fi is apparently, her queen mask she always puts on makes it difficult for me to tell if she's extroverted or introverted)\n\n\n\nIt's nice that we're usually the heroes. :3 But I'd like to see more antagonists.
6	Please help me determine my wife' type	INTJ here. So my wife of 9 years took the test in 2009 and got ISFJ, but it was right after we had our first child. I didn't look into it much back then, but recently I have been reading more about the MBTI and the ISFJ doesn't really fit her. Some parts do.\n\nSo I asked her to take the test again. She took the one on 16personalities and got ISTP. I'm not a big fan of that site, but it is what it is. \n\nNow, I think ISTP fits her better then ISFJ, but I really feel that ISFP fits her the best. \nI posted this on the ISTP subreddit and most people thought ISFP as well. \nHere are some notes on my wife and I was wondering if you all could let me know if she sounds ISFP. \n\n----------\nComes off cold to others but is very sensitive to what I say. Sometimes way to sensitive to my sarcastic jokes. Sometimes she loves my humor, other times she thinks I go to far. \n\nOften takes what I say and assumes something negative is meant or inferred when I was just stating a fact. \n\nShe sometimes assumes I should know what she is thinking, which usually ends badly.\n\nIs a great and loving mother. She is very free to let the kids follow their own path, as long as they don't spend too much time on the ipad. She is great at homeschooling and develops specific learning plans for each of our sons.\n\nHas days where she is very touchy feely and close and days where she is very distant. I used to wonder if she was mad at me, but now I just give her space.\n\nShe does not enjoy abstract concepts as much as I do, such as talks about philosophy, religion, physics, etc.\n\nShe likes graphs and numbers to a point. She has always been interested in stock trading and knows tons about market analysis, etc. She studied to be an accountant but never finished her degree. Usually  has some projects going.\n\nShe's not really into taking things apart, mechanically. I am the one that does that. I always fix her computer, work on the cars and tractors, plumbing, etc. She loves gardening. She is not really artistic but is great with colors. We recently built a house together and she picked out all the colors and they worked great. Very visual learner. She needs pictures to grasp something.\n\nI could never picture her being a nurse, but I could see her being a teacher. She loves children and seems to have way more patience with them then she does with adults. She also loves animals. \n\nShe only has a few friends and is fine with that.\n\nIf she is interested in a subject she will devour anything she can find on it. If she is not interested in anything at the moment, she just watches netflix.\n\nShe doesn't appear outwardly empathetic.  \n\nSeems motivated by emotions. She will make a decision based on emotions and intuition, whereas I will make a decision based purely on logic and my plan. She actually can help me in this because if something has to be decided but I can not see the logically correct course, I can get paralyzed, or change my mind too often.\n\nShe sucks at planning trips. I always to have to plan our trips, and she is happy that I do. She is happy to just be a long for the ride. This generally works out great and we both have a good time. She prefers I drive everywhere, because again, she just enjoys the ride.\n\nHas complete trust in my ability to plan and figure stuff out. If I get frustrated she just tells me I'll figure it out eventually, which does help, because it reminds me to stay with it. She did follow me half-way across the ocean to peruse my dream because she believed in me. \n\nShe is active in some sports. She grew up on the swimming team. She exercises (Tae Bo) every day. But she doesn't like the riskier sports. I tried to teach her snowboarding, but she was to afraid of the speed. Now that our boys are learning snowboarding, she will go to the mountain with us, but just stays on the bunny hill with skis. \n\nShe thinks personality tests are silly, but she indulges me a bit because I explained they help me. I would ask her to take more tests, but it was like pulling teeth to get her to take just the one.\n\nShe loves to read non-fiction and biographies. I read tons of sci-fi and she can't understand why I like it so much. She loves Kung-Fu movies though! She also does like some sci-fi movies (not star wars). We watch movies differently. I tend to analyze them and remember them, but she'll forget she even watched a movie a few months later. It's not that she has a bad memory, I think she just watches movies to relax and be in the moment. \n\nProcrastinates on some things, but not others. She loves a clean house, but her home office is usually a mess. She has taken huge strides to be more organized. Her digital file system is non-existent, meaning her computer files are all over the place and she has like 1000 unread emails in her inbox with 1000 tabs open in her browser. It drove me a little crazy at first, but now I think its cute and funny. \n\n----\n\nI could go on, but I feel like I have gone on to long already. Thanks for your opinions.\n
3	Sounds like an ISFP. 
2	Sounds very very isfp. 
1	Also think ISFP, especially- "If she is interested in a subject she will devour anything she can find on it. If she is not interested in anything at the moment, she just watches netflix." my Se is so much like this. I go through phases usually lasting 2-3 weeks before finding another obsession. I can't help it. She screams Fi, too.\n\nOP however, sounds like an IxTP. or at least, definitely not a Ni dom, which tend to be very hard to come across as well.\n\n"She actually can help me in this because if something has to be decided but I can not see the logically correct course, I can get paralyzed, or change my mind too often." Doesn't sound like Ni-Te at all to me, which would probably pick a course and stick to it easily and without budging or needing a lot of outward advice/help; more like high Ne, though Se is possible. And I don't argue that isn't true of her, but I don't get what you mean by her being value-driven makes her help you to make logical decisions.\n\nI know you didn't ask for a typing for yourself but I couldn't resist. Sorry.
1	These are all behaviours, what are the drivers behind those behaviours? That's what you'll need to figure out to type her.
1	If you want to be sure of your own or someone else's MBTI type it is better to understand the cognitive function stacks. An ISFP is Fi Se Ni Te an INTJ is Ni Te Fi Se 
7	Hey, ENTJ here i need your help	Hey mates, i have an ISFP friend which i love, he is my best friend and is like the brother I've never had. recently, he has suicidal thoughts. his passion is music and life has led him into military service, he'll be done in two years and can pursue him dreams, but he is spent. and i'm extremely worried about him. he keeps saying i can't keep on, and he is just gotten rejected by the girl he loved so hard(whom i resented as hard). i mean, i understand his pain, i'm in a similar situation, and when he exhibits suicidal behaviors it really worries me. i need to do something, i'm an ENTJ, emotional support is not my strong suit, i need advice, how can i make him feel better?
2	The only thing I can think of is to tell him he should go to consoling. I personally have gone to consoling and found it to help a lot with the depression I had. I don't know how that would work with him being in the military. He should know that going to consoling is not something to be ashamed of. Sorry this is the only thing I could think of.  
1	I think you need to figure out the source of his suicidal thoughts. Does he truly feel like he can't ever be happy again? Maybe you need to remind him of the life that is waiting for him when he finally leaves the military. Thinking of doing something we don't like for the rest of our lives or thinking of struggling for the rest of our lives make us go down the hole at a faster pace. I know because I've been there, and I'm still very apprehensive about the future. Be careful about painting a picture that is too optimistic though. We always doubt consolation when we are already in a depressive state. 
1	Hope you're still around. Think i know what you meant by the 2 years.\nI probably went through the same myself. Actually did attempt suicide as well but guess my willpower was strong. Anyways i'm done with my 2 years and continued with life. \nAs an ISFP I can understand how he feels.\n\nI personally did go for counselling as well but didn't find it useful. \nPerhaps the counsellor didn't bode well with him. Maybe you could try a different counsellor. \n\nAlso, emotional support is very important. Try to get him to interact with his friends when he is out.\nMaybe get him to read an inspirational quote everyday (there are many smartphone apps that offer this)\nas he will tend to brood on negative thoughts often. A positive compliment or get him to look at positive side of things.\n\nIf he experiences problems during his time inside, get him to talk about it and discuss a solution or get him to see it in a less negative way (I know many unreasonable stuff happens in there) that will probably lessen his anxiety.\nIt might take a little convincing or encouragement before he will share his problems as ISFPs tend to bottle them up (sometimes to the point where they cant take it anymore) encourage him to share his thoughts.\n\nGenerally talking to people he trusts like friends or family will lighten his mood (If he went thru the same 2 years then I believe he is allowed to use his phone at night)\n\nISFP respond better to encouragement than criticism (Can be very harsh inside for ISFP as the military works on a \npunishment system)\n\nAs for the girl, may take some time for him to heal. Could try to get him to see that there are other better girls or learn from the experience. But might be hard to get through when the ISFP is so caught up in emotions. May really take some time because ISFP feels very deeply in relationships. Whatever you do, don't force an opinion on him. Getting him to share his thoughts and then questioning him on other viewpoints or possibilities to slowly steer his thinking to another direction would more effectively get him to see a better picture of things. An example would be like to ask what he liked about the girl and slowly steer the conversation such that he sees that it is possible to find other girls like her or that one failed relationship isn't everything. He still has opportunities to explore. Although don't force if he is uncomfortable.\n\nAlthough I might be sharing what might help based on myself, but depression being something of a mental illness requires attention. Is still best to seek professional help\n\np.s.\nSorry if the post is long winded and repetitive.\nNot very good at articulating my thoughts\nAny ISFP feel free to add on or correct anything that I have shared\n\nI sincerely hope he doesn't end up *touch wood* at the point of no return.\nAs a fellow ISFP i do hope that he will get better.\n\n--- edited because it was hard to do formatting as I was typing on a tablet previously ---
6	Thoughts on myself and relationships	I'm 22 and have never had a relationship. I'm a guy and I've asked a few girls out but always get a no. I like a girl a work but have no idea what to do but I seem happier when I'm around her which is something since I'm normally quite depressed. So I'll smile and talk to her and try to joke around but I'm worried because it's work so a number of things could go wrong. I don't really know what I'm doing or how to flirt or tell if she likes me back or not. \n\nI do seem to favor my sense of touch so I would imagine if I ever get to have a relationship I would be into physical contact and communication. I can talk but it's usually when I'm interested in something or have something to say so so I'm not very good at small talk but I'm working on it and trying to put effort into that. I'm pretty guarded with my feelings since they are so strong and sad and painful for me so if I was willing to show that part of myself I would really have to trust someone and even then it would be terrifying to be that vulnerable. I also had an emotionally abusive and neglectful childhood though so that could be because I'm so damaged and broken. I'm starting to think it would be better for me to not be in a relationship because I'm so fucked up and don't understand relationships and don't think that anyone would or could ever want me. Maybe it would just be better for everyone to just accept that I'll be alone and try to move on. I've never gotten to experience any of it (even being kissed or just holding hands) and don't really know what it would be like to be liked or be loved. I think it could be nice though, I just don't know who would want a 6'3" 266 pound 22 year old virgin with depression anxiety and ADD who lives at home while in college with no confidence or self esteem and damaged and has issues. I'm working on stuff( I lost 88 pounds) but don't think I could ever fix myself enough to be desirable. 
5	You shouldn't think that you are not worthy of love and understanding-- because everyone is worthy of it. The truth is that most people judge and pick partners based on looks, so your efforts to look better are not wasted. I think self-improvement is a good place to start so you are not doing anything wrong, but self-improvement also includes improving your values and standards for other people. You should probably try to get to know more people and see how well you click with them, and have standards for how they treat you so they don't step all over you. I know how hard it is because I'm introverted too, but if you really need help, reddit is here :)
4	The good news is that ISFPs like us are charming and mysterious and gentle and kind. And ADD can come across as spontaneous, cute and entertaining. The bad news is that depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem make it more challenging for you to reach your full potential. Challenging is much different from impossible. \n\n1. It sounds like you've made amazing progress towards getting in shape. Losing 88 pounds is no easy task.  Take time to appreciate yourself and your progress, and keep working towards your fitness goals. Make sure you're eating healthy food, and enough of it, and not just cutting back. It's not just about losing weight, it's about being healthy, because a healthy body contributes to a healthy mind. Plus, there's a huge confidence boost that comes from seeing progress you've made. And being 6'3" is awesome, a tall man with confidence has a natural advantage! \n\n2. Read the Feeling Good Handbook. Sounds lame, but I reeeally recommend it.  It helps you learn to be aware of your thought processes, and redirect your mind when it starts sabotaging itself. It's not about blind optimism, it's about being fair towards yourself. This book has given me so much insight into the lies that my anxiety has told me, and it has empowered me to take a step back from anxious thoughts and see them for what they are.\n\nRealistically, chronic mental illness can't simply be "cured" in a few simple steps... I do take antidepressants, but they would be much less effective if I didn't put in the effort to take care of my body and mind. I get depressed still, but the key is learning that the negative anxious thoughts are part of the illness and that you can't take them as fact. \n\nDo you take antidepressants, anxiety meds or ADD meds? \nI take wellbutrin, and it turns me from a sad sluggish puddle into an energetic and awake human being. It pulls me out of the fog. I don't know what your depression/anxiety is like, and different people benefit from different antidepressents, but let me know if you have questions. Also, seeing a therapist is important too, at least to try it! 
3	seems like everyone else gave you good responses, I just wanna say good job on losing 88 pounds, that's honestly impressive for anyone
3	You've probably heard of: You must be able to love yourself, before you are ready for a relationship. And this is so true. From what you said I get the idea that you don't love yourself. You can have relationships if you don't, but all your problems will be catalysed and your problems will become the other persons problems, and you will actually reinforce any negative feelings you have towards yourself because you'll be angry that your problems are causing more problems. People who don't love themselves run the danger of subconciously using a relationship to feel better, and it will make you feel better for a while (for all the wrong reasons), but your problems will come back to bite you full force. And you'll risk destroying something good. Or, you'll portray yourself as different from what you are because you are ashamed of who you really are, the other person will fall in love with that persona, and when you break your performance (you will, because you cannot be someone you are not) the romance will collapse.\n\nTake the time to become and learn to be the person that you want to be, a person that you can love; and romantic love will follow out of that.\n\nI speak from experience with my boyfriend: He was 27 when we met, never even kissed someone else before, bad childhood, depression, his mom died a month before we met, deeply rooted insecurities. I think we worked out because we were lucky and are absolutely made for each other, but I'm afraid it's more likely for a budding relationship to crash under those circumstances. I definitely wasn't easy at times for us.\n\nPlus, I've seen the opposite over and over again: a person focusses on cultivating a good mindset (actually believing that they are worthy and lovable just the way they are), other people pick up on the good vibes, the right person will be attracted, and you'll be ready for loving someone else because you're not haunted by all your issues.\n\nDon't despair, your chances may seem bleak, but they aren't. You're young, and with 7 billion people on the world there is definitely someone out there for you. Just remember that you greatly increase your chances of finding and keeping the right person if you love yourself.\n

9	Your perfect match? Mine? The elusive element of compatibility in the midst of abounding infatuations?	What types have my fellow ISFPs have formed successful (2+ years) relationships with? I feel so unique, complicated, and dysfunctional that sometimes I don't know who or what could ever work for a happy, healthy long-term love. \n\nI know there are a million variations within each mbti type, and in the end we're all individuals. With that disclaimer, I'm curious to hear whether other people's experiences can lend insight or guidance to my quest.\n\nI tried an ESTJ, but he was too dominant and insensitive. (But he could be an exception. Thoughts?)\n\nTried ENFP twice, but in both cases the connection was lacking after the infatuation wore off. \n\nDated a possible INFJ, felt a strong connection but our mutual struggle with anxiety and depression accumulated and poisoned the relationship. We were also very young and immature... I suspect INFJ could actually be a good match in healthier circumstances? \n\nWith an INTJ, I felt a strong connection. He was a quiet one, and I liked that he was decisive without dominating, always stable and predictable. He had this beautiful logical computer-brain that would never start drama or read into something I said. Made me calm, eased anxiety. But he had very little social drive and required too much alone time. I felt lonely and neglected. But he loved me as deeply as any robot ever could, with that cold metal heart of his. \n\nSo..... \nTL;DR   What "type" has worked for you?
4	Dated an ENFP for nine months. They were very controlling and I'm really easily manipulated. Took me a super long time to realize I had to break up with them because I couldn't handle the bossiness and emotional control. They flipped their shit and it was really scary lol\n\nDidn't bother testing my other partners for their mbti type.\n\nI can totally see how dating an INTJ would be awesome in a lot of ways.
3	None, never dated/had a relationship. Thinking about it, I don't ever see myself being in an actual relationship with anyone.\n
3	One of my ISFP best friends is married to an ESFJ and I think they're great for each other. Started dating in 2009 and married in 2012. They have two kids now and things are still good.\n\nI have some mini-concept that *some* of the best relationships are where you share none of the same cognitive functions but the same kinds of functions in the same order (I'll explain this in the next paragraph). It works out in the "labeling system" of MBTI that you just keep the two middle letters the same and invert the first and last. So ISFP-ESFJ... ENFJ-INFP... ISTP-ESTJ... etc.\n\nSo in the cognitive functions that MBTI is based on, ISFPs will lead with Introverted feeling while ESFJs lead with extraverted feeling. The second function for both types, respectively, are extraverted sensing and introverted sensing. (I believe) that it works out that many times you end up very similar on the surface about many things for completely different reasons.\n\nAnd based on my relationship with an INFJ (I'm an INFP), we appear very similar on the surface but how we internalize everything is completely different. We agree on many things but for completely different reasons, so it's interesting as long as we are secure in ourselves first and don't see differences as threats. So even if you had the kindred spirit of the ESFJ (an ISFJ) it might work out well as long as you're both able to get outside of yourselves.
1	Sorry couldn't resist :P
1	One INTJ but it didn't work out. It got stale and I never felt emotionally supported, it felt like a robot thinking what he was supposed to do to be emotionally supportive.
10	Why Would An ISFP Not Want to Hang Out With Me?	I'm an INFP and I've been good friends with an ISFP for about eight years now, but these days she hardly ever wants to socialize with me face-to-face. Yet she's always texting me and skyping me throughout the day. She can go for months without seeing me, then once in a blue moon, she'll call me up out of the blue and want to do something and then she'll go through a phase of seeing me a lot...but after a few weeks she'll start shutting me out again.\n\nIt bothers me because we live pretty close to each other and lately I've been really craving some kind of social connection, but she's been avoiding me, cancelling plans etc. Like I said, she texts me constantly but every time I say 'hey do you wanna go for a drink?' she gets all shady and tells me she's in "hermit mode" right now and she just wants to be by herself. But she's lying because there's this other group of friends that she often goes out to bars with and to music gigs etc. I see her mutual friends posting pictures of her online and it makes me wonder why she always says 'no' to me and 'yes' to them.\n\nI tried to be straight with her. I said "look I'm just feeling a bit lonely these days and I'd love to be able to hang out at the pub or just be in the company of you and few other friends". She said something like "yeah we'll have to hang out soon" but it's always really vague.\n\nIs this usual for an ISFP? Why does she call me her best friend and text me lots but never wants to hang out with me? Is she ashamed of me? Is there a better way to get ISFPs attention?
11	Here's whats goes through a Fi egos head:\n\n>Is this feeling appropriate? Why? Why not? Why do I feel this way? Is it me? is it them? How do I want to feel? How do I want them to feel? What am I supposed to feel? How are they supposed to feel? Am I to change how I feel? Why and How? Am I to change how they feel? Why and how? what is right for this moment? What is right for the future? Is this the past coming up? For me? For them? Is it right? Do other people feel it is right? do I care if it is right? Do other people care if I care if it is right? Why are they acting that way? Why am I acting that way? Do I care how I am acting? Do they care how I am acting? Do they care about how much I care about how I am acting? Is this healthy? Is it serving me? Do I care if it is healthy? Why or why not? What would other people do?\n\n>Who am I close to? why am I close to them? How can I get close to them? How much of myself should I reveal to them? Do they deserve it? Do they not deserve it? Will they relate to me? Will I relate to them? How and why? How and why not? How do I act in relation to how I feel about them? Is it right how I think about them? Is it true how I think about them? Is it true how I think about myself? Why do they think that way? Can I change it? If no, what do I do that is most comfortable? If yes, how do I change it? Or, should it stay the same?\n\n>Is this the right time to say something? If yes, then what? Is this the wrong time to say something? If yes, then what do I do? Do I just leave it be? Should I say something? How do I feel about the things I should say?\n\n>How will this effect others? How will this effect me? How will this effect how others feel about me? How will this effect how others act towards me? How will this effect how I act towards others? What is the rules here? Am I creating the rules? Are others creating the rules? Can I follow the rules? Is it right to follow the rules? Should I change the rules? How and why? Should I change my behaviour to follow the rules? do I even want to? If yes, then can I lie to appease them? Is that okay to do? Should I not change my behaviour? If I do not, What will the consequences be? For myself? For them? In the longterm? \n\n>Is it safe? Am I safe to be me? Is it okay if I am not? If I am not, what good can I take from it? Where is this going? where are they going? Closer to me? Away from me? How do I feel about both? Do they see what I do? Do they notice that? If not, is it okay with me? Yes or no? If yes or no, how do I act? \n\n>Who knows who? How are they connected? What is the right thing for me to say in the given situation? what is the right thing to act in the given situation? How can I impress upon them my needs? Do I deserve it? Yes or no? Do they deserve it? Yes or no? \n\n>Was it right? Was it wrong? If it was right, is it okay? With me? If it is wrong, is it still okay? With' me? With them? \n\n>How do they feel about me? How do I feel about them? \n\nwith that in mind its basically anyone's guess\n\nfeeling is way too super complex to give some kind of easy answer to\n\nthey're usually pretty honest though--if you just ask them they'll probably give you the end result of all this deliberation, so you don't need to try and do it for them
3	I am like this, but this person seems a little extreme and it comes off to me like maybe they have some social anxiety. As an ISFP, initiating conversation doesn't come naturally to me (but am working on it), so I'd say that's normal. Like I'm the type of person who will go weeks without talking to a close friends until they message me first. It's how a lot of us are because we're so comfy being by ourselves.

2	deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3820  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/90610)
1	I've noticed that, while I enjoy hanging out with friends, if I hang out a lot with one group of friends, I will be less willing to hang out with the other one.  It's like if all of your "hang out with friends" energy is being expended on one group, and you need to recharge in all the time you're not hanging out with them.  Any time you hang out with your ISFP friend, she may be having to negate time with her other group of friends to recharge.\n\nTexting/chat isn't the same as social interaction and time commitment so it's pretty easy to do that a whole lot.
4	How to approach a negative ISFP?	My friend ISFP, used to be a great guy. However, he's recently turned really sour, after being involved with a relationship that simply isn't for him. The problem is I'm not sure how to approach the situation, because I feel like if I just chew him out, that it might not be the best approach. \n\nAs ISFP's what's the best approach for you, or a fellow ISFP friend, when you or they start getting negative?
8	Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, sometimes it is best to just leave me alone for a while. 
7	Any ISFPs that went into a career of computer engineering?(or perhaps engineering in general)	I've just recently started college. Thinking about working hands-on with computer parts and computer systems was my main motivation to get an education, so I chose CE as my major. However, I question myself whether or not I'll still be motivated when the road gets tough.\n\nI'm curious to know if there are any other ISFPs in here that went into an engineering career and enjoyed it or had to give up on it. Also what branch/field interested you most?(mostly interested in CE fields because there are so many paths to choose from). Where are you now? Are you enjoying your career?\n\nAlso, do you guys like mathematics? I've really enjoyed math as far as calculus goes so far.
4	When I started college I was in mechanical engineering. I thought it sounded cool but hadn't really thought about it or what I wanted much at all. I ended up joining the college FSAE combustion racing team and getting really involved with that to the exclusion of all else. I loved the hands on work and actually building stuff and being on a team with people who actually seemed to like me (as opposed to my abusive family). But the farther I got into engineering classes and requirements the less I liked it. I hated calculus 1 and had to drop it because I wasn't doing well in it and had become suicidal for the first time. Then I stayed on the team but changed from Engineering to undecided for a while. I worked with career counseling and my therapist and she suggested I look into Public Health. I plays better to my strengths and is something I care about and is still problem solving which I like. I changed my major to public health and am still working on my degree. I sometimes wish I could have done engineering but I had to choose my health or I could have died. I do seem to enjoy my public health classes and am still figuring out exactly what I want to do with my degree as a career but that doesn't mean engineering won't work for you. I'm sorry if my post is depressing, I have had a bad past and childhood and relationship with my family and have depression ADHD and anxiety possibly tied to the emotional neglect and abuse but I'm working on recovering from that too. It makes my situation in college pretty different and challenging so maybe in a different life I could have done engineering but I have to try to do what works for me now
3	ISFP here.\nComputer Information Systems is one of my majors, but I wouldn't say I have a "career" yet.\nOn the mathematics side, I've always done well in math and it comes very naturally to me. I like how it's logic-based. I got through Calc 3 and Differential Equations in high school and part of me always wishes I'd gone into Physics.
2	sounds like a fun sex move.
26	Chameleon syndrome?	With my go-with-the-flow personality, I find that I seem to rewrite my entire brain to reflect whoever I spend the most time with.  This has happened in friendships and romantic relationships. It's such a gradual process that I don't see it until afterwards, like after a breakup or after I move on to a new group of friends. \n\nI used to think of it as my own personal growth and evolution, but I recently was told very harshly that I have no mine of my own and it's scary how easily influenced I am. Since then I've caught myself doing it and it really bothers me.\n\nDo you ever feel like you are such a laid-back pushover that you lose yourself, and you have trouble remaining true to a self that you bury without thinking? \n\nSince it was pointed out to me, I've gotten way better at identifying what feels like "me" and what feels fake... but I want to become stronger so that I can stop getting into harmful relationships where I let myself be so thoroughly controlled that I become a completely different person.
11	This is also very much like me. However, I know that I'm doing it and came to realize that a lot of times it is actually very useful to do. The trick is to be aware of it and keep your own filter on. It can be quite hard but it is also a way to learn from others and copy the things you admire in them, or to try out new characteristics and see how they fit you.\n\nI'm just realizing this as I am typing but I don't think this "not having a mind of our own" has much to do with not having an own opinion. What if it just seems like that because of a well developed empathic ability that makes it easy to see things from the other's perspective?\n\nGreat topic, curious what you all think.
9	As mentioned, I believe it is a result of being very empathetic. It's a unique ability. For me, the key is to surround myself with good people, especially people who understand the trait and don't take advantage or condemn.\n\nAfter frustration about trying to figure out who I was, I embraced this quality. I'm still working on "defining" myself, and as you understand, it's ever changing. Writing my thoughts down helps me develop my opinions, but I don't have the discipline to write as often as I'd like. \n\nMusic is very personal to me. I jotted down favorites and used those to discover more alike, developing this area the most. It gave me a sense of ground. I suppose this approach could be useful across the board. \n\nOn a side note, because of this trait I love reading non-fiction! It puts me in another world.
4	Yeah, I relate to this. I think it may be to do with enneagram 9, which is a common enneagram for ISFP. \n\nI feel like I don't relate to some descriptions of Fi dom because I don't really have very strong opinions or convictions all the time, and my personality easily changes depending on who I'm with.\n\nSometimes I'll find that I become a foil to sort of "balance" the energy. Like if I'm with very emotional people I'll become more cold and logical, with very logical people I'll be more emotional. If I'm with loud people I'll be quiet,  with quiet people I'm more talkative. But then also sometimes I will just start to act and talk like whoever I'm with, automatically agreeing with them. I always notice and it annoys me because it feels fake.\n\nI feel like I have a strong sense of self at some times and at other times I don't. I do naturally pay attention to how I feel before others, so I think doing that, reflecting and evaluating to figure out what I really think, what matters to me, and then just trying to be myself helps me to gain a better understanding and confidence in who I am, apart from others.
3	Absolutely feel this way. Sometimes I get frustrated because it feels like there's so many aspects of myself that contradict eachother I often find myself wondering who I am. I think it also has to do with the fact that we are very understanding and frequently place ourselves in the other person's shoes so we're able to relate. I personally make an effort to say okay I understand this person's perspective now how does that match up with my own beliefs.
3	Same here. I've found that I spend so much energy trying to adapt to others' mindsets that I've frequently lost sight of what I really want. 
3	Wow, reading this is incredible. My mother and I have a lot of tension, I finally lost it and told her she has no sense of self. She took the mbti test and she's an ISFP. Knowing this is common for the type helps, and understanding that it comes from empathy makes so much sense in context now. I owe her an apology. 
2	Yeah this is me exactly. I've over time developed my own opinions and values but sometimes i get caught in mirroring others
1	Yeah I do this a lot too. It's like I'm a different person depending on who I'm with. I've heard that it has something to do with empathy, but I'm not too sure about that. 
10	"ISFPs generally excel in and enjoy learning new things"	I see this posted a lot, and it couldn't be more different for me. I'm not sure if it's a confidence thing, but I absolutely hate learning new things or skills, particularly relating to work.\n\nI wonder if it's partly because I enjoy working in a hands-on, visual way, and the things I'm learning at work right now (i.e. programming interfaces or factory pattern methods) are all quite the opposite.\n\nDo you guys enjoy learning new things? Or does it depend (as I think it does in my case) very much on what you're learning, and how you're learning it?
10	I find that I usually like learning new things, but I have to be learning them, not being thrown into the deep end by myself and being expected to figure shit out on my own.
4	I learn by doing. And failing all possible ways while at it.\n\nBut when i fuck up, I remember and it won't usually do it ever again. So I guess I work things out while making them foolproof also xD
4	I like to learn new things provided I can do it autonomously, in my own way, and I can choose what it is that I'm learning. I hated school because I wasn't able to learn that way. \n\nI'm more so a hands on learner than anything but I'm quite visual as well. 
4	I am usually a slow learner, because I over complicate things, and I feel like if I don't understand every infinite detail of something then I don't understand it at all. I like to be thorough, and it's hard when I'm new at something and I only know the basics. I also think slowly in general, because my brain seems more interested in leisurely exploring an idea than in ever coming to conclusions.  It makes a lot of quick-thinking people assume I'm incredibly dumb at first because I'll always be frozen like a deer in the headlights when asked for my thoughts.  But later on, once I've gathered and sorted through all the details, people are surprised to discover that I have a much deeper and more analytical understanding of things than they thought I was capable of. Now that I've been at my job for a year and a half I feel like people trust me with the things I've learned, but they also understand I'm not the best person to dump a complicated new project on because I'll spend way too much time thinking about it without any visible results. 
2	I like starting to learn new things, but I have trouble once things start getting difficult. At first it might come surprisingly easily to me, but once it gets to that point where I start struggling I just can't get myself to keep going. My dad tried teaching me guitar once and he said I was picking it up way faster than he ever did. I was so into it at first, teaching myself simple melodies, learning chords, all that stuff. Then I started having trouble with changing from one chord to another and instead of working at it I just let myself lose interest. I know just doing it enough will build my muscle memory and it'll be easier with time, but I guess having a strong start made it hard for me not to get discouraged when it suddenly wasn't easy for me anymore. I really need to try getting back into it.
1	I usually like learning new things, especially if it's something I'm interested in, but if it gets frustrating or I have trouble understanding it then I won't enjoy it as much. \n\nI don't always like learning in a group setting because I find there's more pressure than if I'm learning myself. I also learn best hands on and visually, rather than just hearing a bunch of stuff
1	I wana see the beard!!!
1	I think learning things hands-on is a lot of fun, especially if it's the sort of thing that gives me immediate feedback (like an instrument or drawing). It's hard for me to actually get around to *start* learning something, but once I'm in the groove, I don't want to stop.
1	I dislike vague descriptions like that. Most people do enjoy learning. but learning what?\n\nI like learning things that help me improve myself overall. Currently I'm studying German after dropping it for awhile. Also reading up on homeschooling styles (I'd like to in the future if I have kids), the Protestant Reformation (partly because it's important to my heritage and also for a book I'm working on), and now some realist poets. When I was little I loved dinosaur movies and picture books and made up games with my dino toys. In 3rd grade I started my Greek mythology fixation that lasted a few years.\n\nI think what *generally* differentiates our motivations for learning from most other types is we want to get something out of it. We don't usually learn for its own sake like xNTPs. Look at Sherlock (ISTP but same Se placement as us). He has a variety of useful skills he's developed over the years, and he refuses to learn/hold onto information he considers "useless" like the movement of the sun. He also is a chemistry major- which helps his job in a huge variety of ways. Se wants flexibility.\n\nAnd LisaPizza made a good point. Some of us are slow learners (at least appear to be) because we want to grasp what it is we're learning carefully then try it ourselves. Se needs experience. Or rather, IS experience.
19	INTP here	I love you guys, you're all awesome, fuck ESFJ's and their bullshit dramas, thanks for reading my rant, bye 
11	thank 
8	I'm an ISFP and my husband is an INTP and we are like soul mates. INTP and ISFP are just meant to be together 👍
5	Well... we are both introverted P's so we most enjoy being alone together just chilling. Can be lounging around in the same room together reading on different devices and occasionally discussing some interesting detail we come across, or watching a movie together, going for a drive together... all that feels very stimulating and we don't feel the need to be around others or "go out". We both hate eating out and would rather get take out and relax at home rather than go out. But that is not overly often because I am an ISFP who has found my artistic outlet: cooking. \nMy "art" enriches his life. When he was single he hated going shopping and just bought things that we efficient (chicken patties for toaster oven for example). Now that we are married, I learned to make Jamaican food (his culture) to give him that loving connection and feelings you get from food you ate growing up- along with just good cooking and my own recipes in general. I'm also an extroverted sensor, so I enjoy going to the store and running errands for us, and he enjoys that he no longer has to.\nHe describes himself as a warm computer. He is not very in touch with his emotions. This means when he is hurt or angry- it's extreme. Imagine a overfilled boiling pot of soup that u suddenly have to carry. It's fine as long as u don't have to carry that pot, but if something happens and you have to pick that pot up- look out. I help him work through those emotions, calm down, and see different emotional perspectives. The ironic thing is that although he can get extremely emotional when he is upset, he is much better at anticipating my needs and the kids need than I am. He has extroverted feeling, which makes you think of others feelings/needs. I don't have that at all. So while I'm the do-er of the relationship, he is the director.\nWe openly describe ourselves as him being the brain and me being the hands.\nHe helps me be a better parent and make better choices because he is a thinking and a long term planner. He also intellectually stimulates me. Before him I was not a curious person. I would've never come across the idea of mbti for example and discovered this whole understanding of myself. He makes me a better person and a smarter person and a good parent. He even got me in a habit I could not manage life without now... wearing a watch and making notes on the calendar (not just appointments but notes like when to cut the kids toenails, what groceries to get at the store, when to give them a haircut, etc).\nAnd because he hates going around loud extroverted people... he hated the barber shop. I'm pretty handy, so I learned to cut his hair by watching YouTube videos and got so good I now cut out sons hair too. \n\nWow this has turned into a lot longer of a post than I anticipated. I'll just sum it up by saying that we don't step on each others toes much and have only had a handful of arguments since we have been married (5 years, and another 1 year dating) and that's not too bad considering we are young people. He is 33 and I'm 25. We grew up poor and come from completely different backgrounds (culturally and ethnically) and have children and have moved cities twice. In all that time, pretty much no arguments. That is how strong the comparability is, that it can survive all that. We have become better people together and more capable of coping with life and fulfill each others needs in life and emotionally. We trust and live each other completely.
5	Well honestly I'm not really sure. I don't think feelings are something someone really can control. It's only our reaction to those feelings that we can try to control. Most of the time, changing how we feel about something or someone takes time and calm thinking. Even then, feelings can't always been changed.\nFor example: I might, in time, be able to forgive someone for saying something offensive to me or for mistreating me in some way because they were not aware that their actions were hurting me.\nHowever, (I'm not going to use me or my family as an example in this one because I'm a little superstitious) say some family were hit by a drunk driver and all but one person in the car was killed. Say the lone survivor never let go of their feelings of hate and anger for the drunk driver- that is completely normal. The only thing that person can control is if the chose to forgive them, hunt them down and kill them, or numbly go on with their life in a state of depression. It's our actions we can try to control, not our feelings. Which is why certain personality types (typical Ps or Fs) would be more susceptible to drug addiction... because we are looking for ways to numb our feelings or control our feelings. But we can't and ultimately it only leads to more issues in our life. Life actually does suck and is depressing, but we are here, so all we can do is try to find meaning and a reason to live and purpose for ourselves. I'm not talking about religion, but something that makes you feel like it's worth it to get out of bed and try your best today.
10	Editing posts	I don't know if this is a type-specific thing but does anyone edit their posts a lot? Typos bug the hell outta me and there always seems to be something missing when I hit post, like for every idea there's three more details I wanna add. Or being overly cautious of the tone and worried it would be conveyed differently. When I'm texting with friends it's not a big deal and I'm more likely to use "u" and "ur" instead of you and your, but on more discussion based places like Reddit I'm terrified of coming across as illiterate. 
5	Yes I do\n\nEdit: I do it a lot actually. \n\nEdit 2: I don't think that it is type specific\n\nEdit 3: I'm so lonely :(
4	~~I don't really I'm not really afraid of coming across illiterate unless I'm saying something important really important,~~ \n\nActually yes I do try to make sure I sound literate unless I'm just making a joke and I won't include a ~~type~~ typo unless it's intentional or adds some effect. But yes I do edit my posts ~~like so much~~ a lot, I worry about my tone and whether I'm explaining it just right and coming off the way ~~i~~ I want to. And it's just very hard to put ideas and feelings into words sometimes and I don't want to get it wrong. I also might think of how something I said could be interpreted differently and want to prevent that, ~~or I just think of a bunch of other nuances~~ and I'll think of more details I want to add, places I should be more specific/less specific, etc.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nEdit: apparently you can't do a strikethrough within a strikethrough, lol
2	Even when I'm texting someone or in a conversation, I tend to ramble because I'll think of a better way to phrase a thought or idea, and just re-state it in different words.
1	I edit a ton.\n\nI won't even use "u" or "ur" in the most casual of conversations unless I'm purposely trying to be obnoxious.
3	Magic and madness	I'm obsessed with things feeling just right. Ex:This is perfect right now, feels right for this unique moment. Neither the "feeling right" or the "moment" are perfect by themselves..but both together make it a unique, once in a lifetime occurrence, no matter how small. \n(It can be any number of things in any order)\nThis is what I consider magic in reality.\n\nWhen I'm told to dig deeper into this feeling I get insulted. Why would I dig to try and find something to consciously control it when I already have it happen organically. I have tried.. A lot. Each time I've damaged myself deeply trying to get the answer to this "magic". Some might consider this denial of something, others say it's a form of stubbornness, and worst of all it's attributed to being oblivious. When in reality all that is happening is my attention shifts to a different area than those around me. I pay attention to the feeling in the room the feelings of the people around me. Only when this core function is suppressed is when I retreat to my head. It's the only safe place if no one understands. I don't even care if they truly understand as much as I care that it's viewed so negatively. Although I see their point and agree that me being another person would be ideal, I am who I am. Human beings need acknowledgment from time to time. How can one acknowledge what one cannot concept.\n\nI don't hate who I am, I hate how I'm perceived. To change that I have to change who I am, and fuck absolutely every single thing about that.\n\n(I understand change needs to occur and I work everyday to grow and be a better person, please don't mis interpret that)\n\nPeople believe in religion, spirituality, superstitions, and other stuff that in reality don't "exist" (I know I know we each have our own reality yeah I fucking get that.. I get it). So why can't things be more than what they are.\nI literally forgot what I was talking about at this point into writing this. Brain is fried.\n\nFor what it's worth I don't do drugs or drink often to alter my state of mind. This is simply how I feel. Very rarely can I put it into words, even though I felt it didn't really translate well, but I did my best.\n
8	ISFP Discord chat	So continuing off this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/5kvsvj/any_isfp_group_chats/) I've decided to come up with a ISFP Discord chat where we all can mingle with each other and chat, you know? I know we're small but I hope we can find some common ground and a place to chat :)\n\nI won't make this a hard and fast rule but I'll trust y'all with the link here. As far as possible I'd like to keep it to people within our type though, (since I believe there are already other avenues for other types to talk to each other) I hope you don't mind? :)\n\nhttps://discord.gg/uymZnN8
3	Anyone do Tai Chi?	I hear a lot about meditation on this sub, and Tai Chi looks very relaxing.  Does anyone do it and/or have any recommendations on how to pick it up?

6	ISFP dumpers/Dumpees - What are you like?	As an ISFJ, when the other person disappears from my life, I would usually feel really hurt and rejected even if I believed that it probably wouldn't work out in the long run.\n\nHow do you usually feel when you break up with someone? Are you able to switch off your emotions and move on quickly? 
12	If you have an emotional bond to someone, there is no way of turning them off, there is only a way to hide them, sometimes from yourself and sometimes from others. There is no such thing as switching them off. The thing with emotional bonds is that, after a time they get looser and looser.
2	No, it took me over a year to get over my (ex) wife after our divorce.  It hurt a lot. 
1	Either I try my best to hold on to the friendship... but if I give up even though I still want to be friends with them I'm just the kind who would cut off completely... but I'd feel really bad.\n\nLike the time I broke up and posted on here as u/GuestJoking I think I had trouble loosening that emotion bond. I'm trying my best, but it still hurts.
1	I broke up with my girlfriend a while ago and it was tough. I just felt, I'm wasting my time. She didn't support me, we didn't have anything in common. We had sex as a solution to her boredom. She worked as a waitress about 40 hours per month for really bad payroll. I just had to move on. I still think about her. She had an impact of how much future GF/Wife should be like. But the break up was awful. She would call me few times a day and sometimes she would come to my home door...
6	Similar to another post, what are songs that just resonate with you, that you find beautiful, an extension of yourself	I just discovered that I'm an isfp believing that I've been an infp for many years and boy is it spot on. I saw a post discussing which songs resonate with your souls and I couldn't answer since it was archived so let's discuss it again!\n\nThis right here.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FAra_A_vSd0\n\nThis song brings out so many emotions I can't even begin to describe why but it's so beautiful.
2	At the moment, probably this one:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBE7Ub2hoF0
1	I'm an ISTP and I like that song.  Another movie song I like is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pl-kro-5fc).  If you decide to watch that movie, watch the Director's Cut.
1	Pothole by modern baseball, Portugal by walk the moon

1	this one (for now)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKDt8Ks-LYw\nedit: i just looked at what you all put i my choice i VERY different from all of yours
1	The video you linked is unavailable :( But I searched it up and that is beautiful.\n\nI really like [Caves by Jack's Mannequin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhh4phuNty0)
1	No heart by 21 savage
1	[Metamorphosis by Blue Stahli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtGA-xcL958) has been hitting me hard on and off over the last year or so. This has been a transformative year for me, with a lot of pain but a lot of things to be proud of.
8	Fluffy type descriptions	I apologize if this has been discussed to death but does anyone feel like their type is very...fluffy? I'm not sure how to describe it but when I compare our type descriptions to others we just seem so plain. It's not that I'm ashamed of my type or anything. It's just a bit disheartening when other types don't know much about us other than the fact that we're very nice, emo, and artistic. It bugs me when people describe us like we're the less deep INFPS. I wish people would go beyond the stupid stereotypes. Anyone feel this?
8	I want to know that you are much loved, haha. I came across isfp because I thought that's what my husband was now I'm thinking he might be an istp but either way I got to know isfp is really well in that time especially through their Facebook group and I really really like them. No arguing which is rare for Facebook they were super supportive of me trying to figure out what type  he is and you guys are very very intelligent and talented and I understand the fluffy explanations of mbti because I've had issues with their ENFJ archetype description. They make a sound like we're always running around frantically trying to help other people when it's not asked for and in reality I'm more the friend that people come to because they know I give good advice and because they know I'm always going to be in their Friendship Circle and be there for them. I don't like how they make me sound like I have no life and that my life revolves completely around other people. This is because archetypes are not meant to determine type. Because there's no way to describe every single isfp and all of their behaviors and every ENFJ and all of their behaviors because people are so individualistic it would be impossible to nail it down that specifically. There's a huge variety an isfp I've noticed \n\nSomething that might make you more proud of your type is that I learned that ISFP are very intuitive sensors. One of their cognitive functions is Ni I believe and you can learn to develop it and become more intuitive. \n\nAlso being an intuitive type I can tell you that it's a lot more overrated than it seems. I have a friend who once was typing people based on if they have trivial conversations based on curtains and things you can see or if they had deep conversations and that's how she would tell people apart from intuitive's and sensors. This wasn't completely and totally wrong. I found that sensors in general are very much the bread to an intuitive butter. I like sensors because they are extremely grounding for me. My husband is a sensor and I wouldn't have it any other way because he is practical and he helps me appreciate the Here and Now and the sights and sounds that I miss every day. He has me leave my phone in the car and has taught me to be in tune with my senses and it's actually made me feel very peaceful. The Stars seem brighter the taste of my coffee is better and the whistle of the wind in nature is louder and I know it sounds really crazy but these are very important things and sensors tend to be more observant of their environment and they tend to be more Mindful. I'm trying to be more mindful because it's a very wonderful thing to pick up on the many things around you and your environment. \n\nIsfp have a lot of special things about type and they are honestly the easiest to talk to I would rather talk to you guys then another intuitive. Because only God intuitive thinkers and intuitive feelers usually have that irritating special snowflake thing going on and they only research other intuitive's or other thinkers and they particularly act like they're not human on purpose I think lol. Hope this made you feel better and I hope people start to realize that we are not our type. We have mbti to help us understand ourselves a little better but it is not a textbook definition of Who We Are.\n\nSorry this was so freaking long
5	Yeah, the description does a lot more harm than good in my opinion. I don't think that ISFPs are any less "deep" or complex than INFPs. We just go about the world in a different way. 
3	i feel this very much! your use of the word 'fluffy' really gets me especially because there's next to nothing talking about any deeper darker parts of our type. I think this is a problem for most sensors on the internet, though the xSTPs seem to be making a name for themselves recently. The wannabe, simplistic infp stereotype is annoying as hell. So yeah, I feel you.
3	yes. ISFPs are one of the most misunderstood types. I feel like every description of us online are misleading. It annoys me when other types, especially Ns, think we are "simple".
2	As an ENTP whose type description is extremely exaggerated, I totally agree with you, MBTI descriptions are definitely intuitive biased. I mean, ENTPs are cool but not that cool. It says "genius minds, devil's advocate who is starving for attention and information" yet here I am watching buzzfeed tasty videos and rolling on my bed.
2	Yeah, hey, so I'm an INFJ that is lurking here to see what you guys are like because I don't really know any ISFP's in real life and I don't really get what you guys are "all about."\n\nSo this topic is funny to me because as an INFJ I feel like there is a lot of bullshit surrounding descriptions of my type: "Empathetic mystical catalyst wizard blahblahblahs."\n\nSo I guess all I can say to you is you aren't the only person who hates the preconceived type descriptions.
1	this is less of a response to the question but reading the title made me think of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRC4Vk6kisY
1	yes! i agree with this! as a lurking enfp, i find that my description is very specific and very true to me, whereas when researching the elusive isfp, there were a lot of general things, and very few useful things for this personality type. i had to do a lot of my own research (mostly, reading through this subreddit), and found commonalities that weren't necessarily listed online, things like shyness, isfp's being really really funny (a lot of my isfp friends make hilarious quirky remarks that leave me doubled over in laughter), cautious, passive, musically/artistically talented, especially prone to touch and acts of service as love languages etc :)
2	What's your enneagram?	My enneagram is 9w1 I think, however I need to look more in depth about it. The subtypes and all those tritypes confuse me, I admit. From what I've read 9s or 4s are common amongst our type. 
3	4w3 :)
2	I'm 9w1! sp/so. Tritype probably 945 or 954? Honestly I think tritypes are not super important tho. \n\nOh hey you're the one who commented on my enneagram thread, aren't you? Hello!
2	I'm 7w6 (tritype 748)! I find that you can be any combination of enneagram and type, though I agree it is highly unlikely that you'll find idk many isfp 5w6s out there :)
1	I'm ennegram 2. \n\nI like to liken it to a quote from a show I like " The helper seeks to help because (s)he knows what it is like to be helpless"

2	ISTP or ISFP?? How do you handle difficult emotions and stress	I've been trying to figure out if my husband is ISTP or ISFP. So I decided to look into how each type is under stress. As a teen he belonged to a fight club. Part of it was because he enjoyed fighting and partly because it was his way of coping in a difficult time. What do you guys think?
2	It sounds more like he might be ISTP. I'm an ISFP who dated an ISTP and he coped in odd ways, as opposed to ISFPs who cope by being artistic or just crying. Just in my experience. Sorry if this doesn't help very much.
2	I'm sort of in between the two types and I tend to bottle up everything until I get really anxious and have an eventual breakdown and panic attack or get really depressed and suicidal or both. But I have depression and anxiety so I may be an extreme case. When I handle it more constructively I do something physical like a bike ride, walking or shoveling or something constructive that I'm good at like fixing something like a car or working on something like cleaning a garage or waxing a car or something like that. I usually need to be alone but i certain times with the right person I trust like my therapist I need to talk about it and vent. It's usually what works best but I only get that once per week. Sorry if my reply is all over the place but I tend to cope in a variety of ways usually a combination of all of them not just one thing. 
3	Isfp or intj?	I've taken the Meyers Briggs rests plenty of times and either come up with an ISFP or INTJ almost exclusively., depending on my mood at the time. Does anyone else see this kind of variation from time to time?
4	ISFPs and INTJs are similar in many ways because they both have the same functions, just listed differently\n\nISFP: Fi , Se , Ni , Te\nINTJ: Ni , Te , Fi , Se\n\nSee how similar they look?
4	Look in to the relevant functions 
2	If I'm really stressed and have no plan to 'get out', I test ISTP.\n\nBut I'm definitely INTJ.  Google a test for functions in the mbti stack.  It'll help to categorize what functions you use most and paint a clearer picture.\n\nWhich description did you feel you identified with more?
1	Update?
1	[ENTJ] You need to be taking cognitive functions tests when you're in your ideal, natural state of mind.  Otherwise, you'll be all over the place, thinking you do something when you likely don't do so (as often) otherwise.  Show us a brief insight into your thought process... try to look into the inferior functions [Se for INTJ, Te for ISFP].  Which do you try improving upon rather consciously, rather than simply using it rather naturally?
1	A lot of isfps think they're intj because they assume they're unique and introvert, once I see their chubbiness they are not intj
14	Where are all the iSFPs?	How come this sub is so small, when we are a bigger part of the population than INFPs for example, but /r/infp is 10 times the size of /r/isfp? I hardly ever come across other ISFPs in MBTI chat rooms and forums, even the only facebook group is really tiny compared to other MBTI groups. I know there are several INFP groups on facebook because ours they just get too big to enjoy after a while. 
21	I often read posts here and wish to be more active. It's just that when I start typing my comment, I would see a similar comment and I would stop typing all together because what needs to be said had been posted. \n\n\nThere are also times when I would see a post that I can relate to or have a lot to say about, and my mind would start working overtime and before I know it I have poured out my heart on an essay. Right before I finish it I would imagine my post being ignored because nobody really understands all the feelings I had about that topic, so I close the tab and go on my merry way. \n\n\n\nOh and I almost didn't reply to your post :)
8	I don't know about anyone else, but whenever I'm in an mbti chat room I just kind of observe. 
6	I really wish the different types were equally represented online.\n\nMany INFPs on the internet tend to be in a self-discovery, Fi-Si tertiary loop of reflecting on who they are and exploring that, so online forums and studying MBTI are a perfect avenue of endless activity for them.\n\nOne of my best friends is an ISFP, and most of his time spent on the web is either research for the competitive video games he's playing or on YouTube looking up stuff that are more in the lines of history and big-picture conspiracy theories. He goes into endless, big-picture research mode that I think are expressed well as Fi-Ni tertiary loops.\n\nThat, and the auxiliary function of Se in their cognitive stack lends themselves to be interacting with the world in real-time/physical reality more than other types that find themselves online more.
6	I wouldn't be surprised if there were quite a few people who identify as INFPs that are mistyped ISFPs.  We're very similar, so it can be easy to confuse the two.\n\nSpeaking for myself, and I've heard many fellow ISFPs agree with me, I just never know what to talk about :/ 
3	I spent quite a bit of time on the Internet for someone who is described as being more into "experiencing the real world" lol. I'm very interested in MBTI but I don't always go on Reddit to read. I like personality cafe and typology central because it's more active though I never post, just lurk. I prefer to read posts and usually someone says something in a more eloquent way and therefore I upvote. Sometimes I comment on posts, but I'm not much of a poster. I feel like everyone has already exhausted some of the same topics and I don't wanna repeat any of them. I'd rather read the discussion than participate in it tbh.
3	I have a feeling it's because we experience the world in our senses so immediately that most of us don't **directly** seek out information regarding our self-identity.\n\n\nWe're more interested in the pursuit of our interests rather than the "why we are who we are" because having Se (Extraverted Sensation), we have a natural affinity with our environment so I'm thinking it's probably why the majority of us don't lurk as much on mbti-related type discussions.\n\n\nNot to imply that we don't think about our self-identity a lot, we just.. do it in a way where it's more personal to us (our dominant function is Fi, Introverted Feeling, anyway). We'd rather be exploring our self-identity alone rather than dialoguing about them (more of an Fe thing), whether to a friend or on a forum online, ..unless we're directly asked/come to a conclusion that makes us curious about this. It's all about direct experience, Se again.\n\n\nIt's funny haha because when I came across this thread, I feel like.. *yes*, I'm pretty sure most of us mainly lurk (like most of y'all have mentioned) and we directly soak up the experience by staring at our computer screens, either approving or disapproving but not really feeling the need to 'interfere'. \n\n\nAlthough in normal social terms, our 'interfere' is probably what most think as 'participate' and probably what most of us are already conditioned to think. Though that's not our natural milieu so we instinctively just sit back and watch. Which.. brings us back to lurking!!\n\n\nI hope I'm not theorising so much but like the rest of us ISFPs, I've been on PersonalityCafe a lot reading about situations that _only_ can be applied to my current life. I imagine it's the same for the rest of us(?)\n\n\n(if you notice, I use "**direct**" a lot to try to express that in whatever we do, it's gotta be because of us and how it, again, _directly_ affects us xD)\n\n\nWe prefer\n\n1. not to bring up something which has been already mentioned\n\n2. to talk about something when we feel like we've gathered enough resources that when we reread it, it **must** feel like it's explained the whole situation\n\n\nAll this talk has made me realise that.. perfectionism is hard on us because it's extremely difficult to produce something in accordance to the feelings-gasm we want {rofl} when we're not so naturally inclined, [functions-wise](http://www.typeinmind.com/fise/ "how our functional stack affects us!") (Fi, Se), to think of why we feel and think the way we do.\n\n\nIf anything, we know why we think the way we do but it's kind of hard to put it into words when we're soaking up the *entire* experience and while we're trying to translate all of that to words, it feels like EVERYTHING that we want to explain is just a mere 30% or less, idk.\n\n\nOur life is a direct representation of our art (note: self-expression). Nothing more, nothing less. We don't explain it much like most types do, we'd rather act on it. Considering how laid-back we are, I think it's possible most of us don't think of MBTI that much to begin with unless we've learnt the direct application of the theory to the world.\n\n\nWow, kinda a long post haha. I kind of had an epiphany in the middle >:X\nAnd to relate to those who've read this, yeah I feel like I probably didn't explain this properly. (fun fact: it took 45m to re-edit this so that it sounds more coherent) so yes.. it's a lot of effort for us to just post/do something we're satisfied with in the end.\n\n\nThe key is in how satisfied we are with the end-product. If it doesn't feel good enough, then most of us won't contribute. XD And even if we do, we often check back to see if there's anything we can improve on it.
2	Maybe most of them isn't active on reddit but in their arts and craft rooms. Just kidding, maybe in their garage making some space theme music. Honestly, I had more infp friends than isfp, actually I am the only isfp I know in person. Maybe because I hardly socialize with girls. 
2	We are easily distracted and have a hard time committing to one thing.
2	Personally, i think most of us are lurkers lol i had to actually sign up for reddit to post here, even though ive read stuff on reddit before. And also maybe a tendency to reithink what is written and deciding not to send it at all
1	I'm in the MBTI Discord server and I can tell you that we kinda seem to be small too.
1	The ISFP funtions:\nFi\nSe\nNi\nTe\n\nYou are an introvert so your fi and ni fuctions speak strongly to you. \n\nIn the myers briggs test there are questions that concern dominant N vs S. You guys with such a strong Ni relative to other s types get mistyped as Infps. \n\nIn the face threads, I have observed two distinct camps of eye feels. The warm charming, disarming often brown in colour are the infs. The starkly present in reality, sympathetic, slightly cautious/concientious eyes that are mostly blue are the isfps.\n\nDon't know why there would be colour camps like this, what it means or if it could mean anything at all. I have thought about it quite a bit, but I have no reasonable theory.  \n\nTldr: Isfps are at the infp sub. Might explain why that sub is bloated relative to infp pop size and ratios seen from other mbti subs.
1	The type of story you wish you could have or write?	So it can be a Movie, TV Show or Book. 
2	I have been trying to work on a dystopian kind of work but I only got like a paragraph down and left it stale for like a year already. Also I would like to write about being lost by love and finding yourself again, refer to Norwegian Woods by Murakami. 
5	ISFP and the new year!	Hi guys just wanted to make a little post to see about some of your New Year resolutions or things you simply want to improve on! I really want to focus on my passions in 2017 and exactly what I want to do with work. I tend to feel a little lost when it comes to narrowing down what my exact line of work will be, but time will tell! \n
2	I never really think about making New Years resolutions until people ask me and I realize I don't have any. But I realized I do have goals I want to work towards, even if I never label them as "goals" or "resolutions" in my mind. So I came up with this list riding the free skytrain last night:\n\n* stretch every day\n\n* write a diary entry every day\n\n(and by every day I mean more days than currently, I'm not that strict with myself lol)\n\n* rest my eyes more, spend less time staring at screens\n\n* do more art\n\n* be more organized/less forgetful\n\n* be less shy \n\n* get a part-time job hopefully\n\nI think focusing on passions is a great thing for all of us to do if we can. I hope all goes well with your work and that you find something you really love :)
1	I too have trouble finding work that I love. I don't really make resolutions because I know I won't accomplish it in anyway 
1	[deleted]
1	I want to be the best version of myself. Im tired of people seeing me as a pushover. I want to be more domineering. I hate the fact that I lack self confidence. I am working on that and I want to be happy with myself a year from now.\n\nFor now I feel that I'm unwanted. So ya. I must be the best version of myself. 
26	How do I stop being so lazy?	The thing is if I have something to do, I get it done and even sometimes get obsessed with it. but when I dont have anything to do I'm super lazy and don't initiate anything because I'm totally fine just doing pretty much nothing. A lot of the time it feels like im wasting potential\n\nAnyone relate to this? How can I start getting the motivation to initiate things, be organized, etc like a J does? 
22	Yeah, I can relate. I think as ISFPs, we don't really like making plans for ourselves, we just want to do whatever we feel like in the moment, even if that's nothing. Often I tell myself, "I will do ____ today!" Then I don't do it and am totally fine with it because I did what I felt like doing at the time. \n\nPersonally, I like to keep a list on my phone. Just anything I want/need to do when I have time. I'll be honest, some of those things take a loooong time to get crossed off, but having them down is a constant reminder, and it feels super satisfying to tick something off, so it does help a bit. \n\nAnd really, just start! Starting things is always the hardest, but I find, in most cases, it's so much easier to continue and finish once you start, and being productive feels really really good! But also, don't worry about giving yourself a bit of time to just "do nothing", it's good relaxation. 
4	I totally relate to this. I even get bored of playing the same games after a while. I don't understand how people play the same games for months/years. \n\nBut yeah, my gf is INFP and she's pretty motivated to doing stuff, but I'm perfectly content just sitting around after work and just watching TV. I can't even get motivated to switch to reading :/
4	Use 3 goals system. On beggining of day. Set Yourself 3 tasks to do. They can be simplest tasks on earth(laundry, dishes, buy new shoes). At the end of day, sum it up. Did you succeed or have You failed? And same for next day. \n\nAlso set Yourself 3 tasks for a week and 3 for a month and 3 for a year. I really like this system. Maybe I should do an app for that?
1	Get rid of distractions 
3	Any ISFP group chats?	Are there any ISFP group chats? I would like to join.
2	I don't know of any but i did had conversations with other said isfps in the facebook group, it was a large group so people are constantly chatting. But it is mostly just people posting their drawings and you can start conversations through the commenting

5	making ourselves vulnerable	 Hey guys, I'm an isfp and I have a big problem with allowing myself to be vulnerable when talking to someone close to me. For example, I messed up with a close friend of mine and he confronted me and got mad and at first I tried to avoid confrontation, but now I feel like I really have to open up in order to make an honest apology and let him know I understood what upset him.\n  This being said, allowing myself to open up when he might refuse what I say is something that scares me a lot, do you guys feel this way too?
8	enfp girl here :) just putting in my two cents :) after doing research about my isfp guy, and through talking to him, I've found that he is a lot more cautious than I am in what he says and in opening up. I find that for me, it's fairly easy to open up to someone because I am a risk taker, and a bit reckless in most areas of my life (emotional intimacy, speeding, the things I say). That being said, I would say that it's hard for any person to open up to apologize, no matter what personality type you are, because the other person might reject your apology. However, if you really care about that person, that's a risk that you have to be willing to take if you still want the relationship, and if you did something wrong, it's the right thing to do regardless of the outcome. Hope it works out! I figured that you would want a response to your post :) 
23	ENFP girl asked out by ISFP guy	Thanks to r/isfp, I was able to do the following things:\n\n-(After being asked out but before we went out) texted the guy several times, Christmas Eve, Christmas, how his day was   \n\n-After waiting for him to make the first move, asked him to coffee   \n\n-Texted him to let him know that if he needed space, he could let me know and I would be ok with it   \n\n-After slow textual responses, asked him to take a walk with me through Ikea, which he really liked   \n\n-Told him that I liked him in the car and that I didn't want to push him, but that I needed some reassurance that he liked me and that I was willing to be patient with him so that we could build up trust   \n\n-He was more open (even texting me first) after I told him that I liked him outright (which was scary), and told me that it was really thoughtful of me to have researched his personality type to better understand him and that he liked feeling more understood. He also told me that he would work on initiating more and being more relational which I am super excited for   \n\n\nI really like him, so thank you this subreddit!! This place helped me better understand that it was a big freaking deal when he asked me out because it was a big risk on his part! I would have never known that he liked me and even after he asked me, I still wasn't sure because he wasn't very effusive or affectionate, but thanks to this subreddit, it helped me to not be so insecure and just be patient.     \n\nI am excited for what is in store and will probably be back in the future. We haven't gone out on our official official date yet, where he asks me out and sets the time and place, but for now I want to give him that space to do that so he knows that I care that that is what he needs. There's more I want to say, but I don't want to overwhelm, so I'll keep it short (ish)!\n\nPS, sorry for the not conciseness, ISFP's, I ramble :o\nEdit: formatting\n
3	Wow you sound amazing. I know I would feel more comfortable if someone straight up told me I can never tell
6	What Do You Do For A Living?	
3	Software Developer (Ruby On Rails) for small company
2	I am the Mobile Device Administrator at a construction company. Basically I work in IT and manage all the cell phones in the company. 
2	I would enjoy being a Fortune Teller but I am instead trying to get a job at an old game store.
2	Programmer (currently working in C# .NET) and absolutely hate it. 
2	Information Security Analyst in the financial industry.  
1	Christmas temp at a uk discount chain store. It's not the most fancy, glamourous job but it's something - plus the staff are a fun bunch! :)
1	Archival conservator for a state agency.  I clean and preserve historical documents and did museum work before this.
1	Technical Writer in the aviation field. Quiet work :)
1	Financial Analyst, Audit, Investment Banking
1	Echo technologist. I scan hearts using ultrasound. 
1	Industrial electrician- manufacturing controls , plcs, vfds
7	Mental issues	Do most isfps have mental issues? Not to be rude but just looking around this sub Reddit seem like most have self esteem issues and are depressed. 
7	I don't think I have mental issues and I'm not depressed, but my self-esteem is pretty unstable. Like the other person said, it's probably Fi that makes us especially sensitive, though anyone can have mental health issues. 
5	Diagnosed general anxiety disorder, undiagnosed depression. I actually have high self-esteem just bad life circumstances and bad people in my life that I can't let go of. I think the feeling part of the isfp personality causes us to be more likely to have mental health issues.
4	I've read that ISFPs are the most likely type to be depressed :( like someone said before me it's probably due to Fi and our reluctance to deal with the conflict and end up bottling up our feelings 
3	Depression, Anxiety and ADHD have emotionally abusive and neglectful parents and basically no self esteem
2	I have major depression but I try to deal with it in the best ways that I can. It's the main reason why I'm sort of obsessed with fitness. 
2	Not yet.
3	Typical Loser, soon to be college drop out :o	So I'm 3 months shy of being 22, never had a job. Im dropping out of college for a bachelor's, just had difficulties with the part time, let alone trying to pay for it. Anyway now I sit all day either at moms or dads while they support me still. \n\nSo, how are you guys in the career department? 
3	I'm 16 and unemployed except for occasional balloon twisting and face painting gigs on weekends. I'm thinking of getting a part-time job but too lazy to look for one and make a resume and all that work D:
3	There's a lot of entry level jobs you can do. like literally anything. Idk what your state's minimum wage is, but it's better than nothing. 
2	Try Coursera or something similar. 
2	Dropped out first semester, went back after a few month did 1 semester. After 2nd one came around didn't like it dropped out again. Only 3.7k in debt, working part time while having an online business that is growing. College isn't for everyone. Im 22, so around your age. There is plenty of decent jobs that doesn't need a BA, like if you become an EMT or something.
2	I'm 22 - I graduated high school with minimal credits, I've been working since I was 14 in jobs that I have had no training for. I currently work in IT at the corporate office of a large construction company with no schooling for the job is I do. \n\nI've learned that a load of bullshit will get you anywhere if you know what your doing. 
2	I'm 21. Been going to college for about 2 1/2 years and have finally picked a major(audio engineering). I just finished my first semester at a new school and am currently deciding if I want to continue this or persue something else. Have worked about 4 part jobs on off during my life. Don't feel like a loser most of us have no clue what we want to do. Sometimes things just happen.
2	I'm 25, got computer science engineering degree (spent 4 years) and an mba finance degree (spent 2 years), a job in one of the major investment banks (as a small time analyst, no big bling blings for me).\n\nAs all ISFPs I also struggle with sticking to studies and what career I want to pursue. I keep changing careers and all.\n\nDon't think of myself as a looser though because I know I can do anything I want to. The problem is that I am just not sure enough what I want to do.\n\nRecently I started having thoughts  of getting a doctorate, still not sure in what subject though. I feel teaching may be a career more suited for me.\n\n I am just not able to decide what work I want to do for my whole life like all the other ISFPs.
3	Thoughts on INFPs?	For a study being conducted by yours truly.
5	The INFP I know is quite immature for their age, so I don't mind spending time and having a laugh with them. However, over time more and more things annoy me - not being very open-minded or practical, telling me of dreams and plans though they have no intention of making happen, generally being away with the fairies makes me want to lasso them and pull them back down to earth.
4	Love them. A lot of my friends are INFPs. I get along very well with them. We're pretty similar in our humor and tastes in books. The only difference between us is that they're into the whole social justice thing and just generally want to help out the world. They get super passionate about what they like and go into tangents. On occasion those tangents bore but I do like listening to them talk about different perspectives on things that I have never realized before. 
3	Infps are usually pretty cool. Although sometimes I find it hard to follow what they are talking about :P
2	What about them?\n\nFor a while I thought I might be one, before I really understood functions.\n\nThe stereotypes about them are rather annoying, but sometimes true. I ended up unsubscribing to /r/infp for that reason, even though I did relate to a lot of the content.\n\nOne of my best friends/former roommate is INFP. We bond through our similarities and introversion.
1	One of my friends is an INFP and he often talks about SCPs and stuff i don't give a fuck about, and he doesn't care if i'm interested or not. \nMy stepmother is an INFP, and she is pretty annoying sometimes because she tries to be Mother Teresa or something 
6	Meeting other ISFPs	Maybe this is silly but I wish there was a way to meet people based on their personalities. I'd love to talk to another "me" and share similar thoughts. I've spent a lot of my life caring a lot about adapting to others and it'd be so nice to know some people where that wasn't the case too you know?
5	Yeah i found out I was just going along the flow without actually knowing who and what I want. My music and hobbies were cultivated from my friends influence, now we are all grown up and hanging out less, I start to see this isn't the stuff that i want. Ever since, I am learning more of myself and been working on me but soon I need to get myself out there and meet others. Might be quite unhealthy to be alone for too long. Anyways, try Meetup.com, search in isfp or something, or join the Facebook group isfp. But it'd be better to spot them irl, go to art events, craft markets. 
2	ISFP here. I am the same. I did not know about personality types until I met my INTP husband. We have moved away from our home towns and are pretty content with just each other and the kids. I used to long to meet fellow ISFP females, but since having a family, I am pretty content. I find that being just myself with the family has allowed me to be myself without all the influence from other personalities. I tend to just absorb traits from others. Until becoming more if a loner, I did not realize I'm actually a pretty outdoorsy person and I now enjoy taking the kids out in nature trails and neighborhood walks. I am also pretty creative as a domestic and enjoy being creative with cooking and crafts around the house.
2	I know it's stereotypical but you are likely to meet other ISFP's at an art class I think. I know it's stereotypes but I do know a lot of ISFP artists so I think taking some kind of art class would be a good bet. 
11	A slightly shy ESFP known as PeterDraws offers the world almost impossibly awesome and inspiring visual and auditory pleasures on his drawing (and talking) YouTube channel... Here's a recent video to introduce you to his work: ",swooping & swirling inkwash & drawing,"	
2	This is amazing..I find him very admirable. Like there are aspects of him that I want for myself and feel in myself but can't put out there.

6	I'm an ISFP	Hello like most of the problem post here mine is also about being in relationships. There is this girl I like and from what I can tell she likes me too. The problem is that I am scared of being in a relationship. I grew up around my parents who were always fighting and also emotionally abusive and on occasion physically. I am sacred that I won't know how to act in a relationship. I don't want to hurt this girl and there was other girls I have liked and was in the same situation. I never acted and that's why I have always been single. I am tired of being alone I guess. I have always been lonely as a kid since I was neglected by parents and never made friend because I was the weird depressed kid. I just want to say that my parents now have stopped being the way they once were and we are starting over our relationship. If I could get some advice or a hey I have been there or I am there too that would be great.      
7	Called her and ask her if she would like to go get coffee, she said no. I feel good though, glad I did it.

6	S's: Have You Ever Cheated?	I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:\nDid you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?
10	I've never cheated, but I have ended relationships just because I wanted to sleep with someone else.
6	I cheated with my long term girlfriend and struggled almost every day to tell her about it. But the longed I waited, the more I know it would hurt her and was scared she would leave me. We broke up almost year ago because of diffrent reasons. To this day she does not know. I learned my lesson and will never do that again...
6	I've never cheated, but have been cheated on. It's been such a painful thing to have to deal with: my sense of worth/confidence was shattered for a long time. I also have trust issues because of it. For this reason, I've vowed to never inflict that pain upon anyone else. 
4	I have not cheated.
5	I don't think being a sensor has anything to do with cheating. It depends on the individual.
3	Nope. I don't have the mental energy for that even if I wanted to.
3	About a month into my current relationship. Had an ex drunkenly contact/flirt with me. Slightly tempted, but resisted. I'm way too happy where I am to risk it for a one-night stand. Don't want to do that to myself or my SO.
1	Never
1	I never cheated but at the same time I only had 2 short relationships in the last 5 years. I'm closest to being an ISFP 
1	I have only "cheated" when I have made up my mind the previous relationship is over. Ex: dated a guy for 8 months, decided I wanted to end things but I was going on a trip and wanted to wait until I got home to end it in person. Ended up kissing someone I met on the trip and ended things with current boyfriend when I got back.
8	Any other ISFP's feel it's almost impossible to find motivation with seeing what you want in person first?	I need a career change. I'm leaning towards Physical Therapy Assistant. However, I have NO motivation to go through a 2 year degree and get liscencing. It feels exhausting and draining to even think about. I'm hoping I can find a way to mirror a PTA for a day, and HOPEFULLY that will inspire me to pursue. I feel like that's my only hope for motivation at this point. If the reward isn't immediate, it's damn near impossible to find motivation.\n\n\n\n 
3	I'm in the same boat friend as a fellow ISFP and feel exactly the same. I'm SO undermotivated to go back to school for a career change (to become a counselor). Part of it is the actual going back to school, but if I really wanted to be a counselor I'd suck it up and do it, or so I tell myself. But it's the fact that like you, I'm only leaning towards it because it's the best option I can think of, but is far from a dream come true. \n\nMy current perspective is to simplify my life and learn to enjoy the small things and embrace those moments, hobbies or relationships that give me joy, peace and some level of fulfillment. I don't know your scenario, but maybe you don't need more school or a new career at all...maybe it's an internal shift that will facilitate the motivation that you are looking for to live the life you want. Just my two cents.
3	It takes motivation to start something, discipline to see it through.\n\nSo schedule time every day to get it done and keep your eyes on the prize. You're gonna make it.
2	Motivation is in short supply for me most of the time as well. 
8	ISFP Travelers/ outdoorsy types?	Just discovered my "type" and, although I never put much stock into these personality things, I can't believe how well this describes me. Hadn't been on reddit in awhile but found you guys while googling.\n\nI was wondering about adventuring ISFPs. After studying abroad many places in college, and doing well in school despite my crazy procrastination, I couldn't commit to a real job after graduating and decided to solo backpack central america. \n\nI loved the independence of it, and also how I could learn so many new ways of living from so many different people. I loved how I never really had to plan, that I would just wake up and decide which city to go to or to stay where I was. \n\nFinally finished and settled down to work at a field station in a tropical rainforest. I love how each day is different and the environment around me is incredibly beautiful and hands-on; the mud, the rain, the bug bites, and bruises make everything very real. \n\nTo me, this job makes perfect sense with an ISFP- there's beauty and unpredictability, my work environment revolves around teamwork and harmony, not competition or advancement, only commit to 4 month projects. \n\nWondering if there are more ISFPs out there who find that working outdoors or traveling is what makes them happiest. \n
4	Honestly, this post sounds like a dream. I don't know how much I would actually enjoy a life like that, though. It sounds amazing but I'm afraid I would be too stressed/wimpy and sheltered. 
3	This is what I long for, but I don't know if I would be able to do it.... That fear has stopped me in the past from doing stuff like adventuring because I'm afraid
3	I absolutely love traveling, it's one of the most amazing things to for me. I'm more of an urban traveler (I like to visit different cities) but being out in nature is quite refreshing as well. \n\nI've always wanted to be a nomad of some sort. 
3	Yes! I constantly fight the urge to just sell everything I own and take off somewhere just wandering for a while. It's my deepest dream.
2	I can be quite outdoorsy if the weather is nice and spend hours out in the nature listening music and adventuring. What a joy.
1	I love traveling but it's important to me to have a home base to feel safe. I work in aviation and am often traveling for weeks at a time and every project I work on is different. I also enjoy the hands on aspect of my work - helping with repairs, fueling and other bush activities. I used to travel more for pleasure but because my job is so active, I like to recharge at home or go on sun vacations. 
6	Identity crisis, anyone?	I recently took the MBTI test again and learned I am an ISFP. I took this with a grain of salt at first considering the last few times I took it I got ENTJ, ENFJ, and ENFP. I told others I was an ENFJ for a little over a year, but after taking the test again I realized that ENFJ is an idealized version of myself. I've been striving to be an ENFJ for years, but nearly every ISFP trait fits who I really am. There were many traits that I immediately reacted to with "not me", but then after consideration figured out that if I'm being honest those traits are true to me. I've struggled with my identity for ad long as I can remember, but with ISFP, introspection and questions of identity are part of the basic characteristics. It also perfectly describes how I'm shy around new people, but the loudest person in the room if one of my good friends is there. Have any of you identified with different MBTI types in the past? Why do you believe you are an ISFP now?
6	Well typing by traits isn't a great way to go about it. It can lead to confusion and minor identity crisis like what you and alot of other people experience. You'd be better off researching the theory behind the dichotomy/trait surface level but I know not everyone can be bothered. There is this site that I saw linked on the MBTI mothersub the other day that had decent, basic descriptions of each type. [Here](http://www.typeinmind.com/fise/) is the page for the ISFP and [here](http://www.typeinmind.com/feni/) for the ENFJ. Do either stand out? 
4	As /u/SemperJ550 said, typing by traits can lead to confusion and uncertainty. Just going by the test, I get INFP just as often as ISFP. Other times I score around 80% S. The questions can be ambiguous and situationally dependent.\n\nLook into the functions of each type you think you might be. The test is an indicator but not the end all be all. The functions tell you how you think and view the world. That was what solidified my type beyond a doubt.\n\nThere was a good video I found on YouTube that was INFP vs ISFP and it explained the functions and how they view the world differently. I believe there were many others in the series comparing other types as well.
